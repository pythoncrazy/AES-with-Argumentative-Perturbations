31, " Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much."
20,  one time when i was skateboarding with my friend i got relay mad and i wanted to stop skating. His mom tried to convince me to keep skateboarding.Laughed and seed i will never be good enough to skate and she seed that i have improved than some of the people that she knows.That made me feel better than before and then i started skate boarding every day from then. When i think about that day i still laugh.skating can be fun in many ways.People can skate for fun and for compaction.There are different ways of skating people have there ways of skating.There are many different kinds of skateboards the people who skate them ride them different. Some of the people that ride skateboards i laugh at because the way they skate.   
40, " Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other. There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME1 when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS1 this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON1 laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 are @CAPS2 in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season."
34, "Interesting fly.It was the @DATE1 of this @DATE2,after a long @DATE1 with some crying @CAPS3 lots of goodbyes i was finally in the airport,waiting for my plane to @LOCATION1.I've been in that airport so many times...I love @LOCATION2 but it's always exiting to go in vacation @CAPS3 i @CAPS1 it with my parents pretty frecuency.Today it was different, this wasn't a vacation. It was going to be a whole year. @CAPS3 my parents weren't going to be there.Just think about being away from them @CAPS3 all my friends in @LOCATION2 for such a long time made my stomach sick. Expecialy because in @NUM1, i was going to be meeting my host parents that i never saw before @CAPS3 wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of complitely weirdos.Once in the plane i sat with a young girl that was in @LOCATION2 studing arquitecture @CAPS3 going back home for winter..when i was just going away from it.@CAPS2 asked ""@CAPS1 you speak english"" @CAPS3 i said ""I try to"" @CAPS2 laught,@CAPS2 looked nice,with a big smile,@CAPS2 was pretty too.We started talking @CAPS3 @CAPS2 felt how nervious @CAPS3 anxious i was.@CAPS2 asked me if i was ok @CAPS3 i told her that i was going to be a foreing stage studient for the next year @CAPS3 my concerns about it,like meeting people or missing home.@CAPS2 told me""you will be fne,dont worry about it..i wish i had that chance when i was your age""@CAPS3 then changed the subject.After a long conversation @CAPS2 started reading a magazine @CAPS3 i put on my music.When we were about to get @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all sudenly screamed so hard that made me jump,we laugh for a long time @CAPS3 @CAPS2 couldn't even talk to me @CAPS3 explain why did @CAPS2 scream because everybody was looking at us @CAPS3 that made it even more funny @CAPS3 kind off embarazing too so @CAPS2 could not stopt laughing.Then @CAPS2 told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went with her to highschool a few years ago @CAPS3 they were together for some time but since graduation they didnt know anything about each other.He was now working at a bank @CAPS3 making good money,really good money...@CAPS2 was going craizy talking to her self @CAPS3 asking why in the word @CAPS2 stoped talking with him.That good time with her,even if i haven't seen her again made me really happy @CAPS3 by the time we got off of the plane i was more confident @CAPS3 almost forgot about all the nervious that i was before.After @NUM2 months here,everything is going perfect @CAPS3 im sure that even if it was just a few laughs @CAPS3 not a really long time on that plane,when i go back @LOCATION2 @CAPS3 think about @CAPS4 i will think about her,@CAPS3 i'll count that moment as my first good @CAPS5 expierence."
36, "Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. "
45, "  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one."
30, "                        `   THE @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it, I fell off of a slippery trampoline.about four or five years ago I went too a friends house to stay the @TIME1. That day was a hot day so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH1 have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not."
39, " Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny."
35, " Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. "
35, " There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke."
35, "   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep."
40, " Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?"" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2.""   ""@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS13 guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar."" @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   ""@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man."""
32, " Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3."
33, " In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side."
60, " Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.  Bell rings."
40, "         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great."
40, " I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do."
28, "Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag."
38, " For me laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a seance of happiness. You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the forth of @DATE1. They have a big forth of @DATE1 walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS5 far @CAPS5 the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o clock. @PERSON1 and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS4 the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME1 @TIME1 was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minuets. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM1 o clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. @CAPS5 the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 mile per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said ""We should jump it!""  @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON1 leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter is the reason life is worth living.  "
40, " Just @CAPS1 walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were at @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times."
30, " ""Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1,"" the girl said. ""@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1,"" I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. ""@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent,"" @PERSON1 said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be."
37, "We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say ""@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to short to go unhappy then to have had a life without laughter."
34, " Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. "
36, " One day @CAPS17 I was having trouble trying to cope with some very big changes in @CAPS13 life, I seeked the help of a friend. Usually @CAPS17 i'm having a bad day I @CAPS14 keep to myself. This was an occasion @CAPS17 I need someone else there to help @CAPS2. @CAPS17 I went @CAPS5 met with @CAPS13 friend she tried all she could to cheer @CAPS2 up but nothing was working. @CAPS6 she said ""@CAPS1 hear a story?"" @CAPS2 wanting to hear anything that would take @CAPS2 out of this slump I was curently in said ""@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS12 think it will help.""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 she began.   ""The other day @CAPS13 family @CAPS5 I went grocery shopping. We were gone for probably four hours.

After we showed them all @CAPS13 father had to say was ""@CAPS7 @CAPS3 @CAPS12 put the dog treats up @CAPS6 she doesn'@CAPS11 get into them.""

I looked at @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 said ""@CAPS12 know what would be funny? @CAPS4 dad thought the dog treats were cookies @CAPS5 ate one."" @CAPS13 sister giggled. Our dad came stomping into the living room @CAPS5 threw himself on the couch, acting like a four year old boy who @CAPS14 got his game taken away. We began to laugh @CAPS5 our dad looked over @CAPS5 scolded us, then looked back at the @LOCATION1. Then out of nowhere @CAPS15 said ""I found them.""

We watched him. @CAPS15 looked at the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 reached his hand into the bag of dog treats @CAPS5 pulled one out. @CAPS15 looked at us @CAPS5 we looked away momentarilly.

35, " Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, I actually had that experience. It was a @DATE1 @TIME2 @PERSON1 we had just gotten off of the bus. I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus @PERSON1 headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots @PERSON1 went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends @PERSON1, @PERSON1 all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, @PERSON1 the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a @TIME1. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE1 @TIME1. so I talked to my friends @PERSON1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from @TIME1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I luckily was not hurt, I could have been seriously injured."
40, "            @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well, I believe that it is true. It's more convenent to be happy than being sad. According to me.  In @DATE2, my family was living in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE1... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS13 excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS6 opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON1 walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, ""@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1."" @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,""That's gross @CAPS2!"" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever! I watched it on the @CAPS11 video.  We @MONTH1 put that video on the ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12."" @CAPS13 if you see it, just remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 remember, you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be mad. Laughter, is the key to a happy life!"
34, "            The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones."
36, "                                        The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of ones relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest of wanting to be someones friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH1 get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in @DATE1 of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 I do? What @CAPS2 she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH1 become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl"". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH1 be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS2 I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH1 be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS2 I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS1 to have it."
32, "Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH1 have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH1 not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS1 job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness."
44, " A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS1 luck."" @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. ""@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!"" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again."
40, "Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49."
31, " A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl."
36, "Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people."
45, " When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference."
40, "                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."
42, " Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh."
42, " ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice."
31, "                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. "
36, " People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing."
40, " One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before."
40, " My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends."
25, " My newest botfriend and i have been dateing for well almost @NUM1 months on @DATE1 it will be a year. We have a lot of fun together we talk about anything we dont rreally ride bikes or go jogging we have just started to work out togther. My parents love him they call him there son in law i think its kinda cute.. but anyways we had a blast on new years eve and we were hanging out with one of joes friends his name is randy we were doing the normal thing hanging out bbqs everything. It was around like @TIME1 and we were ready to go to bed well randy had no idea that we were going to stay the night we nither did i but we did.. Randy owns a hotel place out by grayback they had no extra beds in there house so we asked randy if we could use a hotel room he said yeah of coures. The @TIME1 day we had to pay him a little bit of money not all of it yet but some of it and we went to our hotel room.  Me and @CAPS1 were looking at it and it had a big hot tube bath bed king size bed i jumped on it and it was the best. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on a pair of shorts and i @CAPS2 my bathing suit on we @CAPS2 inside the hot tube and had a blast :) well when i was trying to get out of the hot tube i slipped and i caught myself iam so glad that i did not fall on my face then @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out and did the same thing it was kinda funny but not really but at the same time it was. Me and @CAPS1 were really hungry and all we had was a bag of chips and some cheese dip when @CAPS1 was eating the chip he was making this funny noise like the star wars person chubaka . it was the best time ever we @CAPS2 to watch sadalight t.v. i dont have that at my house so all we have to watch is dvds and maybe some vhs's but anyways we brought the @NUM2 with us. We were in the room playing this game called metal of honor it is kinda like a war game but with lots of gun we kinda had the t.v. up but i did not think it was that loud i guess the nehbordid. After about @NUM3 to @NUM4 mintues we heard a knock on the door it was the nehbor he was asking if everything was ok cause he heard loud noises and gun shots coming from the room we said yeah of course everything is ok it is just a game that we have for the playstation sorry to bother sir i did not think it was that loud. So we did turn the t.v. down and we played the game for like @NUM5 hours so by the time we went to bed it was lik @NUM6 the @TIME1 moring i was so tired that @TIME1 day and i had to go to school that very @TIME1 day. We @CAPS2 up took a shower and whent back into randy's house we sat in there had breakfast I think we had bicuts and gravy it was the best I had a lot of fun then.

But i think we will @CAPS1 has treated me so well and i appreciate him and what he does for me. He also has been one of the best friends i have ever and hopefully we will betogether for a long time."
40, "The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2. "
27, "                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea."
36, " I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key."
37, "Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS1. Her name was @CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON1. He is @NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON2 spent the @TIME1 at @PERSON1 house the @TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS3 bring my friends and I together."
42, " One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better."
43, "Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1."
30, " It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and i enjoyed my party."
38, "@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you." @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world."
47, " When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget."
36, "  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS1 gave me up for adaption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, @CAPS1 wasn't ready @CAPS8 be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS4 her. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS2 we were at @PERSON1's house in the @DATE1 or @DATE2 we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON1 @CAPS3 her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away, @PERSON1 and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS4 @PERSON2. That when we saw each other @CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS8 my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON1 and I got the chance @CAPS8 talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS8.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS4 @PERSON2 an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS8 go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS6 was then that i relized @PERSON1 had tought me something else @CAPS8 appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS4 sorrow. @CAPS8 rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS8 have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS8 everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS6 credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS4 me."
42, "Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? "". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done. We are true friends."
35, " Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."
34, " One day is was almost @CAPS1 and my sister, my mom, and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. Once my mom left my sister and I were still busy working away in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Finally she was done with making the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms ( little lemon glazed cakes). The directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice. @CAPS4 i told my sister to get the lemon juice out of the lemons. At this point in time I am making the little cakes, my sister yells at me and asks "" do I just squeeze @CAPS3?"" and I thinking she cut @CAPS3 says yes. Well I was wrong my sister yells at me again and says "" @CAPS3 isn't working."" @CAPS4 i turn around to find her squeezing an un-cut lemon trying to get the lemon juice out of @CAPS3 I just looked at her told her she needed to cut @CAPS3 and started laughing. I don't think I have ever laughed that hard. As I am on the floor crying because I am laughing @CAPS4 hard my mom comes into the kitchen with a bag full of grocery's and the first words out of her mouth were "" @CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do."" @CAPS7 if you can believe @CAPS3 i started laughing even harder. Also my sister to this day is still called lemons. This is because my family and I thought @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 funny that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience i have learned that laughing is important in @CAPS4 many ways, @CAPS3 can bring friends and family closer together, @CAPS3 can make any relationship stronger. This experience in the end made my sister and I a lot closer in many ways and now we always laugh together and I would rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I since this incident have become @CAPS4 much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should laugh because you might not know that laughing over the stupidest thing could make any relationship better and make the two people closer. @CAPS4 live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh could help you become friends with someone or bring you and someone closer than ever."
42, " Many people think that @ORGANIZATION1 is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION1. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS3 we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION1 is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!"
40, "Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did."
45, " Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love."
36, " Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it"""
36, "@CAPS1 do @CAPS2 know were my wax for my skin board is? I yelled to my @CAPS1 as i walked out of my room."I think it is on @CAPS8 book shelve but why do @CAPS2 need it?" my father replied.It's for @PERSON1's birthday present, I don't @CAPS4 any money for him and i promised him something amazing this year so i am going to take him to @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and we are going to ride are canoe down the giant sand dune.why cant @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree? my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying @CAPS8 the stupidest kid i know.@CAPS2 know i don't take handouts @CAPS1 i would @CAPS4 to work for that money and i don't @CAPS4 enough time to work for it and hangout with @PERSON1 all day, I mean it is his birthday after all and besides this is more fun I said with a mischievous grin on my face.Well alright the canoe is already hooked up to the truck, my @CAPS1 replied.That's fine with me pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back? I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS2 here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS8 taking me on today he asked? @CAPS2 will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS8 living room watching the @ORGANIZATION1 win there game when @CAPS8 done. So leaving @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 to change I waited outside @PERSON1's room. Alright, said @PERSON3 we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON1 yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS1 was still waiting. So @PERSON1 said to my @CAPS1 as he got into the back seat do @CAPS2 know what @CAPS8 son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS2 going fishing @PERSON1? @PERSON3 asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON1. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON1's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON2. Turning into @PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS1 saying I don't think @CAPS2 will want me to @CAPS4 these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank. As we reached the other bank we all jumped out and i pulled the canoe up onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand duneWe are going to push this up the dune then wax the bottom and ride down the hill in it i said smiling madly at them bothYour stupid the commented together but were down they sad starting to push the canoe up the hill. As we reached the top we flipped the canoe over and started hurriedly waxed the bottom, then pushed it to a likely spot to slide down and all jumped in we slide forward a little but stoped. Without another word me and @PERSON3 jumped out and pushed with while running then jumping in we flew on down the sand dune and hit the water with a thud snapping the canoe in two as it flipped me out to a log ten yards away as i saw @PERSON3 fly out and hit the water with a cannon ball as @PERSON1 just fell out the side into the shallows. When i emerged i heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank."@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9' "
32, " There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood."
43, " When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS3,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out."
35, " Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""  "
40, " I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!"
39, " My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer."
35, "                                   Laughter. Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship. I once knew someone that had a great relationship becuse of laughter. They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal."
40, "                               Sound @CAPS1  @CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. @CAPS2 the funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?"" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  ""That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!"" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, ""@CAPS6 the heck was that?""  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3's expression of, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?"" That's @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song ""@CAPS11"" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes...""  ""@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own."" @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15"" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1."
35, "                                  How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said,""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said,""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS3 was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS3. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS3 was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS3.  I thank @CAPS4 that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS3's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS1 is. Laughing at @CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @CAPS1 around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day."
35, " In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End."
38, " Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me."
37, " Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter @CAPS2 a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION1 my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS2 one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our ""uncle-nephew"" relationship into a friend relationship. My life is full of laughter and will be full of laughter for my life because of one person."
36, " There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.""That's my dog."" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far."
40, " @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."
31, " It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school."
42, "Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"
40, " Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have became so close in the last @NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season."
42, " Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along."
40, "                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."
40, "  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in."
40, " Laughter is the best way to bring people closer together. It creates a bond that makes you feel a little more comfortable and secure. Life would be sad and depressing if there was no such thing as laughter. Everyone has a different type of laugh some peoples are loud, quiet,weird, or funny.But our laughter is what makes us who we are.  There are so many effects in the process of laughing.Your laugh can have such a strong effect on your body that it can cause your eyes to become a little teary. Sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt. When somethings really funny I usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing.That's one of the effects that happens to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke,or even a simple mistake.My family always makes me laugh.When we have party's were always laughing and cracking up jokes.One of the jokes that my cousins said is that my aunts baby was so white that it look like a came out of la lechera. Lechera is a @CAPS1 word.  Another thing that also made me laugh is when i went to my cousins house. We were watching a movie and i had to go use the restroom so i went and when i came out she jump out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing i was scared but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere and i never expected her to do that. I think of laughing as a gift. It is something that can always brighten our day.I love to laugh and there's so many unforgettable moments were i almost laughed till i peed my pants.I think the people with the best personality are the people who can make someone else laugh."
40, "                                        Laughter: The @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine! "
37, " High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophmore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer. It wasn't like we made enemys with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully.  The @DATE1 going into my junior year i had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make-up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologise first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON1 anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might of moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good-bye to her. Lunch had past and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled there walked in @LOCATION1. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one sceond I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face bacame serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apoligise first, beacause I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsiblitie for what I had done to her.  One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON1. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e-mail. It would have been better to have aid it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e-mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presents around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways.  During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON1 came out of no where and sat next to me. She smiled and said ""remember when you tripped in the @NUM1 grade?"" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down face face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friends back. And the laughs can go on again."
37, " Laughter is a Element of @CAPS1  Laughter is a huge element of @CAPS1, without laughter @CAPS1 wouldn't be what it is today. Laughing is actually a element of why I am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now. I also believe ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" Someone once said. Laughter also breaks the ice with people either when their mad, sad, or just meeting the person. Also laughter can bring two people very close together. Here is a true story about how laughter is a element of @CAPS1. One day while I was with my best friend @PERSON1, we met up with her cousin @CAPS2 friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. This is no love story but he making me laugh broke the wall I had put up because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together the more closer i felt to him and comfortable I was around him. Eventually we started dating. Too this day we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of laughter, if it wasn't for the laughter @PERSON2 and I would not be as close as we are now. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that because laughter gives you that feeling of security, like the sense that it is okay to be your self around strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun. Makes you feel like at this moment your bonding with this person. It doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when using laughter for the right reason, for example breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone that can bring them closer. Breaking the ice with laughter. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people making conversation and laughing could do that trick to make them feel not so shy and set back to talking. When I first meet people I am very shy until someone makes me laugh then I am very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone. But laughter could always push you away from someone. When I was upset about me and my ex fiance breaking up for the first time after year and a half no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @PERSON1 brought me out to the state fair, being on the rides and laughing with her, brought her and I closer also I was not mad anymore. She broke that anger and hurt inside of me just by laughing. A huge element of @CAPS1 is laughter, there is no doubt about that. Depending on the persons perspective laughing @MONTH1 not be a element of @CAPS1 to them but to me it is. With out the feeling of security when laughing with @PERSON2 we wouldn't be as close as we are now. With out laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we are together. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Someone once said. @CAPS1 would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter. "
45, " It has been said that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul."" I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it truly does ignite a spark. And once that spark has been ignited watch out, it will burn like a wild fire. As the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the the body. First its that uncontrollably smile that brings an ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that marvelously flutters through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least the tears of joy come streaming from your eyes. Had these feelings before? That'@CAPS5 the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn.  Laughter is an extraordinary thing--it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter I wasn't the one laughing...About three weeks ago while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS1, and I went to visit my grandparents and to see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending sometime at their house it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS2. My grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then I mentioned that @CAPS1 and I could go do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpas @LOCATION1, everything seemed fine; just another ordinary day. After we had arrived at the gymnastics center we headed inside and waited for @PERSON1 to finish. However, as we were walking out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward--when all of the sudden I heard a loud crunch! My heart dropped as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building.  Now before I go on I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very good driver. But hey, that first crash happens to all of us, right? Well back to my story, as I was driving back to my grandparents house it took everything I had not to cry. After we arrived back at their house @CAPS1 and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5. pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the the building was gone. The dent didn't look so bad once the paint was gone and the truck was back to white. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour I finally got up the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes and we went out to look at the damage. As I started crying because I felt so bad, my grandpa just started laughing and reminding me that it was just a truck and it can be fixed.The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime. So no matter if you're laughing about something that makes you happy or a situation that maybe isn't so good, let the fire burn."
32, "  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said ""hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods"" ""sure why not"" we all said ""we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say ""there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous ""alright"" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes ""sorry"" we both said"" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly"" i said with animosity. ""@CAPS5 what is it"" @PERSON3 said ""don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean"" said @PERSON1 "" ""oh daaanngg"" @PERSON2 said ""i think were gonna die if we got back over there"" @CAPS1 complained. ""@CAPS7 gonna be just fine"" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there""I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said ""lets go see what is in that tree"" ""im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS13 up"" he said ""that wasn't me it was @PERSON1"" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life. "
30, "  One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat.  The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice.   About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together."
41, " Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END "
44, " Bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hill tops as the waking sun began to rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air arose the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their mellifluous tone of song. Gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator @MONTH1 agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one is to catch a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON1 stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON1's teary eyes and wet face began to dry. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, a long lost memory interrupted @PERSON1's thought for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice.  ""@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE1, and six-year-old @PERSON1 came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky stair case and skipped to his parent's room. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3?"" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass door knob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the mid-wife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. ""@CAPS4 hello to your new baby sister,""said @PERSON1's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON1 began to place the tip of his @CAPS7 light-up sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. ""@CAPS5 was born less that an hour ago,"" said his father. @PERSON1 then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch-by-inch, he slowly began to peal back the top blanket; but, before @PERSON1 could even finish this task, the new-born baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON1's reaction, but was careful no to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide-eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON1's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her moth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in a hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 began to relax and smiled at this mother. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?"" @CAPS5 asked. His father chimed in, I would think so!"" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the mid-wife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father.  @PERSON1 could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS5 could of won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS5 didn't. Now @CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS7 then, @PERSON1 suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; however, the memories made and laughter shared still continues to engulf @PERSON1 with his mother's love.   In my mind, @PERSON1 is classified as a superior individual. As I am his only full sister, he never fails to educate me of his past memories with our mother. I love her and miss her, but know I will see her again someday; and when I do, we will be bound together with joy and laughter. "
30, "                             laughter      why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh?Is laughter a healthy thing you should have in your health chart?This are some questions you might    ask yourself.But when you do have you thought of yourself, and maby have you thought of how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or maby the family room anywere as long as you hear laughter coming out of your mouth.It doesn't matter an what you laugh about, it can be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or a funny commercial. it doesnt matter as long as you laugh.in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life.if you dont laugh then you must be a very seriouse person or you might even think that the world is a very boring place to be in.some how i cant really imagine a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people that dont really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just doesnt have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood.I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother an i to quiet sown whaen we would talk in the family table during dinner one day. One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments. So when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said ok and we tried it .It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table. It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting.Like i told you in the first paragraph theres many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comody show i very good idea would be @PERSON1 that show always mekes me crack up sometimes my mom thinks im crazy. Or ever family @CAPS1 thats such a great show to watch wene your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes theres the knock knock shows and then theres the guess what i am jokes . but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tikling that always works theres no way you cant ever make someone laugh. Eather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a @CAPS2 see who laughs first contest.It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while. I heard tha t if you laugh alot suposlly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems."
38, " Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS2 I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON2. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""@CAPS1 here!"" or ""@CAPS2 way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS2 game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS2 race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me."
36, " Folded In @DATE1 it was right around @DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM1 lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.    "
33, "  I was in @NUM1 grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well @NUM2 days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole @DATE1, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the @DATE2 class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my @NUM3 top favorite memories and moments of any school year. True Story."
30, "My story about laughter is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors. I love to play sports always have, always will. Iv been playing football for about @NUM1 years now and iv never been hurt, except one pracitce. It was in @NUM2 grade. My football team always does one hitting drill once a week. The drill is called truck and trailer. Its where you have @NUM3 people. Two people on offence and two peole on defense. The two people on offence are trying to score and the two people on defence are trying to stop them. Of course I get stuck with running the ball and not to mention the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. This kid couldn't do anything on the football field other then keep the bench warm. The two biggest and best hitters were on defence trying to kill me. I knew that this was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so i do. My coach (my dad) hikes the ball and I take off. Soon enough they catch up with me and take me off my feet. One went high and the other went low. I hit the ground and stayed down. I hear my teammates start screaming. I thought it was because i got ''cracked"". I thought wrong. I sit up and my knee kinda hurts. I look at it and it looks like rubber. My leg was pointing the opposite way that it's supposed to go. Iv only seen a brake like that on tv and youtube. My dad doesnt hesitate too call @NUM4. The ambulance came to the field @NUM5 minutes later. They came down to the field and put my on a strecher. My team wasnt the only team that used that field. About @NUM5 other teams practiced at the same time. All eyes were on me. And on my leg. The other teams didnt know what happened except that they had a big ice back on my private area. All my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was embarrasing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg they still woud make fun of me. I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasnt fun for me and especially not funny. But all my friends thought it was hilasious."
26, " They say that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I agree completely. You can't be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them. It makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be more difficult to have.  I have a bestfriend and her names @CAPS1. We were bestfriends ever since the day we found out we had the same birthday. But to us, that meant we were twin sisters."
34, "  About @NUM1 years ago, my best friend @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I were having a sleep over at her house. We were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball. We had been jumping, standing, flipping, @CAPS6 everything you could think of but trying to do that with out falling off of it! @LOCATION1 went to go do this flip on to the ball @CAPS6 she said "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watch this cool thing I just did!"" @CAPS3 she try's to do the same thing she did, but she messes up, @CAPS6 the giant ball went flying out from under her! We started laughing @CAPS3 hard! It was @CAPS3 funny that she almost peed her pants! But then her older sister came in, @CAPS6 that's when it all started... @PERSON1, (@LOCATION1's older sister) was always much bigger than us @CAPS3 we did @CAPS8 she said no matter @CAPS8. As soon as she walked in we stopped @CAPS8 we were doing! She said that she wanted to play a game with us, @CAPS3 we decided to play too. @PERSON1 told us to get on the bed @CAPS6 go under the blankets. @CAPS3 we did @CAPS6 right when we did the light shut off! @CAPS6 the door slammed shut! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not @CAPS3 we didn't say a word.  The next thing you know, the door barley creeks open @CAPS6 you can see a little bit of light through the crack. She was back, @CAPS6 with supplies! It was silent for about @NUM2 minutes, then @LOCATION1 starts screaming! Right when I look over @LOCATION1 is getting dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I'm trying to bring her back up I feel someone grabbing my feet! There I go, right where @LOCATION1 is! We kept trying to hide,@CAPS6 get back up on the bed, but we eventually gave up because our plan didn't work that well. All of a sudden my feet were tied together! Then my hands @CAPS6 mouth! @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room @CAPS6 hitting us, she thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world! She was laughing @CAPS3 hard, especially when we kept trying to get back on the bed with tied hands @CAPS6 feet.  After an hour of struggling me @CAPS6 @LOCATION1 had an idea! We thought if we hid in the bathroom she couldn't get us anymore @CAPS6 we would try to un-tie each others bandannas @CAPS6 ropes. But before we could do that @PERSON1 beat us to it! She had thrown us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. ""@LOCATION1 @CAPS8 is that noise? "" I said. ""@CAPS4 the bath!"" she said. We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON1 picked us up @CAPS6 threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming yelling for each other. @CAPS6 for help!   When we got out of the bathtub she threw us back up on the bed @CAPS6 finally untied our bandannas @CAPS6 ropes! After she turned the light back on we looked at our wrists @CAPS6 ankles @CAPS6 there was red marks all over them. @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS5! Your crazy, we told you to stop @CAPS6 you didn't!"" @CAPS6 right after she screamed that @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walks in. ""@CAPS8 is all the yelling for girls?"" @CAPS6 then it all came out! In the end @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble @CAPS6 we got out of it. @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I learned a huge lesson. Never ""play a game"" with your older sister when she has bandannas @CAPS6 ropes!"
32, "Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."
32, " It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?""""@CAPS2"" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face.""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny"" I demanded throwing a smile back at him.""@CAPS2 is funny, but.."" @CAPS6 paused for a moment.""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to my self. ""@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap.""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time.""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out.""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS12 I just walk away?"".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!.""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9"" I said feeling relived.""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1"" I asked noticing his not @CAPS14 happy expression. ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out"" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready"" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. ""@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?"" @CAPS6 grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend"" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. @CAPS14 i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS1 was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it. "
31, "Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it. "
41, "Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS1 feel good, @CAPS1 feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  ""@CAPS1 don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out.""I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS1 are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS1 want to do? I don't think @CAPS1 would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS1 would want your friends or family make @CAPS1 laugh, so @CAPS1 can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS2 fine, @CAPS4 I @CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, ""@CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes @CAPS1 feel way better in the end."" I mean, @CAPS1 @MONTH1 feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS1 can @CAPS2 laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS2 be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS1 have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS1 can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS3 sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde."" @CAPS3 says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  ""@CAPS4 @CAPS1 laugh a lot. @CAPS1 will live life longer.""I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS1 can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter."
46, "Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. ""@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: ""@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS3 suggested. ""@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter."
35, " One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so then he put it back. Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me.  He said to me ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro"" I answered back. ""@CAPS1 you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat."" said the guy. "" @CAPS2 dude I did not take a hat"" I replied. ""@CAPS3.k. then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop.  ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is @CAPS2 reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it."
50, " All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun."
40, " @CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?"
40, " When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in."
40, "The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over."
41, " Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy."
36, " Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through."
41, " When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3."
30, "     In order to to laugh you have to be happy. I was once happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I've made me more dissapointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful babygirl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has effected me and my family. Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS1 over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority and when i get out I gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now.   In the @DATE1 I would have never guessed that I'd be here where I'm at now but when I get home I'm gonna put a smile on my brothers face and my parents and when I see my girl I'm gonna go give her the biggest smoochie boo kiss of her life so she'll cry and laugh."
40, " Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, ""@CAPS2're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."
50, " Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion."
37, " We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh."
30, " Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry.There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes @CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in the own way. The world never be as one, their will always be war all the time forever on earth."
32, "One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. "
33, " I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.  The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends,family,or a significant other."
36, "            Just One @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the @DATE1 of us, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1 and I, walk under the cover of the trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a chat. @LOCATION1, who is six foot @DATE1, has long raven-black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, plopped down in the wet green grass. But @PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about @DATE1 paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. @PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON2's feeling that way made @LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS5 teletubies, went to @PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about @DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking @CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS6-@CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS6-@CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and @PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine."
42, " Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS4 know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS4 help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on."
25, "@NUM1)I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. he wasn't that high levelin his company. @CAPS2 he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh.One day, the boss of company came to his company and asked everyone " who doingwork hardest?" @CAPS2 nobody didn't answer that question. then the boss said "or recommendsomeone for promote level" and then everyone recommended that business man. Becausehe always say hello to everyone with big laugh. and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss. what I'm trying to say is the laugh make people happier. and when i was with my friends,laugh was make us more friendly. also laugh is good for health too. If you laugh a lotyour life is getting way more longer than before. of course it is good for mind too.that business man wasn't very good worker. He just made everyone happier to his laugh.that's why he could be a highest level of the company.I think laugh is really good for everything. and I also laugh a lot. I want people make happier."
42, " I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through."" @PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS11!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.  "
32, "  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter."
36, "Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol."
41, " When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleas-er. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of loosing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my @CAPS1 count, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Anything from rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry which students thought was funny, and occasionally destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me. As I advanced into high school I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately loose my funny, humorous personality. I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a father level of being unhappy. That so called ""@CAPS1"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someones @CAPS1 who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her, it was just to hard for me. When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing!"
22, in @NUM1 grade to @NUM2 grade was the happy time of my life. i had a teacher name @PERSON1. she love mickey mouse. i wish that sometime can go back there. in @NUM1 grade i was to the class room i know my of friends was with but did know the teacher. i didn't know what think of her at the @CAPS1 but i know have to get know her because she was my teacher for @NUM4 years. at one of my meeting my p.e. teacher teach me how to try my shoes.everyday we in ours journal we have did to tell a story about something i all ways talk about @PERSON2 and she will all ways tell me don't writer about her tell something new.in @NUM1 grade. my class and i we got to coffer shop for a frip trip. in @NUM6 my class read over @NUM7 book we have a party. sometime in the @DATE1 time we all get together and we will have a ice cream party. when @DATE2 come around we all ways do a musical every years. in @NUM8 i when to outdoor school it was fun and cool. 
50, "  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart."
37, " Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life."
36, " To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS3 or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS1 mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS3 things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS1 boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS1 credit card account was being help for @NUM1 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME1 when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS2 and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""@CAPS3 vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS1 bank and see what was going on with @CAPS1 account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS1 pin number to access @CAPS1 account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS1 account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS1 stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness."
37, "                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.     "
46, " Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."
50, "   @LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my @CAPS1 @CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS7 or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.     Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter.  @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy."
35, " My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!"
45, " Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."
31, " I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS3 I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE1 @TIME1. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS1 versus and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON1,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS3 so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever."
33, " Laughter is the best medicine for a friend in pain. My friend @CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while I waited for him I decided to ride my bike. I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how i felt, but it didn't hurt any more. I got better because laughter is the best medicine."
25, " The elements of laughter is to show emotion to other to let them know that you had a great time or to show that there are special. Laughter is some times in me. I laught when I have a great time. The greates laughter I always have is with friends saying crazy thing when we go to the bus after school. That the joy from friend and you to reales the tens strees from school. I always go home with a smile. Theres always jokes to tell to have joy. When the bell rings with in the end of my last class, I am tierd from working hard. When I go to my bus located on the front of the school. I feel strees out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a great time. I comepletely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and rediculace story we say. When we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me. This prosses has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be ower last ride from the bus @NUM1 my favorite number. I hope we will still have the great time."
42, " Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."
40, " My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON2. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, ""@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do."
46, " The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."
45, "Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling."
34, " It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!"
35, " Hello my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS11 i am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences i have ever had. It is a story about me @CAPS11 my friends @CAPS11 a little adventure we had @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE1 air, @CAPS11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS11 meet up with his cousin ""@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by."" @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS11 looked an @PERSON1 @CAPS11 said ""lets go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS11 food @CAPS11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE1 loop @CAPS11 @CAPS10 what happened. ""@CAPS5 it is"" yelled @CAPS2 ""@CAPS5's the park i found it."" We looked off in the distance @CAPS11 @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS3 had @CAPS7 so @CAPS3 called them @CAPS11 had them come @CAPS11 unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS11 a half to find us @CAPS11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousins house @CAPS11 stayed @CAPS5 for the @TIME1. When we got @CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @CAPS11 warm clothes, ""looks like you guys have had a rough one"" @CAPS3 said, ""I'm @PERSON2, I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now."" @CAPS8 we changed in to the clothes @PERSON2 had given us we went @CAPS11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS5 @CAPS11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said ""i wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""we can"" @PERSON2 said, ""i know the perfect place."" @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house, @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS10, told you i had the perfect spot."" @CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS11 on through the @TIME1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, @CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends."
30, "I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important."
33, " Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to."
44, " Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS1 as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS3's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS2 her house. When @LOCATION1 and I stepped in my house @CAPS3 was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS2 the sight of my step dad, @PERSON1 yelling @CAPS2 my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. ""I can't believe @CAPS1 just can't go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS1 would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,"" @PERSON1 said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS1 can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION1 had said, ""@CAPS1 don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS1 could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!"" @CAPS2 that point @CAPS3 was no going back @CAPS2 what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON1 began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS6 said some words that @CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS6 began to stutter. @CAPS6 spoke, ""@CAPS3 was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION1 wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON2's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand."" @CAPS3 was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS6 was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS6 immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS6 didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS6 couldn't take it away. @CAPS6 wanted possession of it so @CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS6 take away her phone, but @CAPS6 took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION1 and I continued laughing @CAPS6 ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS6 could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS3 was. Sad part was @CAPS6 even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS3 was nothing to say. @CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS6 had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but i had put the story as my status on @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 had saw. I didn't mention any names besides @LOCATION1 and I's, but the fact @CAPS6 knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry.  @PERSON1 began to wonder. My sister had said @CAPS3 was no toilet paper and when @CAPS6 asked if @CAPS3 was napkins she also said, ""no."" @CAPS6 started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. @CAPS6 was so mad, but @CAPS2 the same time laughing really hard. @CAPS6 felt like @CAPS6 should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step dad, @PERSON1 still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @CAPS6 said, ""@CAPS1 @MONTH1 think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when @CAPS1 don't have any toilet paper."""
