16, "Tick, tock, tick, tock. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. I’m not a very patient person. I’ll tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) One time me my mom and my sister we went to the docter because my sister had a docters appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient."
18, One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ‘A’ team and the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team I was still happy I didn’t get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.
24, "A time that I was patient was last year at cheer competition. In the beginning of the day I was patient getting in line to get ready to perform. Once we were ready we were waiting to go to perform. After, we perfomed we went to watch the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good. Then are team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. We had to wait til all the teams were done. Once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members were waiting patiently to see if we worn in cheer or in dance. We waited… and waited… and waited till finally he called are name. The junior varsity cheer leader! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day for me and I was very patient and being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. You never now till it happens. That is a time when I was patient at cheer competition."
16, One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.
9, Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients.

13, A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He kept doing dump stuff like pulling the curtins down or playing with the stove. I wanted to hit him. I didn’t hit him because he was just being bad.
12, The time I was patient was when I was wait on my mom to have her @CAPS2. The reason why is becaus she was being a pain to me. She was mean and every thing. So I was lik oh my @CAPS1 she need to have this @CAPS2 so all this can be over and done with. This was when she was oly @NUM1 months so I know that I had to be so patient with her antill the @NUM2 months was over.
14, "Patience is about waiting for something for a long  time. If you have patience that is good for you here is a time where i had patience. Last year in @DATE1 after school my dad and I went hunting for deer in @CAPS1. He went to this homeguards blind that we found sat in chair waiting for a deer to come along. You have to have patience while going  hunting . We didn’t see anything but then a deer came along and my dad he got ready and he said “cover your ear” then he shot  but we didn’t see any sign of deer blood  so he must have missed,then we packed up and went home.That is the time i had patience to go hunting with my dad but we didn’t get anything though."
14, "One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 was a @CAPS5 long line and I'm usually saying ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" @CAPS8, I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line. I was proud of my self and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient."
12, One day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patient cause we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours when that time past we all went to get our spots and before we had did that there was this long line again but even longer but it was ok cause I had patients. With all this patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctors office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in his waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept on interrupting her and I told her you need to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone so she ran up the stair and she said your stupid punk so I said I don’t care.
8, I am all way patient wen I hunt and fish. I always go hunting I find a spot and setor clmeit in a tree. I waet for along time for deer and trukey and @CAPS1. Some times you don’t see anything at all. The key is get out early and be patient. The most of the time I usely see @NUM1 deer wen its deer sesson wen I go out . How I see them alot is being patient a lot.

So again he didn’t listen to me so I told @PERSON2, alex did not stop yet so I said nothing and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1. Talks a lot and @PERSON1. And eventually it did work and alex finally stoped. So I was happy. But he (alex) started again so I told him to stop on I would tell the teacher again. So he just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on doing all of the stupid noises. So I told the teachers and said alex you better stop this instinse. So alex you better stoped and began resibling with his pencil all over his peace of paper."
11, "Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my @CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for a conference. Can you please find my suit.

18, "“Time to go outside!”the teacher said happy that @CAPS2 would get a breake soon. All the kids rall outside to @NUM1 come play with us were playing jump rope!” one of the girls said sweetly as @CAPS2 swung the jump rope around, the little girl smacked he little flat shoes on the cement just light enough for  @PERSON1 to her.”I’m waiting”said the little girl un-patiently.”@CAPS1 on.”@CAPS2 said with an upset tone!”fine!”the little girl said as @CAPS2 crossed aims and swayed  bark and forth. One of the love came upto @PERSON1 to! @PERSON1 do want to play tag, or hide and seek.”@CAPS3,”@CAPS2 said sweetly with he arims folded nicely in he lap as @CAPS2 ran away waving his arms around. @PERSON1 laughed at him and then thought @CAPS4 I play with him then my other friend will be mad. But @CAPS2 was being mean to! The little boy particularly waiting for @ORGANIZATION1’s mind to be made up hopped about like a bunny trying to make her laugh again. ”@PERSON1!!!The little girl said and jumping up and down, making her little. plastic shoes as they hit the ground.”I don’t have to play with @NUM2 said ,”but I am your best friend.”@CAPS2 said getting a fare that only her mom would fogive.”@CAPS6 eyes don’t work on me! @PERSON1 said “fine! ”@CAPS2 said again and the lit he girl ran off”I can play with you know”@CAPS2 said”@CAPS7 lets play tag?”@CAPS2 said laughing then @NUM3 said.Thanks for playing with me,”the little boy said."
9, I will tell you about when I was patience. For a long time it was hope you will read. I was going to @LOCATION1 to go quisney world .It to ke forever! It toke  three days of driving. We play game like I spy or game boy. We very rare toke break for peeing or eating. I will didn’t lik the trip. But when we finally got there it was worth it. We had some fun.
17, "One day I was at home and I was getting ready to go and to eat and there was a very long  line so I was on the phone with @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 we were talking about the @CAPS1 test so then I said @CAPS2 why is this taking forever so they told me to be patient and until it’s time to order, so I said what does patient means they said it means to understand and be tolerant and do not complain so I said I might try that and then before I knew it I was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at red hobster. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines all I have to do is be a lot more patient and dont complaine."
18, "One day when I was home alone I felt nobody was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my and parents went to go visit him. I was very scared and I felt @CAPS1 had left me. So I prayed and prayed but I fell or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep and I heard @CAPS2 voice, he was talking to me! I was running in a field will grass. I saw a man dressed in where dating walking through and, and when he came out of the mud there was no sitting or did anymore on him. I ran up to him and asked “man who are you?” he replied and said” little child of @CAPS1 why do you look so lonely? I am your angel one I have come to tell you what your father has said,” he talked to me for a long time, and I did not feel scared or lonely anymore, there was one cloud in the sky, he said he had to go but that he was my gurdian angle. After that he rose into the deol. I will never forget him, he is my angle. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear @CAPS4 voice."

7, To me when some one is being patient they are in line or waiting for something and they're being very calm. Where they aren't rushed and are very quiet.
17, "My brothers checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for @NUM1, there was nothing I could do @CAPS1 I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a near car magazine and started flipping through it, @CAPS1 the interesting thing was a article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @NUM2 I went to the bathroom, and really soon was back in the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple people. Five minutes passed and answer no I close my eyes and layed my head back so I waited and waited. Right when I was about bash my head on a brick wall my brother enters the room and says “ That’s it “.And then I got a text by two people, it would have been better while I was board out of my mind!"
11, "The time  I was patience was when I snowbling with my family .Because my dad and I h ave to get them wormed and get them  off the trailar and start them  and he has to ride one around and get us a track and  I ride be hind him on the other sled and I muc to get the snow geon on and that is not ,we go to my aunt and house in @LOCATION1 ,I’ve been to a lot of places on the sleds ."
12, "One time I got sent to my room, also I have sit on my bed and I could @CAPS1 do eny thing. I ask one time to get out and he aded more time. So forl about an hour and a half I has to sit in my room. I took a nap for about twenty minits. I was so bord and then he finily let meat."
12, "Once, I was @NUM1 old and I was so eager about getting a new bike I didn't have no patience at all, so that day I asked my dad can I get a new bike ""he said not now"" ""I said pleaseee"" he said later then, after that day my dad was getting dressed  I said yes!! That's for my bike so. I went to my dad and I told him I'm ready ""he said what"" were are you going I said with you then he said no not now, I got so angry and went and sat down. After an hour has been gone my dad showed up, so I ran so fast and said can we go now he said ali be patient, I said why you said we are going to go, so my dad parked the car and went downstairs and ate lunch. So I started to get angry I went to the couch and sat their and watched @CAPS1 while my dad was eating. After he was done he said ali lets go!! I said where, to? buy you a bike I ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed. After I got my new bike and I was patient."
20, "Patient ; When arriving to ceader point their was one ride it wated  to go on, that is the @CAPS1. The only problem is that it is a @NUM1 hour wait. Standing there in the blazing hot sun on @NUM2 @CAPS2  days I was  having second thoughts. Looking up and seeing the light and @CAPS3 difficult shades of green truck if the??? I knew it was worth it. After @NUM3 minutes @PERSON1 my brother was all ready board. So we played @NUM4 @CAPS4 to pass the time. I wore every time. Almost an hour later we get to the first pop and struck mageen. I get three pop and about @NUM5 cany bars @PERSON1 got double the around of me. Two hours later we got to the elevator was mouse bring us up it the??? At the top they strap us in to the frount row seat!  What our luck. Crank! Crank! Crank! Went the roller as to slowly truged up the hill. Then own cart dipled down and we were @CAPS2 going @NUM5 miles per hour we whent up, down, side, to side, me up site down??? three minutes. When we final pulled back into the station @PERSON1 had puched @NUM1 times and??? Meating my group back the car we began the @NUM8 hour car ride home and I turned to my brother and said it is another, so own game of @NUM4 @CAPS5 began."
8, "Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to gett were they are going. Like checking out at a store or at work, some people can be rood and not use their patience at school and work you should always use your patience, like for an example, use my patience at kinchat school because there are over one handred @NUM1, graders, and half of them are bushy when its lunch time and the other half gets hurt and they @CAPS1 don’t know what to do."
18, "Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didn’t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, “@CAPS1 do you want!” @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way."
23, "One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was @CAPS1. One time my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get the air port and go to @CAPS2 world @CAPS4 we packed to car we drove to the airport. In the car my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport we got supper excited! When we got to the area were you wait for your plane the workers told every one waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait, we walked around the air port and, and got something to eat. Then @CAPS4 that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just set down and talked and before we knew it we were  getting on the plane. Being patient can really help the soutition."
17, "On @DATE1 it was my birthday I was just turning @NUM1. I was so happy!!! Well while I was being happy and my big sisters were getting thing together for my party my mom was at work. We had everything at the party thing such as juice, pop, food, candy, chips, icecream, but no cake. My mom was suppose to pick it up when she got of work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and icecream. We had the icecream but no cake, but I didn’t cry and scream like a baby, my sister did but she was still @NUM2 and I was @NUM1 and I had to act as a @NUM1 year old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she get my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was @NUM1!"
15, "One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in ann- @CAPS1  and the was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow."
24, "Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office."
9, "One day I was at a baseball game in @LOCATION1 and the line was huge it stretch out for half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would’ve gone crazy, so that’s my story about patience."
17, "There was only @NUM1 minutes of class left and I had @CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock tick down over so slowly. @NUM1 minutes left @NUM3 @NUM4 at @NUM5, the teacher asked, “what are you doing?” I said, “@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do” “why don’t you put your headdown?” I was losing my patience and was going to snap, but didn’t. I put my head down and next thing I know, its time to go. I kept my patience and didn’t get in trouble."
12, "Today I am talking about patents. Patents mean’s to take something easy or to handle something with comaness.

The boy said “@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4 ???, so I can buy this game. The father said “@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but I’m sorry I need to help your mother pay bills. The @CAPS6 said “@CAPS4 I understand.” @CAPS8 the boy’s grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my law for @NUM5”. The boy grinned and said “ I’ll be right over there.” @CAPS1 mowed the lawn with excitement. When @CAPS1 got the @NUM5??? @CAPS1 went right to the game store and when @CAPS1 arrived the line was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother said “well you gatto have patience. “@CAPS10 as the boy was next in the line. To be continued”"
20, "This story is about chicken hand the fox and a time he had to be patient. Let me set the scene, clung the scourge sends chicken hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch. But chicken hound had only blached out. When he awoke he realized his situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to @CAPS1 wall and waited although insects had snowded on him. Finally when the cover of night came he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his journey. That is when chicken hound had to be patient."
16, "I have used patience many times. I use my patience when @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home and at school. The first time when used patiencewas when I was fishing. I was to at the time I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and viniger in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend bubbles a norweigian goose he was also out maybe a week old. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked warms so I gave him all my bait put down pole. And as soon as I grabed my chips… I had a bite! I turned out to be a very small sun fish. But still to this day I see bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some side kicks two ducks I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true. The @CAPS3."

When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.”@CAPS3?!”I exclaimed.”That’s a long time.”@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said “@CAPS6 @CAPS7”! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end."

13, "One thing I am not very at ient with is the meap. The reason I am not patient with the meap because it is very boring you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the meap it is very difficult, you don’t see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expect you to do to much work the meap is one of the reason I dislike michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you never saw or herd before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do meap I wou ld prefer them to ask question and words that we know. Another thing I dont like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade of what they think of it. To mi the meap is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would chose not to do it. Since the meap is important I do it for my grade. These are the reason why I am very inpatient with the meap."
10, This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go no were or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt house an I had to clean up her house an I didn’t want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home an I was the only one there. When I went to @CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have  to take your shoes of than we got something to eat. The next day when everybody wolk up we heat from the hotel and went home an ate breakfast an than I didn’t won’t to ride my uncle four wheeler down the hill but he had started it up an push it but I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves. When I got to my grandma house. I didn’t know that every body was help but I dint want to but my mum made me help so nobody went outside to play football it was a good game cause I look out the window the whole game I didn’t patient cause I wasn’t in it. Wow a was watching the football game out the window the other childs run out the door an I was not done with the wall
16, "The time that I was patient was today when everyone was takeing the @CAPS1.E.A.P. when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the  paket that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the paket. Then we had to put our first and last name on it befour we could take a break. When the break was over we needed to get a n free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we ,got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didn’t want to read so then they all started to talk she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone to came in and would wach us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into into the tiny basket ball hoope and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we  would be starting the last writing sesson and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though or lunch and then everyone was  freaking out. So that was the time that I was just patient."
15, "I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They understood that I could only go a cartair spare and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stud from room to room. An example of someone showing this patience was @CAPS1 @PERSON2 had to hurry to go to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wouldn't be alone. Another example of someone being patient with me is @PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me  when I asked her….???????????"
12, Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.
15, "It was the @DATE1 when I went to see the creed consur with my cousents. There must have been @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us. Then I herd and saw people shauing and pushing to get in. About @NUM3 to @NUM1 minuts later my legs started acking but I held on. I keep telling my self, “the pain is worth the waite!” finaly we got to the security gardes they had to do a metle detecoter on us. When we walked into the consurt I said, “that was a wifer worth wating for.”"
18, "Patience is basicly waiting and tolerating it. Every year on @MONTH1 @NUM1 my family become seasonal at a camp ground. There @CAPS1 play and have fan and make many life long friends. Every weekend @CAPS1 go out there and @CAPS1 take are speed boat, ""the glass from. ""@CAPS1 pat it into the the lake and dock it at a dock. Then @CAPS1 go fishing on every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is were patience comes in @CAPS1 have to sit and watch oar bobbers float on the smooth glass like lake. @CAPS1 sit there and watch and talk and bake in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful thowe that I'm off school and I @CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then in school I have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over. So @CAPS1 sit there until the sudden noise of on of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that theres some yelling and ""@CAPS2 the net ""sayings. The funny. Part is that it is that it is ethier a large bass or a small nor there. And all this takes patience."
10, "My dog  tedy bear is very impatient because when he comes in from outside he gets a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in"
16, "There’s many times I’ve been patient @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept buging me, and I didn’t scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said “no”, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didn’t become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person."
21, "A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!"
16, "When I was very patient was the, time I had to get my teeth pulled it had took two hours they would take a break for about @NUM1 minutes every half an hour I had gotten  many shots in my mouth. And they had ripped my gum open and took at two teeth. Then my two bottom teeth. I was patentance then. They even said I was one of there best kids cause of every thing I had went thorugh in my mouth and the long time panke. This was the time I got @NUM2 teeth pulled and was very patient."
20, "“When can I drive?” I wined. “when the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you won’t yelled my @CAPS1 over the loud, heart warming sound of @CAPS2. Starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound. It’s my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattaling my lags as it races away with @PERSON1 driving. I could wait until my turn. After I rides and @NUM2 mins. @CAPS1 said the words I thought he’d never say,” @CAPS3, your turn.” I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. “@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldn’t go fast but I almost tipped it over. So that’s a good thing. So all in a nat shell, paconts comes a long way."
13, "One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early. So we had to be patient too. We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when you’re late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1."
19, "Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!"
7, On @DATE1 we went to the doller tree I want to go to the game stop. But I was patient then we went to the game stop.
17, "I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working everyday in the @DATE1. I was trying to do the best I could to make make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I haven’t had anything close enough to shoot since then."
18, "When we drive to @CAPS1 I have to be patient. When we are in the car I really have to be patient because it takes @NUM1 hours plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, out for lunch, plus we stay for the night. But when we are on the road it is so @CAPS2, That is how I need to be patient. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. I contains a book, ped of paper. My dad’s laptop also. A big factor is my ipod. Exposcally I don’t like that my legs got all??? and the??? ???. ??? ??? hate that felling. But at the end result I love??? you just have to be patient enough to get there and the end factor is the best."
13, "When I think of being  patient I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey, we were on the road for @NUM1 ½ hours! While  we were on the way there i didn’t say one thing about how much longer or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all my hockey friends wathing a hockey movie. When I think of patients I think of wating without asking  “@CAPS1 it done yet?’’ or “Are we there yet?” I myself dont have the best patients. when I want the computer or to role the guard or frarwheeler and someone was on those things I tend to ask “when will he be dane!” alot. Patients grows with you when you develop, as you get older you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long even this test takes patients!"
22, "This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 the part cucry one forgets is the @NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 familis all my friends.

We didn't know what to do @CAPS3 was hopeless .We had to sit and wait if out sit was a true talk of patience. We??? @NUM3 home??? @CAPS3 was the longest @NUM3 horrs ever. We did nothing. @CAPS1 as we wanted we bolted out of our seats and into the air read @CAPS3 was over. We didn't have to be patient no longer."
16, "A Time I was patient was the time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I whent to the @CAPS3 @NUM1 hours early. @CAPS7 we walk up to the front desk panting from ruming because we thought we were late and the @ORGANIZATION2 said ""Are you ok!"" I said ""@CAPS4, am I late for the appointment for foyce""! Wo your @NUM1 hours early "" she said"" @CAPS2 you pulled me. Out @CAPS1 two favorite hours in school to be @NUM1 hours early""!

11, One time I was pacient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to baby sit my cousin @CAPS2 while his room pack up cause they were making back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets his way. But I was pacient  and waited til the trip was away. I didn’t complain til  I got home til  my mom. Me and my cousin got in lots of fights on that vacation. But I still love him . I had to be very pacient with my cousin and even maybe do what he wanted but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 wanted to go to the pack.I knew I had to give in ( considering that hes @NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the pack. That was a time that I had to be pacient.
16, "One time I went to the doctors. The docter said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said a nother docter will come in. we waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The docter that was spose to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion. I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the docters so patience always has a reward."
18, "On our way to @CAPS1 point ! I’m screaming in my head .It’s so crazy ! were just derost from on lake erie . I see it ! It was right there within walking distance .Oh my gosh the parking lot we pull up in all the way to the stamp station & we get our stamps & we walk up to the medal bars we stop & the security say “ no” .We found out it only opens at ten so we waited & waited & waited & more & more & more people came ,& soon it got really crowded & more people came & me & my cousins @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 all went to go play phase title and we had wait in line for that to .Finally @NUM1 time to get into the park we all crowded up to the fince & ram out selfs in there we went and got in line  for the rapter for @NUM2 min .Man what a line but hey it was so worth it .And yes patience helps “a lot “"
16, One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line. We where mad and my dad was losing his patients too. We wait for hours till it was finally our turn. We wait that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time l lost my patients.
16, "When my family went to makiew  we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient because we had to wait toget on the  boat. We had to wait at least @NUM1 minutes for the boat.

So we have a lot of planning to do in a month in a half.It’s very hard, she has to be patient. Watch my mom?? ?? plan a party and still be able to ?? on the trip to @LOCATION1 with my family.

His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!!@CAPS2 hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of dentist office. @CAPS2 had to go in three days and he was even more scared because he's going by himself this time. He then realized that he can't be such a baby so he desited to be patient. He easily waited throw the whole two day and then the day came. He woke up and he road his bike down to the dentists and then he wait a short period of time before he had to go back to the room wear the dentist give you your check up. He desited to close his eyes and be patient. After it was over he went home and was relieft  patients was there."
10, "Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a @CAPS1’s office you must patiently wait your turn to see the @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for “wait” you have to be wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you “@CAPS2 wait to see the @CAPS1. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. another example is “@CAPS3” when familys go on a road trip you here @CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patience”? I would say “wait” wait your turn, ??? for the dos, wait for the @CAPS1, and wait for us to get there."
16, It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1’s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn’t start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And that’s a time when I was patient.
13, "One of the most patient time I have ever had was in downtown @LOCATION1 at one of the greatest @CAPS1 places around @CAPS1 poupules!

17, "I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday @DATE1 I was over my dads house. My dad asked me were do I want to go for my birthday. I didn’t know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him I’m done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn’t going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient."
22, "I remember a time when @CAPS3 sister used to go on and on about @CAPS4 cream sundaes and all that. @CAPS3 mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3 dad was sick so that meant the “@CAPS4 cream girl” had to come along too! @CAPS3 mom knew @CAPS6 was in for a long day. @CAPS5 were in the car and @CAPS5 drove past a @ORGANIZATION1 and that’s when @CAPS3 little sister decided out loud “I’m hungry I want @CAPS1!!!.” That is what @CAPS6 said yelling for five minutes straight. That’s when @CAPS3 mom yelled “you speak another about @CAPS4 cream you are @CAPS2 getting it!.” @CAPS3 sister then had this face that meant @CAPS6 was about to cry, which was even worse!!! @CAPS3 mom gave her a cookie so @CAPS6 would stay content for a while; @CAPS5 started driving home when @CAPS5 heard a song on the radio, @CAPS3 sister loves to put the word “@CAPS4 cream” in every song so @CAPS6 started squirming while holding her tounge. @CAPS6 stayed that way all afternoon. @CAPS6 didn’t speak a word that entire day! So @CAPS5 drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and then @CAPS6 started to cry. @CAPS6 had enough. “I want @CAPS4 cream!!.” @CAPS5 were messing with her, so @CAPS5 went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the thing @CAPS6 wanted most her  “@CAPS4 cream.” @CAPS6 was patient the entire day, @CAPS6 knew it was hard work. @CAPS3 little sister learned an important lesson that day, that “Being patient means good things will come to you."
20, "Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so muc h.  About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I defien tly had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered  my new boots. When they arrived, they were too  small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didn’t come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something,  I goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week.  Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But @CAPS1 the problem is fixed and I’m glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 riding comfortably in my new riding boots."
24, A time I was patiet was when I was wating for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School end’s at @NUM1 so I had to wait out side for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about @NUM2 f degrees. It was vary windy too so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much becaus I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot choclate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was vary hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient.
16, "This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was a two days before I had to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you fill sleepy. I usally never have patient’s but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experience why people should have patient and it’s easy to do. Today was my doctors appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always fill sick and tired.  My mom will go sign my name in and I fill more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had call me and I was terrified my mom always told me that it don’t hurt if  you don’t look at it. So I went back to the doctor office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was really he gave me an hearing test and a eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finish with my hearing test, I was finish and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learn how to have patients. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor."
17, "A  time  when  I was  patient  was  when  my brother, and sister , and I were told  we  were  going to @LOCATION1; which is a big deal  to us .My  sibling  and I were fighting  in the kitchen about  something  stupid  of  course, when  all of  a sudden  our  parents called us out.” @CAPS1 great”. I thought. As I was thinking  about what punishment  we were going  to get  my mom broke my thought and told  us  we  were goig on vacation.“@CAPS2 punishment,” I asked. “what” my  mom replied. “@CAPS3,” I told her.  We were going on vacation to @LOCATION3  and  to  @LOCATION2. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask “when are we going on our trip?” and every day my mom would say the soar thing. “In one week, in four days, in three, days, in two days.” @CAPS4 it was  the day to go on our vacation and  my parents were proud of me for  being  very  patient for  a week  waiting  to go to  @LOCATION3. That was a time when I was very patient."
19, "A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother so we could return abox that didn’t work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for an half of an hour and watch nothing but angry coustumers. Still @CAPS1 wasn’t our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all in fact he when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient the worker, (even though she didn’t want to be) the worker didn’t know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always like @CAPS1 says “good things come to those who wait” @CAPS1 is very true so remember! Be patient."
11, "One time when I was patient I was playing a football game with my friends and the other team was creaning us. But even though we were losing I still managed to stay calm and we ended up beating them, @NUM1"

At the end of the day, my family and  I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the “@CAPS4 timbers.” The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn’t want to wait long. She said “you need patience”  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said “mom that patience really paid off”."

That is the time when I had to be patince when I had to wait to get my bow. Now almost ever day I’m outside shoting it. Thanks for listening and reading.
9, "Let me get one thing straight… I’m not patient. I mean, I can be at times but. Mostly I’m not. If here is something coming up @CAPS1 my birthday, I will not stop taking or thinking about it. By not being patient I just mean I can’t wait. Most of the time… @CAPS1 when we are going to a boreing family house, I can wait."
16, "One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2!"

24, "Crack I twisted through the air and anded face up with my arm-rapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain @CAPS1 I wobbled to my feat, “what just happened?” I thought to my self I once again began to feel the nurendous pain shooting through my fore arm. I bit my lip @CAPS1 hard @CAPS1 I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouning out like a water fall. My friends launched toward asking me. if I was ok @CAPS1 soon @CAPS1 I started holding my arm. “I think I might have broken it” I replied in between jobs they rushed to get an aid @CAPS1 quickly a possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an ex ray at childrens hospital. There were both at work and were not able to come and get me @CAPS1 the day groaned on I became more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang it was @NUM1 at last.  “bang!” the door swung open it was my dad and not for behind him was my mom. @NUM1 is when they get out of work after my mom and dad told be how much there were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm , they immediately rushed me to @LOCATION1. That was my experience of a time I had to patient. And in the end it turned out I had a broken arm. In life there are going to be many situations where your going to have to be patient, lout all you can do is take life @CAPS1 it comes at you."
20, "@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets very impatient. He says things like, "@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2" "@CAPS1 on!"  @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line. @CAPS5's himself again which is a great relief on my past!"
19, "When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my @CAPS1 agreed on helping study for my upcoming test. So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient. So my mom got home drove me and we ended up a hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still try to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to helping me for about @NUM1 hours but she followed through and really helped me and I actually got a A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that and I am very grateful to know someone like that."
18, "One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said “are mom and dad”. He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reason’s why I had to be patient on are @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town."
16, A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and sayed there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called downs to have lunch. That the time when I was patient over something.
14, One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me. It took him a while but I just stood there and waited. It took him around @NUM1 minutes because he needed help with a lot of thing. That is the time I was patient.
14, "I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be I am. For example at my house we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go. But I have to wait because I don’t want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have.  If we didn’t there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient she can wait in one spot for hours one time it was @CAPS1 I was all figtxy from waiting until the bell rang so we can go trick or treating. She waited well she did her hair I complained that is a reason why patience is important."
23, "One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs, with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didn’t know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldn’t take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn’t take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didn’t let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said “@CAPS1,” and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didn’t know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days."
17, "“@CAPS1 on hurry up,” my friend said. “I know, be patient,” I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed. Being patient is all ways a good thing have you ever heard something like “Patience is a virtue? Well if you don’t get used to it."
15, The time I was patient was when I went @CAPS1 fishin with my step dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs. My step dad said you set ur pole down on a sling shot holder and do whatever. So I went walk around explore the world and I was think about how I can do patience. I was to go check on my pole and I got nothing so I feel in the coast out for way so I sat wait and wait but until that moment my pole start to jak around so I reel in caught a large @CAPS1 I was so happy. My step dad said see you do got patience.
23, I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasn’t feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said “@CAPS1 it’s already been ten minutes” “I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor.” I said. “I don’.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. “@CAPS1 it’s almost @NUM1!” “@CAPS2!” I said flustered and annoyed. “Are we just gonna sit here all day?” I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. “@CAPS3 for being patient! the nurse said smilling. I smiled back. I @CAPS4 been patient.
7, When I'm being a patient and I @CAPS1 nicely and I do not complain and I like to be pation and I @CAPS1 good I do not fell and sometimes people don't be them to calm down and sometimes when something is is taking forever I sometimes sat come on and I always be patent at school at restaurants and I always be patent ever I where bat sometimes I can't not be patent and I don't want people thanking  I m weird of ating  some thing I just @CAPS1 a neit it and I be patent in lines at the fail and at the fair sometimes have long lines and that is my goal is being patent of everything but sometimes I'm not patent because sometimes  something take to long and I just like to be patent.
20, "Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldn’t sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, “hi!” very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient."
14, "I was patent when I was waiting for a chance to go to cicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to @LOCATION1. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn’t bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I keept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn’t care about @LOCATION1. No mater how tempting it was seing @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 hawks game on I kept my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagen that it was @NUM1 and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nut shell no mater how long it took, I would be patient."
22, "A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. “sit boy,” I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. “@CAPS2 here I’m done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please,’’ I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “@CAPS1 done !” I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. “@CAPS6!” I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesn’t listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off."
20, "@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3â€� I can hear the clock ticking ,probly to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Every body is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 seem so long? Its almost @NUM1 minute now.the aroma of peperoni  pizza is so strong that I can practicly taste @CAPS4. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @NUM3 Iâ€™m not sure. The tension ogf the whole class is so great,I think my brain will erupt. I cant take this, @CAPS4â€™s way to much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 seems to be an eternity, @CAPS4 couldnâ€™t have been just a few seconds could @CAPS4? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5 why is time so short? Iâ€™m not a very patient, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do Iâ€™m not seeing @CAPS4 got. Iâ€™m about to just jump out of my seat as if Iâ€™m ejected from a @DATE1. Iâ€™m trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that Iâ€™d be this anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Were down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4â€™s enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again,brouse this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding is more like @CAPS4. â€œ@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,â€�the clock nocking me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds I canâ€™t bare this much longer. I think am about to snap. I donâ€™t handle patience well. @CAPS4â€™s a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. Iâ€™ll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10, â€œ@CAPS10!â€� finaly, the bell goes of signaling lunch time . I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone."
23, "On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in little travers bay for salmon, there was a tromendus hep on the trolling line, I lanched from where I was sitting like a rocket I heaved on the line I waited. I thought it was a false alarm (snag) put trust me I thought wrong. the pull did a dance then bent realy fast again. ''@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cosin, he ran back to my aid. We @CAPS4 stared at the water the poll still flexed didn't move, I was looking for the tumble weed because I felt like I was in an old western movie stand of. Finale I looked at my cousin & said, ''I have been patient, do you think I should real him up""? ""@CAPS3 me get the net first'', he fumed and grabed it then stated ""When you are ready"" I slowly cranced the handle on the real tie, tie, as I slowly cranted him from l??freaky depths. Then out of no where the steel cable that was my line shot from the ball like a bullet, but the a cyrick jerk from him and then the line went slak. My cosin & I @CAPS4 knew what had happened. the @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to flustrat more fisher men with his patient ways."
18, "One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish under was going off like crazy but know fish were biling . @CAPS5 got the point (in a short time I might add) where our dog would back like crazy wherever we started to real in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we’d have to move again because of the current .After we’d  been sitting there for house on end .I felt something  on my line. I thought  at first I was snagged on a rock, @CAPS1 I started to reel in, the line came a little, @CAPS1 I reeled some more, I thought @CAPS5 felt like a fish pulling on my line, @CAPS1 I called out , “@CAPS3 ,dad, I think t have a fish !”. @CAPS1 my dad told me @CAPS4 to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, “@CAPS4 kind is @CAPS5? He said, “@CAPS5’s a walleye.” I didn’t know @CAPS4 to say. My first walleye! And dad even said @CAPS5 was big enough to @CAPS6! @CAPS1, then we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner."
18, "@PERSON2, get down here I need you to open an evelope! My mom said. We spanted down stairs because an envelopes can only mean, a report card, letter, @CAPS1 card, or checking account balance.  We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a starrer on the back that said @NUM1 radio. We open @CAPS6 and @CAPS6 says congroduclotions you won tickets to @NUM2 first @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with @PERSON1!" I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprise just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was the lines about @NUM3 girls were lined up at the front doors of the @CAPS4 oak music @PERSON3. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out, we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. @NUM4 Â½ hours later we were waiting then I see this boys head pop out a window of the music @PERSON3 and say," @CAPS5 girls!. After he said that about @NUM5 girls went crazy screaming. @NUM6 Â½ hours later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for @NUM7 hours @CAPS6 felt good. Iyaz Was the special guest to get us warmed up for @PERSON1. When he got out every girl was screaming their lung out! He sang the concert and @CAPS6 was a great experience for my first concert ever!"
20, I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn’t get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didn’t do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didn’t ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port @NUM1 got nothing. Like at @TIME1 I saw my cousin and she gave me @MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and don’t have to ask for something.
13, "I asked my mom if I can get a phone but she said no, not yet. She said I cant have one till @NUM1 grade unless I get a @CAPS1 phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okey. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on @DATE1 . I said I’ll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. That’s one time I had to be patient."
11, "Have you ever heard your mom or dad say patience is a virtue. Well I’ve heard it many times in my house actually too many times. Patience is a something that means you have to wait like when you wanna go see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a big line cause it’s a new movie. So your gonna have wait with patience!"
24, "@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1. They got everything they needed fishing pots. Tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. The sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish."
19, "@CAPS1's cold @CAPS1's raining, I'm wet @CAPS1's been @NUM1 hour and still no activity. All I have to do is wait. I'm hunting deer hitting with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a decent shot but not that good. I know patients is the key to deer hunting so I will just have to wait. I now see a deer about @NUM2 yard away and shoot @CAPS1 so my patience pays off"
21, "Everybody loves @CAPS1, and they all have to be patient for it. Especially on the @TIME1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS3. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and can’t wait until morning, especially me. I get so excited I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year had to be the hardest. It was @NUM1 am on @CAPS1 morning and I had woken up for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and did for only about thirty minutes when I woke up again. I just couldn’t fall asleep! I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM3 am most of my brothers were up and I couldn’t take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I finally was told yes and began to open my presents. I was finally happy."
10, There are some ?? ??? in ??? ??? you ??? ??? to second and one of those thing is a patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate and when you experience thing that not ??? complain that when patience is.You have to have patience if you planning on having kids or being  I cather or any other job you have to wait in ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???.Those are a just a couple reason why ??? patience.The final reason that am going to say you need patience is because in life everything  is not just ??? to you.You have to work for it and to that you have to have patience.So no matter what if you don’t have patience you will have  a really hard time getting through life.So thse are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience.So if you don’t have patience learn to be patient.I believe that you can do it all you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don’t complain about ??? that hard in life there is going to be a lot of hard things in life.Theres only one more thing I have to say and that is just try.
9, "The time I was vary vary patience was when I was about seven and me, mom, dad, sister, bothers, and grandma from up north (were we got my grandma) to west virgina and back most of the time I was sleeping or waking up sum were eating playing at a hotel pool. Sleep and then hit the road the next day. the thing that I had to be so patience about was that we were going to have @CAPS1 there so I wanted to open my presents. and one time we got stuck so that slowed us down about  a hour our . So when we @CAPS2 got there I jumped out ran is fast is I could opened the door and surpise marry @CAPS3 guys."
24, "When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3 “can we go to get pizza?” @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, “if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza”. I didn’t want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked. “Were done with the house @CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed” she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to faster” @CAPS3 answers. “@CAPS4, fine I’ll help”, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “lets do!” @CAPS5 the whole day I waitd @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish @CAPS1 in the end I finished the job."
10, "My mom was pation because when I came home late from the park she was be pation, but she wasn’t pation when she took the phone away from me she wasn’t pation. When my brother get he has pations for him and my sister but none for me. Just because I came home @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had pations before I did that and now she has a little bit of pations for me just a little."
23, "One time I was patient because I was hunting it was a cold @DATE1 play I am sitting in blind with my dad waiting for a deter. It`s almost eight “o’ clock and we have been out there since @NUM1. We hear the ducks and geese making noises in the marshland next to us, we could see the trees dance in the wind. Smell the trash dance of grass and the morning fog. Then out at nowhere at @TIME1AM then came another doe. They went by us with caution so I got the gun ready. Then out came the eight point bunch I shot him through the heart and lung. I also gutted him. The year at @DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off."
23, "@CAPS5 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 loved playing various games with her younger brother @PERSON1 @CAPS2! One day when she was playing sorry with @PERSON1, sadly @PERSON1 was taking an unpleasable amount of time on his turn. @CAPS5 was getting extremely angry at @LOCATION1 for taking so long. So @CAPS5 started scream. As you can imagine when @CAPS5 and @PERSON1â€™s @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard this she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 â€œ@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about? I sure hope your not screaming at @PERSON1!â€� â€œ@CAPS4 I was, but thatâ€™s only because @PERSON1 wonâ€™t hurry up!â€� @CAPS5 exclaimed. â€œ@CAPS4 @CAPS5 says sorry to @PERSON1 then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. Heâ€™s younger then you, which means he doesnâ€™t know any better.â€� @CAPS8, @PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully.â€�  Iâ€™m so sorry @PERSON1!â€� @PERSON3 said with a tear trickling down her cheak. So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry."
15, "One time there was a huge. Project!!! I needed to know what my grade was!! It was ralls impostant for it was a difference between a @CAPS1- to a @CAPS2!!

20, "This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the @TIME1, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, @CAPS1!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1. I was ??? to  get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally” That was the story of how I Was patient."
11, "Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday."
19, One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!
13, "What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to “hurry” or “move faster.” @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect."
12, One day it was me and my mother we was going to the store @CAPS1 we had to go and pick up my big brother from basketball practice @CAPS1 we got there and he wasn’t outside @CAPS1 my mother was calling his phone phone and he wasn’t answering @CAPS1 my mother keep calling @CAPS1 my mother said that were going to wait until he get out now that’s what I call patience.
15, "There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. I was a cold @DATE1 day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. the person next to me said the say thing, but she was patient and said “okay” @CAPS1 the sub let the kid go. That was time a person I know was patient."
21, "Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better."

17, "Patience is something you have to work on I do not have a lot of patience, I do not like waiting at all it is not fun .I do not like waiting ,because being patient is boring and five @CAPS2 feels like twenty @CAPS2. Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for package is the worst.  You wait and a sit and wait, then you forgot about it and then it comes .One day I was waiting to go to my friend house it felt like forever since I’ve seen her but it had only been about ten months .I missed her like crazy .We have been planning this “or weeks it was finally the day of get to go over @CAPS1 .Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me @CAPS1 and he takes forever .Finally we got in the??? We were waiting five @CAPS2??? Then he gets months??? and drove away .I swear we got shopped at every red light from my house to @CAPS3’s house and got struck behind the slowest drivers so that made it werse .When we finally got @CAPS1 I jumped out of the truck ,@PERSON1 ran through the door down  then stars almost tripping down each one . She practically jumped on me we we hugging for like five @CAPS2. That is why I’m not patient."
17, "A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was basically @NUM3, so I missed @CAPS1 appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time @CAPS1 mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment wer finished. We waited at least an hour an a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly I listened to music the rest of the time until they called @CAPS1 name. In conclusion this is a time when I was patient."
11, "Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is."
10, A time l had to be parcint was at the doctor tick tock. The clock went around and around.

17, "When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enugh to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long ! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for ! I was not oppernutity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to top. My mom and I were so patient !So we waited ,and waited ,and waited .Till we were finally at the top .Then we came down .It had been worth the wait ! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long."
24, "Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear “@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.” so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hear” @CAPS1 get ready grandm @CAPS4 I coming to get you. “I said it`s @NUM3 @CAPS5 are you nuts?” at this time I was at a family members house @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said “@PERSON2 was in a bad crush.” @CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying.” get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info.” I got off phone @CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting @CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through @CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? @CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned @CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is @LOCATION1, where is @CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. @CAPS8 I got the call I asked @CAPS6 dad “what happen what did he hit, who called @NUM4, where do we go?” the first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dads mouth was” calm down I can`t come home but @PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him ok” yes dad I will and dad” I said” you” he said back. I said ‘I love you.” “I love you too” he said. The worst time for @CAPS6 life was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were @CAPS6 dads when @CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with @PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing @CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in @PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him @CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me.” @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said @PERSON1 come here “@PERSON1 went. @PERSON2 said ‘thank you for taking care of @CAPS6 little sister I love you man.” That is the time in @CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see @CAPS6 brother. I didn’t care how he looked as long as he is ok."
19, "I am going to be writing a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to ceder point. and it was this ride called the @CAPS1 the best, and highest roller coaster at ceder point. So we got in line it was so long we had to wait @NUM1 to get on the ride, because the line was so long. So I had my uncle who wasent getting on the ride to go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips because I was so hungry and thirsty. So while I was being patient, my other family was not being very patient. I was the only one patient. So @NUM2 past we still in line my family started fussing. @NUM3 hrs past they were getting madder. Then @NUM4 hrs came we were starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off. So finally, we got on the ride, we enjoyed it. Then I had to explain how patient I was.  And how unpatient they was not."
9, "Patience is like waiting for something and not froaring out. Imagine if no one had patience everything would suck. Picture this your at the store there is a line at the register, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience that would not happen. Since the people have patience the world has order so if you think about it it's a good thing."
24, "Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbor’s house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didn’t have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn’t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away… and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: @CAPS7 only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood."
21, "This is the time when I was patient. One @DATE1 day I was playing with my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient"" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine she got that to. So I just keep waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered to the next day my dad had already gotten what my brothe and sister wanted, and I was the only one who my dad and mom that never gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard just takes patience. Thats how patience helps you ecomplish what you want."
14, "I was patient for @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 present. It was almost @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 and I m kept asking for @DATE1 presents, but @DATE1 mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and I kept asking, until @DATE1 mom said be patient you will get them don't worry, but of course I had a hard  time being patient. Final it was the @DATE1 and I couldn't wait but I had to. @DATE1 I went to bed I asked once more and again she said no. The @DATE1 come and I went to school. I was so happy because today was @DATE1 @DATE1 and I got present's to @DATE1, I got home and @DATE1 mom was waiting with a cake and a present, she said ""there are more "". That was the t i tryed being patient."
17, "A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldn’t go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldn’t see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldn’t see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasn’t a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed.            In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didn’t and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient."
18, It was late @DATE1  when my @CAPS1 is and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever  to drive  there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there  were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd  came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the  hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park  for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was  closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer  that added a @CAPS5 to our time  because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didn’t have one drop of  patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didn’t I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
22, "A time when I was patient, was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said “can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?” I replied “sure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in  line for the ride. I said “we should ride front row.” @CAPS4 said “we should.” @CAPS5 we went to the front row and the line was packed. @CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employies had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. @CAPS5 we kept waiting and waiting un till they let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed “who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7,” @CAPS6 dad replied “I don’t know.” @CAPS7 day is a day that I rember @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasen’t worth the wait. What was worth the wait is seeing the smile on @CAPS6 sister’s face and her laughing."
16, One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting unpatient. My grandma said “@CAPS1 keep waiting it will come soon”. So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also we all got @NUM1 players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth.
17, "About @NUM1 weeks ago I order a look series at border online, I had to be very patient so it would feel like @NUM2 year of waiting. This book series was not like any book series @CAPS1 books are my favorite book they’re call the @LOCATION1 series. I have read the series @NUM1 times and I am still reading them. But, I had to wate to get them. I trying to patient, but it was hard. The mailing date said in less than @NUM4 hour. I had to wate for @NUM5 day before it a came, When I forget about them they come! Being patient is a good qulatie people can have. So if your  patient you will probably get what you want."
18, "A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes."
17, When I first saw my puppy @CAPS3 were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought over some dog to be rescued @CAPS3 saw all six dogs second one I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So @CAPS3 got him out the lady said that he’s scared and he gets carsick but I didn’t care he was my favorite. @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 wanted him so she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and tell them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4 so @CAPS3 raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and on the way there @CAPS3 thought of names. My dad came up with the name @CAPS6 @CAPS3 liked it so that was his name I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine @CAPS3 got him a toy when @CAPS3 went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him the day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 were going fishing since he didn’t know @CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once @CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him @CAPS3 took him home he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But @CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @CAPS6 its bed time and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough patient is the key.
14, "I belive that patients means that you are understand and tolerant and that a patient person. experiences difficulties without complaining. This story is about the time I was patient with my little brother. @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1. Five more minutes I metered after about fifteen more steps from the alarm clock. I jumped out of bed remembering that I was babysitting my little brother ??? I take the crispy ??? I thought to myself, as I tryed to swallow the rock heart breakfast on my plates. I quickly take a shower and get dress into jeans and t shirt. At the time @PERSON1 was about two years old??? Missed there service he could walk.

17, "A time when I was patient was when I was at my football and the defence hid the was in and I was waiting to go back in. Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball an dthe offense including me ?n in on the field, and then they had me run it up the middle and I scored and then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and it tipped it then it came right down in my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defence ?? back in but then it was half time. I am the kick returne and we got the ball as I got the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my tem was bleding and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1 the all the other ?? we doing kneeing it and finally my ?? swotted the pass and if one a ?? the my team jumped on it and we had the ball then our full back got a pass and got the game wining touch down and thats atime when I had to be patient"
20, "Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that."
14, Being patience is when someone could be bisy is just better to be patience while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patience. Well on one morning my mom had got out of work when she came I told my mum that I really wanned to go over my friends house. But my mom just keept on saying to wait and so I had to wait so I did? My mom wasn’t even done still so I told her if I could go working to my friends house. But she said no and that I had to be patience till she was done. My dad was living to his work in the afternoon so I had an idle. I told my dad if he could drop me off my friends house and then he could live to his work. So I did I went to tell him. But guess what he said no coz he was already late and I looked at the time and yhea he was already late so I dicided to just be patience coz my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched tv while my mom was done. My mum had went insid the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said “yes” I so yelled so you are tackeing me and so she did I was so happy I rushed to the car and so we went and I went and my mom had left and that was the day I got to go to my friends house for just being patience.
18, "“@PERSON1 lets go this line is taking to long!” “@CAPS1 @PERSON2 just be patient!” “@CAPS2?”asked  @PERSON2 “@CAPS3 @NUM1 replyed. “@CAPS4 @CAPS2?” “You have never heard of patient ?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6 you want to tell me that out of all these thirteen yraes you have never heard of paitients?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6 your trying to tell me that put of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS9” @PERSON2 replied in a confused voice . “@CAPS10 @CAPS12 well patient is when. Wow I never know patience would be @CAPS6 hard to explain.” “@CAPS11 now do you get why I dont know!” “I got it!”he yelled as he snaped is fingers.  @CAPS16 one in the line was staring at them. There faces turned red. But @PERSON1 ignored that fact and said, “@CAPS12 @CAPS6 paitience is like when you wait a long time but you dont care that you wait a long time and in the end  because you @CAPS20 patiently you get what you wanted.” @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 in line. Soon @CAPS21 they were up next. “@CAPS14 tickets to @CAPS15 @CAPS16 where I look please: @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 said excitedly. “@CAPS17 ummm hold on one sec while I open a new package of tickets.” the ticket booth man told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 then said “@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: @CAPS19 @CAPS20 in this line for twenty minutes and now I have to wait more?” @CAPS23 you go kids thats @CAPS14 dollars please.” @PERSON2 was emmbarased but yet happy he got his tickets, @PERSON1 said “@CAPS11 you @CAPS20 and got what you wanted thats called patience. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 sat down in the movie theater and watched a great movie. If they wernt patient they would have never gotten to @CAPS11 thier new favorite movie!"
10, Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don’t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patients I wouldn’t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don’t have and they get bad grades and everything.
16, "Every day I have to be patient, acctualy every one has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a sibling? If so then you know how I felt when my sister didn’t want to go out side out of her own self wanting reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go out side with me because we have a special willow tree that we bang out of any way, I was getting off topic, since she kept refusing to get out and exercise I had to result to telling my mother, you can image a she didn’t, my sister brought a book, we assign and then? We got to a??? Way??? Middle of my neighbor hood and we went separate way, I, of course, didn’t??? this and had to waste as a friends house ??? have until she realized a want going to follow her. So I‘ve been annoyed with patience, but?? ?here told it’s a vertue so a guess??? O.k. with that."
24, "Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around."
20, "Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her drivers licence. She was to and was so excited to be able to drive. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place she saw that there were a lot of  people waiting. She estimated about @NUM1 people were there, “@CAPS1 did there have to be so many people here,”she thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting she got @CAPS6 mad, because only one person got his licence in the time period. She thragh a big fit  right there. “ugghh! I was supposed to get my licence today not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!” she started blabbering and said. “@CAPS1 do you guys take so long! You are so slow!” she went home and started talking to her faend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. “@CAPS2 there were many people I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!”   “@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient.”  “@CAPS4 the line was so long and . ’ @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. “@CAPS5 you keep running home crying, you will never got your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine.“@CAPS6 five hours!”“@CAPS7, @CAPS4 I took @NUM4 hours with me so I wouldn’t be bored. Take your phone with you. “@CAPS8, ’’ @PERSON1 replied.The next day she went back to the licence place, she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, went online and read her book for her book project. She kept moving in the line @CAPS4 she didn’t even realize @CAPS11. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day @CAPS4 she only thought @CAPS11 was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence, she was the second one in school in got her licence (after @PERSON2).“@CAPS9 @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down.”“@CAPS10 problem, @CAPS11’s the least I could do for my best friend.”"
9, "A time when I was patint is when I was at the fastifal. I whanted to get something to eat and the line was big. Another time is when I wanted to get on a ride the line was giantle large. It was for the @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 pirate ship, the swing. There was a line to play this baskeball game it was big."
12, "Patience is a  feeling that you get when you experience  are difficult task and do your best to  overcome it without  complaining about the task, like when your getting paint out and then  you  squeeze  it and it won’t come out, but you still keep trying until you figure out that  it is gone.  Then you go get a new bottle to start using. I wish that more people were patient, then we wouldn’t gave to listens to constant complaining."
24, "Here’s a story about time when I was patient. So the story begins at art prize and loved to see the beautiful art there, but I was dieing to see the winnig picture for art prize. My parent told me to wait until we all see the rest of the art prize amazing art. So I signed and replyed ok we can see the rest of the art prize things first.  While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. ??? A little bit later. I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at art prize. So I checied up and disieded patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while it all of a sodden it seems more valuable.  A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom intrupted and said, “@CAPS1 don’t you want to see the winning piece of art?” “@CAPS2 yes I forget.”@CAPS3 there is not a line now so when we go to see it there was no line. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patient is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like."
18, "Yo! I’m the narrator… you know the dude that tells the story, well I’m gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!"
12, "I have never bent a “patient” person @CAPS1 this girl I know @PERSON1 she is always patient like the time i was scared to go sleding down the hill and  I would not go down the hill I kept saying  “I’m not going down the hill.” @CAPS1 about @NUM1 min later she  was still patent she sied  “@CAPS2 I go down fist then will you go down.” I sied yes so she went down than I went down. And and the day of last yares dance I was takeing so long to get dressed,we were all redy late @CAPS1 she was so vary patient I was so spriced. I thik she has a surnus of patients I hope some of it rubes off on me because I need some and as soon as posable  and  alot of it  to because I bet ime the only person in the world without patiets wow!."
10, One time that I was patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name of the was halo reach. I had to wait @NUM1 weeks unit I could get it. But I was patient by waiting the whole time and not asking over and over agian.
17, "It was patient waiting to go to @CAPS1. It went through @NUM1 appointments. It was so excited and had the ladies to wait patiently and do many achievements and other activities respectively. On i.e. could offer everything, make especially new??? rave nily parents yells “at me and ??? you go against systems. I will have to be patient. I’l dish all night work, in the process ??? grade you a @CAPS2. It walked ??? days and dish everything else in @LOCATION1’s meat. Sitting it because such vast  will then tis with @NUM2th, ???"
15, "My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting till he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was. He was sitting inside, watching tv waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being patient."
20, ??? One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that’s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our??? ??? and @NUM2 extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to @CAPS1 adventure that next morning. Even though we were suppose to go
19, "One time I had to be patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @CAPS1 my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in @LOCATION1 so we were going to visit them. We had to drive @NUM1 hours in a small col bolt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited. When I first found out that we were going I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient. We had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about @TIME1 and we were fanaly @TIME1 my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didn’t have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient."
20, "What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didn’t work. My mom says I have to be @NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and she’ll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place."
17, "Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 I’ve had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I’ve always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 she said back was “@CAPS2, why are you up this early?” I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say “happy birthday” @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now I’m patient every day."
17, "Last @DATE1 I went with some friends to the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 is about christan rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient."
23, "“@CAPS1,when @CAPS5 we open presents?” I asked. “@CAPS2 we get back from church” she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedual, make @CAPS3 eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 eve service , have grand parents for dinner than all the kids get to open one present than go to bed for about one hour get up , and open more presents.  Amen,” our pastor concluded the service “@CAPS5 we go now, @CAPS1?” I blubbered “@CAPS6” she said.@CAPS8 we ate dinner I felt like I had ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to go by so slow I was @NUM1 years old before my grand parents left. Finally we were all gathered around the @CAPS3 tree @CAPS8 I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag than my dad said,” you @CAPS5 all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed.” @CAPS8 I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what I‘ll get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2. I jumped out of bed woke my sister up and ran into my parents room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end."
16, "A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasn’t ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn’t say nothing. I didn’t want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said girl what’s wrong with your har suprised. She felt her head and said o I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldn’t fit. So I let her do something and she couldn’t. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. That’s a time when I waited paintently on my sister."
17, "Two week sago meandmy family went to siyflags, for fright fest. The lines were going to be long and I would nevero be patient, I hate being patient . We went on @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first the lines was only ten minutes. Then the super man, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the riper. Then perisa wooden rollercoaster that goes of the track a lot we waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we sun the coster people with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we fin ally got to the front of the line my patients was @CAPS2. The roller coster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 mile coster but a tur one. That is the time I was  patient."
22, "“@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon don’t worry,” @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaing. Well over these few days (which feels like cons) I have not been this so called “@CAPS3” person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn’t come in the mail. I’ve been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fith time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn’t. “I’ve been sitting here since ten o’clock where is the @CAPS4 track!” I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! “@CAPS5 coming” I say to myself. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7  truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that’s it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps.” @CAPS10!” I sob in agony, “ why does this feeling consume me like this?” I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. “ @CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!” I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally!"
15, "About three or four times I was patience; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patience and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be to patience, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the  other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patince again so ,I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patince paper ."
10, There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice and this girls was so in aher she was getting on my nrvise because she push me and hitting me.

Then we where in class and so I rise my hand and she said be patient I said I am patient so shut up so shut up please so she don’t shut up so I my had a other time and the teacher call on me so she got mad at me.
16, "I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my room I she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. It was so oganizing. For example, I kept paceing back and forth but then I just sat down. After an hour of patientience, my mom and grandma said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally got my breakfast."
18, "A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the rest and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and more around, but were taking the @CAPS1 so I could not. Instead I entertaind myself in any way I could such as pretend singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! So finally she let us get and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway I kept trying too talk but I keep geting interupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finnaly it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so I never did get to say what mine was.This is a time when I was patient."
21, "Aplause  filled the building after the first dance ended. I was back stage with my dance team going over routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1 many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on excited bored and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting  that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!"
19, "Real @CAPS3 was one of fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very, impatient. Even when his friends and family spoke to him, this is what they pleaded like to him. ""@CAPS1…@CAPS2… @CAPS3…@CAPS4…are …You…doing?"" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he said that people didn't walk and was fast as he could. But that didn't when him team talk to them. For sure where can I find nement  @CAPS6?"" The @CAPS7 responded. ""@CAPS8…ch….first…eh….you….turn….eh….best…ch""   @CAPS9 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 screamed he had to believe that no one was as fast as he was. So he just had to be patient"
16, A time I was patient was when my mom was take me to my friends house to play foot ball. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride she said “yes”. So when we were driving my ???? she had to get after things from the grocery store. She took in hule hour in there. The she had to go some were else she took @NUM1 hours in there.then my called and said “are you coming or what’. Then I said yes. I was so kept my cool and waited. Then I finally got there. It not much of a story. That was the time I was patient.
14, "It was a hot @DATE1 day in @CAPS1 my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We went on all of the rides. Our last one was the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we were walking there. Once we got there the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back my parents were another back. ""@CAPS4 are we so far back?"" my brother said. My parent got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted got in line. We waited and waited until, something spontanious happend to us. The ten families were is the wrong line so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth waiting."
16, "A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boy went also. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On @DATE1 which was the after we got their we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpa’s sister @PERSON2. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost. The last time we went to florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, his little sister was getting @CAPS2 , I couldn’t wait to see them. The wedding was @CAPS3 I couldn’t understand it.So I waited for it to get over. After the wedding we went back to my aunt’s house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty-five but I had to by something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3 we left to go home. We got here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride their and back I waited patiently."
14, "Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now"
14, "A lime when I was patient was last year every day I had to be patient, because of my aunt. last year my aunt would pick me up in the back of the school someday I didn’t know if she was picking me up, like this one time it was the first day of school and I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know who was going to pick me up. I didn’t have a phone so I couldn’t call mane. There I was waiting being patience at the school. As I was waiting I with my friend to his house, then I went back to the school and waited. For about @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes or what felt about an hour my aunt came and picked me up."
23, "@PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said," @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball." I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked." "@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said "@CAPS3!" "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise," @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls." You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more," he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2." @CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?"I asked "@CAPS6 day!" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man. Happy, funny sweet and patient @PERSON3."
12, "Today I had to @CAPS1 Patient @CAPS2 of the meap. The meap is a @NUM1 to @NUM2 day @CAPS3. It has writing, reading, math. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school. I think it is the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help with your future jobs."
16, A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. @PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I make them @CAPS3 calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 sceawed out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then @PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was @CAPS4 and he's said I no @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 @CAPS3 being called that way @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.
19, "Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu’s and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasn’t frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again."
13, I have to be patient all the time when I’m teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong when are you patient? @PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he is still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things every day and when I go over it like @NUM1 times I get kind a mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him it helps train him faster! I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things and if I’m patient he will learn faster
18, "One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then @CAPS2. Since our truck didn’t have air bags it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the seen of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently and I was praying he was alright. And thankfully my prayers were answered.  He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to were truck was to get our belongings. And see what happened to the truck the damage on the truck was not nearly bad as what happened to the other drivers van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I’m glad I still have my brother."
20, "One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn’t break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,"
24, It was cold fall afternoon. Meant my grandpa where out on a hunting trip. We had geneat in the mornig @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what would happen that day.

20, "One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tryed to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasent coming off we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him we asked for bolt cutters. We had o walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there he tryed to cut the lock. He tryed for @NUM2 min. They wouldent work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. I think this took a lot of patients from coach @PERSON1."

After being in the car for two hours i moaned “are we there yet?’’ “no.’’ said @PERSON1 “were lost” “oh”  I replyed. But I really didn’t think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment.

I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said “ah-ah I know @CAPS1 your getting and you don’t. “And I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How come you know and I don’t? “That’s bad tell me please” And he said no “then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said “I give up” she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. “then I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see @CAPS1 I was getting. And that was the day I was patient."

We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right that’s to the lesson and @PERSON1’s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>’s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes."

16, "I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isn’t that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she’s resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldn’t open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didn’t wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all that’s been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldn’t because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time."

We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to give it all back to them.  We had to wait about fifteen minutes this time. So we waited and waited and waited. Finally they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and we got to eat our food. Also we got ice cream after we ate. ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patience. Thank you guys for being good!"" is what my mom said to us wen we got home. that is how I was patience."

Well over it did  they shut down the concert. So i went home soaking wet, my feet and hands. So i jus lay go to sleep and relax. P.S worse day of my life."
11, "I have to be patient when I’m taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I’m patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .I sometimes have to wait forever .But that’s fine I can just take a nap .I sometimes hate being patient .It just frustrates me .Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test .It’s good because you shouldn’t rush on the @CAPS1. Its justs frustrates me that people take so long .It’s not just at school it’s at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient .But it’s not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldn’t have to be very patient.O well I guess I’m just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient."
15, "The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. I’m not a person who ??? to be patient. When I want something I were that second. Cristmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cokkies, family and present. There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they don’t wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Something also it seemes to be all holidays are like that. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something I’m being patient on @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and flordia gators. Ficst @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bold game thing."
9, "I was patient in a plane ride going to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I possed exit them. I was also patient when my little brother. Much got a fly shot and I had to wait in the lobby. The biggets time I’ve ever been patient was with my brother and him going through my patient, breaking all my stuff, biting me with his toys and his constant whining or crying over stuff that he wants."
22, "During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something i have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad,cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2’s uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in a ocean. A few hours past and we didn’t catch anything,but we still waited while drinking coffe, telling  jokes, doing little  pranks like pulling  each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour. So i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to @LOCATION2 with my family."
24, "Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1’t control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!"

On the way   while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two was nurchaged and bath pulled over. They were beside the? With anger. Soon after that the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything and called in something. @NUM2 minutes later a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road.

We make it up to the counter and he’s showing thing about the phone, I want to get out of there so I could look at it myself. Me and my grandma finally leave and I have my new phone with and I like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!"
20, "One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. I was a fine day and was playing outside on the play ground, during lunch resses. He said that he was on the monkey bars. His hands got all sweaty and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He screamed. The resses ladies brought him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were picking me up. They picked me up and then got my bother. We drove to the hospital and they did x-rays. It took forever.

We finally got their, but I had to wait some  more for registration and I had to wait  till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin.  When the  bell rang we all went into the program center and waited  for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait @NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it)."

The earth was saved."
20, "A wize man once said patience is a is a vertue. Lets find out if that wize man is right. I’m going back @DATE1 years. I had just talked to my parents I said. “@CAPS1, call you by me this lego for @CAPS2?” “@CAPS3”, @CAPS5 said then @CAPS5 asked me to move. I kindly moved out of her way and @CAPS5 ordered it. It was @DATE1 when I asked her “@CAPS1 do you know my lego is coming?” @CAPS5 said “it should be here before or after @CAPS2.” I replied with an @CAPS7.K.. it was the week before @CAPS2 I had cheaked the mail. “no package” I thought to my self. So I checked the porch nothing. A week after @CAPS2 the mail man came. On top a package I could see. It turns out the wize man was right patience is a vertue. This is the time I was patient. I also learned its better to wait for some things."
16, "@CAPS4  @CAPS1 lives in ohio. He goes to @CAPS2 middle school and day after school he was walking home when @CAPS3 his friend asked him to wait in the parking lot for him so that he could call his mother and ask if  @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 had to wait an entire half hour while @CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother. But after @CAPS3 finished talking thanked @CAPS4 for being patient and they all spent the weekend at @CAPS8 house."
5, One time i was pacent  it was the time I wanted a I-pod tuch. My grandma was bidding on a I-pod tuch. It took a long  time to get it but we won. It took a long time for them to ship it but we got it. In the end it all paid off.
17, "A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning got dressed and left to go get in are deer blind. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gun shots. From shot guns, rifles and even black powder. We waited all day until it was dark again then we packed up and we left. Me and my dad didn’t see anything that whole day. That is a story about how I am patient."
13, "There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist we got there and we sat down. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. Its like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and proffessional. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future."

18, "A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didn’t even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didn’t lose my patience."
18, "One of the worst fellings in the world is that your flight has been canceled .This has happens to many people but only one family in my family. My cousins were going to come to @LOCATION1 for chrismas. Cara and I where texting and e-mailing each other about what we where going to do while they where in @LOCATION1. They have been planning this since @DATE1, but now their night was conclled! We where so mad! My cousins family had to be so patence because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle @LOCATION2. My grandma had a good idea, for them! To get on the next fight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @NUM1 and it would take I them two hours to get here. When they got here I was at the airport waiting .When I saw my cousin she said “everyone was so patient but me!” I expected the exact oposite but, no! I thought that my cousin, carn would be the patient one but I was wrong, but at least some one was pacient."
11, "People with patients are great teachers my mom is one of those great leader she has a great level of patients she has a family and many responsibilities. When we  ask for things over and over again she doesn`t get angry and out bust she just says no or yes you @MONTH1 with a smile or when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complains she just keeps a smile on her face and finishes the rest of the adventures day. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains. My mom is very patient women and a great teacher and leader. I apreciates everything she does for me, my brother, and dad."
21, "I remember I had to use @CAPS10 sisters old phone. The @CAPS1 pearl. @CAPS2 was really slow @CAPS2 dropped calls,and I was @CAPS3 horrible. @CAPS10 birthday was coming up, and I reall needed a haw one. and I asked @CAPS10 mom @CAPS4 I was going to get one for @CAPS10 birthday. She said “@CAPS5. Be paitent,” And  I really wanted to know so I kept asking her, and she said probably not. But I didn’t give up. I  was really patient until @CAPS10 birthday. When I woke up, I saw presents on the kitchen table! @CAPS10 family watched me open them. When I had one left, I opend @CAPS2. Iwas a huge box! and I opend  @CAPS2 to find another box. and another  and another,  and another. Finally @CAPS2 was at the smallest one. I pened @CAPS2 and the side, of the box said, iphone on @CAPS2 !! I got an iphone @NUM1! I was so happy! “@CAPS9 what you get for being patient.” @CAPS10 mom said with a smile."
12, "I’m writing a story about patience. Patience in can say like I’m waiting for you to get done with whatever your doing. Something like the o, say @CAPS1 been waiting for the kids to be quite. And they can’t so even though she’s getting mad, she still being patient with us instead of saying get out my class giving us chance after chance. Because she want us to be good and stay in class."
16, "A time when I was patience was during a time I was with my mom and she decided “lets make some cookes” so we got all the cookes ready. They looked so good eaven thow they werent cooked. My mom just ??? go to the oven for @NUM1 minets! I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take there shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft my mougnt wasted I wanted them now. The timer buzed @CAPS1 over there, grabed a hot pad and almost through them out of the oven! Right as I was about to get one my mom snarped “they need to cool in on”. She set the timer for @NUM2 minets! I did not think I could wait that long. My magnt waterd at the small. I was dying I wanted them so bad! I thought the smell could kill me! Every minet semed like an houre. Then the timer buzed I sprinted, over ther, grabed a plate tossed @NUM3 of the bigest cookes on the plate, while doing so I burned my hand. But I did not care I took a bite out of a cooke my water was over. My patieates payed off in the end I t was so word in it for the cookes I got."
21, "Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you”@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasn’t enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really don’t like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So that’s a good thing. Idon’t know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient."
24, "In @CAPS1 middle school, in @PERSON2's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named @CAPS2 and another named @CAPS3 were cleaning the mess @CAPS7 made earlier, from their mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 was trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to figure out what could calm them down. @CAPS7 DO have @CAPS4 though…  @CAPS5 @PERSON2. Often she wondered what went though their minds when @CAPS7 got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never understood. When @CAPS7 did wrong things, @CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong. @CAPS7 progressed @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, ""@CAPS6 patient, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn eventually."" @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 as the months passed, @PERSON1 believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when @CAPS7 did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon, by the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 were @CAPS11- plus students. @CAPS7 had passed @PERSON1's class. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husbands office. She @CAPS12 him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replied was "" @CAPS12 you so!"""
24, "I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dad’s house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don’t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it’s implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??"
24, "Are you a patient person? Well I’m not! Well, I can be patient I just won’t like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since they’re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. it’s hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn’t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is."

17, "I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he should’ve realized I wouldn’t just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, I’d go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn’t so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That’s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him."
10, "One day, I had to be patient why cause I had ask my mother can I go skate but she told me to be patient so we wait and till she said yea. After wait we was mad cause my mother had to go get the money for my sister. So next awayz be patient but if you do not be patient you will not get your wayz. Like one day my sister haven and I want to go to the movie with our friends so we had to be patient for a whole hour why cause we had to wait and till mom got off of work for she can give haven @MONEY1 and me @CAPS1 @MONEY1. So that is how you be patient."
24, "Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, you’re time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman – @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didn’t even see it, truth be told I’m not even sure if it happen but you can’t argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn’t took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didn’t a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! Nobody‘s perfect, you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point!"
16, "Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremly still and quiets did you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a musle all the turkeys will run away. Some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was  hunting with my dad @CAPS1 sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when I had a shot my dad scared them all away but I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. That is my example of patience."
15, "One day, two years ago I was going to visit the @ORGANIZATION1 train @CAPS1 was a @NUM1 hour wait once we got to the froun of the line we haD to go pack to the end because my mom forgot the tickets so how we had to wait 21/@NUM1 hours to get to the begining once we got there the gay told us that we could of told him our name and he coulD of founD our tickes on line my mom got really maD but we got to go on the @ORGANIZATION1 train wich was really fun. thats the time I haD to @CAPS2 pachiant for over @NUM3 house hanDing in extreme heat."
21, "Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadn’t heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little it’s been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn’t have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The @CAPS3."
16, When I was patient I was sitting at a restront. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patient’s. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal thes time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had. And thats when I was very patient.
19, "Last @DATE1, while I was up at my families within my seep dad, taught my brothers, friends and I how to wares. It being the dareful am not really, I tied first. Using all the steps my step dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake] I got up on my skills just like @CAPS1! No I could make all! In when the water level end came around and I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted her to cry water at ring. But when we got out to the lake, and I had skilled a few times in a lowest was up to here to decide if she was going to try skilling for sure. We sat there for what seems hill an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn’t try to persuade was of pitch him into trying it. I was very patience with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I will not proud of myself to this day, for what I did on that boat."
11, "When I was @NUM1 years old my mom use to be unpatient all the time and got so annoyed at! But then one day she was going to take a shower but then people kept on going and she got patient for a while and I got up there. I saw her and hide. As I peeked from end to end she was still standing there, almost falling asleep and she was still patience. Another stepped in the bathroom and I quickly went there and said “@CAPS1, excuse me but my mom is coming, she’s been waiting. So I woke up my mom “mom, mom wake up go take a shower!” and she woke up and took a shower, after she came out “ahh” it kind of feel good” that was better.” The end."
17, "It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and we were up @ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to go on the boat and go tubeing. We vent cared out to the boat and go all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @CAPS1 and cousin took the back of the seats off and peared in the back, there was boat-roads of water the birage pump had stopped working. My step-dad took a look at them and said that it was going to be re-wired. He had soon re-wired the boat and it sill hadn’t worked all the kide were now getting antsy. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody had now calmed down and walked away. Pretty soon we heard a boat start up that sounded like my @CAPS1’s we ran down there with excitement and sure enough it was started we hoped in and there we went tubing down the river. Later that day my mom had said to me “patince is a virtue.”"
22, "I’m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I’m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked “@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?” @CAPS2 responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?” @CAPS2 replies “@CAPS4, @CAPS9?” I answered “@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with”. “@CAPS6.” @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there’re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said “@CAPS8, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “@CAPS9?,’ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper “because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.”"
16, "Every year me and my entire family take a trip to @LOCATION2 to the @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad,(???). my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year."
22, "I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day."
23, "Why wasn’t my uncle there yet? Come on! I was saying there hade trapped bet up my back, falop used into the ?? and the only thingi had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was uncle @PERSON1 @CAPS1 all I quick I’ll look back to see what was wrong: I was at uncles house waiting for him to hurry up so could go hunting. I douln’t wait. Opening the ?? door very quite  and ?? out with my @NUM1. Guage, I then ran out into work ans into my tree stand. We had had this stad for as long ?? could remember. That I now see – was a bad thing. The ladder was ? and we felt like it would break. The top bowed and break quite a few time in different spot. We kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it. So after climbing up the ladder I let the ? to my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience but I didn’t need any. There standing on the horizon of tree, was the biggest buck I had ever seen, I almost said it was so beautiful. Loading a stud into the barrel I took aim ?? Boom I shoti zzz+++! I missed luck! The stud tilted to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on ??  ?? sown and even the edge. The gun landed bend ?? I turned even to see the stud coming down.

The stud fell into my ?? were trapped beneath my back I tried to move but my back hurt too bad and my ?? were starting to bleed.i was luck I didn’t break my neck and so my problem esd I wasn’t patient at first. But I learned my lesson and wanted andwas patient enough to wait until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, and learned the hard way to be patient"

10, "Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life."
18, Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.
17, "I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasn’t even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didn’t have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to @LOCATION1 that weeket, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin’s house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient."
18, "One christmas about a year or two ago we drove up to my grandparents house. They live in cold water so it took about @NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my dads side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn`t wait to open. The parents were just talking about nonsense, so I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now,” we stated to open the presents but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gifts openers ever I was about to rip the presents out of their hand`s and open the presents I didn`t do that thought because I was being patient. After they finished I said,”yes” of course thought my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you they aren`t fast at all either. After that I finally got to open my presents. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient."
11, I am writing about when someone was patient. My mom was patient when she did get if her money that day. She wanted it to come but it did so she was mad for a min but the next day it came. And I said I tell you mommy it was coming to day. did I get when money yes did bee ??? Yould her to was. That one day but I did no where so do when it.

22, "I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didn’t really went to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ‘backyard’. I flung my fishing lips into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things.) The finally started to unravel. Excited, I kept out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the real. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new."
24, "@CAPS11 was @DATE1. @CAPS11 was almost time for @CAPS1 birthday. @PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was helping his @CAPS6 made his birthday cake. After they were done making the cake mix, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 put @CAPS11 on into a cake pan. She put the pan into the oven for @NUM1 hours. "I can't wait for my sufer yammy chocolate birthday cake to be done!' said @PERSON1. A 'few minutes later @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready.

" " @CAPS8, " said @PERSON1, " I 'll go do something else.' @CAPS9 @PERSON1 went down stairs to play his video games. When he was done play his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time has gone by. There was two hour and thirty minutes left. @CAPS9 @PERSON1 decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and got on his two wheeler bycicle. He went for a ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride @PERSON1 asked if them if they want to go play in the sand box. They all said yes. @CAPS9 they went to the backyard and played in the sand box. @PERSON1 and his friends all made this huge sand kingdom. @CAPS11 had big castles and @CAPS11 had a trench all around @CAPS11. @CAPS11 took up the entire sand box. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven." @CAPS6 how much time is on the oven?"  asked @PERSON1 " Only five more minutes ," said his @CAPS6, " you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in @CAPS11. And when your done you can invite them in for a piece of cake. When @PERSON1 and his friends were done getting the sand off of them they all went inside and hold a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake they all said," @CAPS11's the best cake ever!""

13, I was patient when I was going to the docteis to get???  ??? I didn’t complan about it. I had to wait for @NUM1 hours. Then when I went in thay toke a couple of ways it toke about @NUM2 hour. Then thay take some tests then at the end I finally went home. That was the time I was patient.
16, One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods @NUM1 or earlier. When we got there we found a spot to sit on the ground. We were goin  to stay in the woods till dark or we kill our limit of deer. When it was or @NUM2 ½  hour till dark we seen a dow but when we moved the gun to shoot it it ran. We stade not moving or talkin  waitin. Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When their was like @NUM3 minutes left till dark a good size dow came. It was to far away tho  so we waited for it to get closer  the boom the rifle goes off. It dropped but it was still alive laying down. We waited like @NUM4 or  more minutes then it died. That was one of the times  I was patient.
12, I had to be patient when I really wanted a @CAPS1 bike crank and I had to make money for it so I went to @CAPS2 houses picking leaves till I showed them shouveling drive ways. In @CAPS3 time I had the money for my @CAPS1 bike. It was hard to be patient but in the end it payed off.
15, The time I had @NUM1 be patient was when I was at my first foot ball game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied in the @NUM2 to @NUM2 and it was the @DATE1 and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball he tumlied and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient I wouldn't have won the game cause the coach wouldn't have put me ind that was the time I was patient.
16, "A time when I was patient well it didn’t just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just don’t go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I don’t complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what."
14, "You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to???P A last @DATE1. I had to be patient to @NUM1 hours before me and my family arrived. The next day I had to be more patient because we went to an amuesmed park. There I had to wait in very long lines,’@CAPS1 is really hard to be patient. Is @CAPS1 hard for you to be patient. That’s the story when I had patience."
7, I am always patient person until I sit for hours then I can oh patient person. My mom is patient too especially  at the look were she work’s . A lot of people we very rude to her.
16, "One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were writing in line to put school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took areand @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barly got our things that day, but because we were patient, we did."
16, "Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didn’t because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait."
20, "A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad. I had to get my shots because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didn’t want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.  They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over."
7, In my own words patience is when you have to just be com and quiet. And not all hyper and annoying. Patience is just controling yourself. And not being all rude and disrespectful to others.
6, I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are.
14, "One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, I’m very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient"
16, A time that I was patience was last @DATE1 when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. I was at the begging at the line and then I saw a sign that @CAPS3 two hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign so for me and my family and the other people that were in the same spot as us we must likely have to wait at lest two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day out and I was wearing black which probably wasn’t the smartest @CAPS4. So I was waiting in line for about an hour only I just couldn’t take standing in that hot wheather anymore but I really wanted to rive that rine so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patent then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then the line just seemed like people left for me that was good cause then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a line that I was paitent.
18, "awhile back, my best friend @PERSON1’s grandpa died. They weren’t blood related but they were really close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1, and her sister @CAPS1 force a smile toward us. @CAPS1 left to go talk to my parents. Then ,@PERSON1 started crying, that she wouldn’t see her grandpa’s gravestone, because they were moving  to @LOCATION1. She changed subjects, about the good times she had with her grandpa. I lauged and smiled with @PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to chuch. I hugged her and told her everything would be alright. She smiled ,”many contrary . “@PERSON1’s eyes filled with tears, “I don’t want to move to @LOCATION1. “@CAPS2 weeks later, she did with her family."
8, I was patient when my mom go to the stor she will go in the stor and get a basket she will take aill day in that stor in she will come out that stor with a basket fill up to the basket in I will be patient then she will go to a new stor do it agin
16, "Onece, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do."
14, "So you want a story about being patient well your in lack. So the story starts off with me at the doctor’s office so I’m waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours so so @NUM1 @CAPS1 I’ll read something. So I’m reading and all I here is wineing oho screaming so I ??? ono yes. But not mad. I get the kid to stop crying and mom to stop screaming, so I was happy. There my sister cheris comes up and screams in my ear I was really annoyed but not mad so I just got another ??? then my mom says it’ll be another hour. I was so mad I screamed. This is true and I was pre patient"
13, "When I was patient I remember writing an article at sea world when I  was very little. I didn’t complain because I knew I would get those sometimes my sister was complaining being she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for @NUM1 minutes for a role called @CAPS1 drop, or something like that I can’t remember. Then there was a line at the ??? for ???. We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time for every to get out."
23, My mom’s in the hospital! My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life-threting surgery. This is a story of a time I was of a time I was patient. My mom didn’t feel good for two years. And when she whent to the doctors for a “cheak-up” it turned out she had heart disease @NUM1 main artary block ages. So I had to wait while she was getting  “preped”. It took two hours which felt like forever! Then I got to see her for five minutes then she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patients and it payed off.
20, A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next @NUM1 minutes. I was patient throuout this time because if wasn’t I might’ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.
22, "I am in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps .When I packed my things in the truck I had wait in a @NUM1 hour car ride till I get to my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that fit five people we were fitting @NUM2 people in it, I was the one stuck in the back with all the gour. Some ones sea bag had a boat in it that was stabling in my back I tried so hard not to complain about it, it took all my patience to last half the way there till I had to move the boot in my bay I grabbed the bag that had the boot in it and there wit to the other side. When  I thought all was well @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started sighing at very annoying song I didn’t  think my patient could handle staying in that torch with their sighing .Finally we were at port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stop sighing and my patience had held through. But then there was the cheat in line their were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 at me waiting to check I’d had a feeling my patience was gonna blow up and I’d go crazy. But it didn’t I stayed there patiently until it was any turn to check in, sadly the officer at the check in desk was old and talked very slown it was so hard understanding what he was saying. I finally was checked in my patience had survived!!Then I found out my friend logon was banked up gave me. Which he can be very annoying.” @CAPS4 boy I thought,” here comes another test ror my patiences. My patience was tested through the as ride, the clean in line, and also through that whole training. But my patience was very strong and survived!!!"
13, "To dieited to wright about a time when I was pacent. One time when we, went to @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2. My family and I couldn’t wate to go on the @ORGANIZATION3.

At @NUM5 we went up the hill and was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over my patience payed off and @CAPS4 always patient because of the cedar point dragster."
17, "“@CAPS1 another @NUM1 days ill be on my way to cedar point. I wonder what we’ll do when we first get there? What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can talk my mom into going on the trip @NUM1 days early?” “@CAPS2 mom” said @PERSON1. “@CAPS3” said her mother.” “@CAPS4 we @CAPS1 go to ???? point now?” “@CAPS5 sweetie our tickets are for on @DATE1 your @CAPS1 going to have to be patient.” “ok i’ll do my best.” “ata girl”! As @PERSON1 was on her way up to her room she was thinking that maybe if she tried getting her mind off of it she would forget. So to do this she called her friend @CAPS6 to see if she wanted to come over. @CAPS6 said @CAPS3! “@CAPS7” went the doorbell. “@CAPS2 @CAPS6 wanna go play in my room?” “or”. @CAPS10 that night @CAPS6 went home and @PERSON1 wentt to bed. @NUM3 days @CAPS10.

So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up.

As many thing I did as  a chid, and still some hour my mom just calm her  self down like we didn’t even do anything. it’s kinda funny how much patient  she  has. Along time ago.

My mom being @CAPS4 patient.” @CAPS4 what`s for breakfast??.” in a high piten voice. I will get on it” she said will taking out my breakfast.  I love my momo."
16, "I’m not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I’ve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn’t complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn’t too bad. that was one of the few times I’ve been  patient, and don’t know if it counts since I was with somebody."
24, "AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1 I’m going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. @CAPS5 up, @CAPS5 in the shower, @CAPS5 dressed, @CAPS7 to school. Today @DATE1, @CAPS8 are going to my parents’ house and @CAPS7 online to see when it opens .@CAPS8 found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So @CAPS8 cheak it out and its nearby so @CAPS8 are so read to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle tooken away. Today is the day @CAPS8 are on the road but what @CAPS8 did realize was how many people would be there. When @CAPS8 got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! @CAPS8 sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting @CAPS8 were in the to @NUM7. It was just own luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but @CAPS8 were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to @CAPS7 use the rest room so @CAPS8, walk across the  street so he could @CAPS7 then when @CAPS8 came back @CAPS8 ended up in the top @NUM9!@CAPS8 waited another @NUM10 then @CAPS8 were in! By the time @CAPS8 were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants ( he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn’t do anything ,@CAPS8 had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if @CAPS8 were not so patient."
19, "Patience is an important thing to have. If helps you and other respect yourself. If you are not patient things will only get worse. My cousin is a big @PERSON1 fan. She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She didn’t know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets. Patients will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be @NUM2 patient person, and maybe I will get concert tickets someday."
13, "“ @CAPS1 day I was patient at a water park & I was get @CAPS1 a water slide.,but thier were like @NUM1 people in front of me. At the same time, I it hot then I don’t know what, I the ground his hot if you have no flip flops. But, I really want to get @CAPS1 this water slide no matter what. So I stand thier patiently to get @CAPS1 the water slide. Then I said to my self this better be wroth if or im going to be ferious. But it’ @CAPS2 I gonna be pantient about it. I hope I have fun @CAPS1 this ride."
7, "Patience is when you can wait for a long pereied and not complain I don’t think I have very much patience. I think patience is like waiting in a line for hour’s and not careing because you are very patinct but every thing takes patience games, driveing, eating waiting and even being at school all taken lot of patience."
9, I was patient when my mom when to the doctors and she was having a baby and I had to wait in the waiting room for @NUM1 hour for ???.
16, "Patience, it’s something that my family doesn’t have. Here is the story. Wile am doing the dishes my little brother is crying cause my little sister @PERSON2 hit him. So sence @CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So then my step dad is playing on his iphone. He is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know he does. Okay you think it’s going to get better? Nope wrong. I get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just won’t so l call @PERSON2 in here and @CAPS1 got to hit her then my step dad starts to go crazy cause he is still crying now @PERSON2 is being a brat stomping of the stairs. When ??? got ??? calm down. Now just as l am about to go crazy @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 down stairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day well l guess my family does have patience well not my step dad."
24, "Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly."
16, "My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for “@CAPS1” to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldn’t wait to go but I remembered to be “patient”.  The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to “@LOCATION2” when were in the car on our way there I couldn’t wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldn’t wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.  I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states."
17, "Patience is something is most people don’t have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didn’t have patience in the story, I don’t know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I don’t, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn’t out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didn’t let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasn’t mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story."
11, "My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday.He goes to work and can’t want to come home, but he doesn’t go crazy  like me cause I wanna leave. No ,he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad always been a patient person andto look  up to him because of that patience ."
14, "Patience is a very diffult thing @CAPS1 some people. One time I was at a huge party. But none of my friends or cousins were there. I was board the whole time. I asked my mom if we can go home she said ""no"". Then I sat down I waited and waited @CAPS1 a really long time. Then finally we went home. The next day my mom sent me over to my cousins house @CAPS1 a sleep over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You recieve good when you be patient."
13, "Once there was a lonely puppy. One day he sent letter to a random address and waited and waited and waited. A few weeks later he got a reply to his letter, it was from another puppy! They soon became best friends and the puppy learned that patients pays off (ussaly). The @CAPS1"
17, "I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, “@CAPS1” @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn’t that bad after all!”"
12, Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when I’m at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored.
16, "I was patient one time, really patient but kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 and my mom a I went shoping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into target, and I already knew what I was going  to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 it was perfect. But my mom wouldn’t let me buy  so I just bought him a target gift card for @MONEY1 i had to hide it for almost a month, but i really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, but she wouldn’t tell me so I  had to be patient. And when @CAPS1 came I was so suprised because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother."
14, "The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball she’ll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames."
14, When I had to go get my check up with my asma or and a familiar way like that when I had been waiting in the waiting room wich had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn’t call your name yet. So I had gotton myself busy with crossword puzzles and looking at the fishes wich were awesome cause they had different kinds of fish. And then mostly I had read my book cause I am a reader at the same time a writer but I mostly I had read my book when the doctor came in finally to call my name but I was still busy doing activities then he had said he was sorry a bout  the wait which took a while and just said it had been fine and he seen all of the stuff I had been doing while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others so I can get good compliment which makes me fell really good with a smile on the face. And ever since I see that exact doctor who I had do appointment with he always give me a treat or sitters. But to me it doesn’t matter as long as I am treating other people fair usually great. Because people would love to be like you one day for having patience.
12, One time I was getting a cool @CAPS1 game it was sooo awsome. And my mom said we will get it on fri. It was @DATE1 and was soo part for her to get of work. And she got home and said we well go on stater day. I was a little mad. Bat how cares.But yea we got the game on the next startday I could’t believe  i was patient
22, "I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. They’re so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  I’m not the most patient person, so that’s probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long ‘story about patience. “Do we have to go?” I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. “@CAPS1 its @PERSON1’s wedding and it’s important.” “@CAPS2.” I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. “@CAPS3 on!” @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. “@CAPS5?” @CAPS4 mom answered. “@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,”  “@CAPS8. That’s bad. We’re in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?”  “@CAPS10, but I’m sure you’ll make it in time to be there,”  “@CAPS11. That’s good. @CAPS12.” “@CAPS12.” @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. “@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?” @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home. “@CAPS16? I asked.” @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16.”  “@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type.” “@CAPS1” I said and I was proud."
15, "A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!"
