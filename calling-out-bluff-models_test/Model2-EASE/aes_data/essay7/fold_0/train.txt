16, Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that’s when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.
10, "I think patience is a time when you have to be calm. It is also a time of wateing. For some people being patient is extremely hard. But for me it’s easy. At times I can be inpatient, but everyone can be. Being patient is kinda new racking, but I manage. A lot of times I get mad if I have to be too patient. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don’t like to be patient. with patience comes a reward is you are really patient!"
16, You know that life is so much harder when you don’t have the patients. If you don’t then I’m going to tell you why. There was a time that found out I was going to @LOCATION1 now that’s the good part but when I ask “how are we getting there?” we had to fly and right then and there I knew I was going to have to be very patient and I thought I didn’t have enough patients to fly to @LOCATION1. Although I got through it. Now the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1 it was very hot out. We had to stand outside to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patients and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn’t want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my sences and I start out it was why easier to wait and the bus eventaly showed up and I already felt way better.
17, "A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. I was super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were geting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they steped us because the ride wasen’t working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. “I’m so happy we waited” said @PERSON1 my best firend. Some people have patient like  @PERSON1 and I, and some don’t like the the people who ran of there. I’m glade we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patient was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I."
10, When I was patient. Was when I go down the river with my dad and my two sisters (@CAPS1 @MONEY1).The only way I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to @LOCATION1. So I have no chose to be patient because it is a two houre trip. But there is a train track brige that my dad least use @CAPS2 off of and tack a brake and eat some lunch and the brige is about one houre ride down the river if you realy all the way but whe just me and my dad go we just slot the hole way.
18, "One time when I was patient was when me and my family, went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1.  Once we got on the boat it took @NUM1 minutes to go through the river. Then at @NUM2 we just waited, trolling through the water. Rocking side to side like a baby in its crib. Setting up all the poles and tures. Then around @NUM3 we got our first hit. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reaching as fast as he could. Eventually he got it in it was a, @ORGANIZATION1 at @MONEY1. Then around @NUM4, another pole got a hit I rushed over grabbed the pole and started realing it in. With some help my fish turned out to be a king @ORGANIZATION1 that came in at @NUM5. and @NUM6 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient. You never know  what’s  going to happen if you are patient."
16, "A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldn’t wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandma’s cottage I didn’t complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient don’t go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person."
16, "Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important."
9, When I was patient. I was patient once or twice. One time was when I had to use the phone but my mom was on it. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time was when I wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. So I was patient while my mom got everybody ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1.
16, "If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? In this situation I would ask for patients. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sister and I boreded @CAPS1 to florda. It seemed like we were sitting on the @CAPS1 for hours befor it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all at the people just sitting there some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then."
17, "There are many times when l’ve been patient but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon my family & I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always I didn’t know what I was going to wear, about an hour later I found what I was going to wear. I went down stairs to the soon no one was ready & we only had @NUM1 1/@NUM1 an hour left. I was frustrated told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn’t care so I went up to fore a shower right  when was as out to go in my mom come and told me I had to wait ??? She took a shower. Then one by one everyone took a shower except for me. I was loosing my patients. I still waited because I didn’t want to start a commotion. Finally I went into take a shower. We were all dressed & ready to go. At the last minutes when we all got in the car, my sister for got her bag & jacket so we had to wait till she got it. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few exam pies of me showing patients is when I waited to take a or over when in waited for my sister to got her lay a jacket."
24, "One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you  are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didn’t blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldn’t have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you."
12, "Patience, what do you think when you hear that word? When I was little I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was pat in a cast and on crutches for four months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say “patience is vertue,” have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well its really just the ability to control your self, you have to be able to get through tough situations and still be controlling yourself, and you really have to control yourself when people annoy you of things take awhile"
8, One time his years is seem a lay that was at the front of the lunch line and he was just about to go in but he had to go to the in because he wasn't all the way in the line. As he got sent to the in he had got mad but he went to the in but he was patient she didn't advice and next thing the new he was at the front of the line. I think that being patience mean when you are calm and you don't rush things and next thing you no you would be the next one
23, A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a @DATE1 when I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slide. My little brother came running over their and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. when my brother returned he asked “where do I go?” And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone I was trying to be patient when  he got back he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like along time to me. When he called my name my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked “what brings you here?” we told him the news and he took into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and annoced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crushes and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you!
17, "One time when I was patient was when there was a twenty two hour corride to florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents. It was very boring. I was sitting in the back with my sister, and we kept fighting for foot space. Around five hours in, I was feeling cramped. We stopped off for dinner, then were on the road again. When it started to become night, the road froze and we stopped off and slept in the car. We woke up during sunrise and went to cracker barrel for breakfest. It was delicious. Then we got back into the car and drove the rest of the way to florida. It @MONTH1 have been a long drive, but it was worth it."
21, "Some people say that if somebody’s trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It’s really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides he’s going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didn’t really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didn’t have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn’t always work."
24, "I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the wii. For @CAPS5 had just come and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was comoletely doctor and had advanced graphics.  I had informed  @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately.  ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guarenteed me.  ""@CAPS3! Thanc you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within  @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on dissapoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to  the months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. After appioximontly one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally and, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your wii"""". At that very moment. I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited  I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediatly. ""That's what you @CAPS14."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned  @CAPS5 pays off when your patient."

21, I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didn’t keep my mouth shut so my mom didn’t want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That’s exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.
15, "“@CAPS1 story of patient” One time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS2 for a check-up. Me and @CAPS1 dad have wait in the lobby for ?? time, after every ?? went in for the appointments. I couldn’t take it no more, but he made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad but instead I held it in. So finally we went in I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. That’s @CAPS1 story about patience."
20, "A time when I was patient was when my favorit @ORGANIZATION1 of the year comes, the @ORGANIZATION1. I had waited patiently all year counting down the days till @DATE1 reading books and homework where almost done with for another year. You could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last @ORGANIZATION1 of school. As the hours went by @ORGANIZATION1, seconds, @CAPS1 , @ORGANIZATION2, every one grew restless, but I was patient; I sat, I waited, I listened, I read, but nothing  compared to hot final moment where the bell round and the students cheered. A smile on everyone’s faces as they left the door for the final time that year."

19, "“@CAPS1” @CAPS2 my teacher said “@CAPS3 we are starting the meap test!” “uhhh” the @CAPS2 sighed exactly at the same time. After teache passed out our booklets we filled in information, wrote our names and begain. As the test dragged on I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow. I was bored! Nothing to do but sit down. I wanted to complain but I decided not to for the sake of my @CAPS2, finally part @NUM1 was finished. “Time for part @NUM2 @CAPS2!” exlamed teacher. “oh you’ve got to be kidding me I said to myself. Part @NUM2 was short, but it took one kid @NUM4 mins! At the end of the day teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year my meap results came in and they were fantastic!"
17, "Crash. Boom! Oh no theres a accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 traffic stops. “we cant stop. not now,”  yells my younger sister.” I m gonna be late for dance class. Oh @PERSON1 just be patient this traffic will be moving before you know it.” I said. As minutes passed @PERSON1 has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to wait but she replies, “I don’t want to wait.” I sat and look out the window silently because that’s all I really could do. @PERSON1 screams,” I have to go to the bathroom.” ”@PERSON1, I said please just be patient.” I gave her a candy that just only shut her up for a couple of minutes. @NUM1 minutes passed and sister is fast asleep .I asked mom when does she think the traffic is going to blow over. She told me she have no @NUM2 minutes later the traffic starts to move but stops then starts to move again. Finally we arrived to our exit and my sister makes it to the dance class. She got out of the car dashed into the studio .That was a time I was patient."
16, "About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes later… I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasn’t worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient."
24, "This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @LOCATION1.There was a huge camp ground were you can reserve an area and camp there.The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away. So i packed a magazine, some  paper my @CAPS1 and decided the best of it. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didn’t know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids!” “@CAPS3!” @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it. But the ride home seemed alot quicker. Tthat is the story of a time I was patient"
9, This is a story about one time I when my mom was patient. One time me and my mom was at the clinic ?? to get my medicin. We where one of the first people there. Then a lot more people started to come. My mom thought we where the first people to get called we weren’t @NUM1 groups where called then @NUM1 more groups got called. @NUM3 more groups got called. Then me and my mom finally got called and that was story of the time when my mom was patient.
18, "Have you ever learn spritarnt just one turns in your life. I have let ??? you about it. One day I was at home watching too .all of a sudden I had to use the bathroom really bad. Unfortunately they my momma and my sisters had to go. My momma went first and my sister was going next. My momma didn’t take very long but my sister was in there while and I was getting mad but l still was waiting patiently. It was holding it in but I knew eventually I new that it was going to come out eventually, but just waiting. I was doing all I can to get in  the bathroom. I was banging on the door trying to just the back and I wait in the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a time that I was patient."
18, "Patience is a virture. It’s something that we all need in life. Without it we can’t do anything that patience. People would get boring because they have no patience. Now, here’s a time I was patient. After @DATE1, I decided to buy on ipod touch. Since no stores were open, I had only one  other option. Online shopping. I used omazon to get it. I couldn’t wait to yet it! Unfortunetly I had to wait like a week to get it. It was boring waiting for it, but I had other things to occupy my mind. When it finally come, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From the patience, I learned you cant get everything rite away, I learned that people who wait, good things will come to them.Also I was better at waiting for everything. That’s how I was patient and have bin better at being patient."
22, "The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the plane’s wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3."
15, When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While I was in line I started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it was just seemed like the line wasn’t moving at all! Finally we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited. Being patient payed off because if I would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mat at me. I had a lot of fun after I got into then concert. That was a time that I was patient.
17, "A time I was patient is when I took @CAPS19 @CAPS1. @CAPS7 @CAPS2 test. It took two days to take the @CAPS3. @CAPS19 @CAPS3 was on @DATE1 and @DATE2, @CAPS5 @NUM1 to about @NUM2 pm.

20, "One day I had to wait about @NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didn’t complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom terted her freind. About three people got called in fourty- five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid who’s name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I don’t know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, “I have not a clue”."
21, As I walked down the lane looking for the perfect gift I saw the day before. I find out it was sold out. Today was my mom’s birthday and I find the gift. The perfect gift a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager  if fact had any in the back sadly they didn’t. He said “The new shipment should be arriving at five”. I didn’t think I could wait another three hours. My dad drove me home. I was pacing back and forth thinking it would occupies sadly it didn’t. Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I know if the time was five and my dad and I went back at the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I picked it up and give it to the clerk to scan. I hand her the money and head strait home. When mom get home I hand mom the gift and realize patient come in handy when it comes to waiting.
16, "Patience. My cousin ??? most patient person I have ever met. @LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he must go through eight years of college. Eight years of termanology, teaching cells, learning human anology he has to be patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1 which is pretty close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home a lot and never complain about homework or school or anything has got the highest patient ??? trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college which means four down four to go. He doesn’t have a certain way of taking stress out besides the fact he squeezes his??? It’s not easy being motivated and relaxed ??? does that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1 he told me patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient."

Her and her boyfriend zone, were playing to go sky diving so me, my friend,, and my parents taged along to watch. We had a couple people in front of them so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passes. Still not even close to being there turn. We were starting to get hungrey so we went into town and order some breakfast, we got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancle our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not there turn. I don't really know how but something happened to wide we had sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally there turn, they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while and then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a succes. @CAPS1 turns out that we sat there for eight hours befor they jumped. Not including the hour and a half drive there .I think that I was pretty patient that day."
24, "I know a girl, she’s my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her-home work, and has straigt A’s. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a saterday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to @CAPS2 the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, “@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.” @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. “@CAPS2 over it you potato sak,” I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, “@PERSON2, we gotta @CAPS2 to that counter before I explode!” I looked at her with my, why don’t you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 through out the night making sure she didn’t go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn’t @CAPS2 kicked out. You should always @CAPS1 patient or things @MONTH1 turn out bad."

It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal. There only a couple people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had see to this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple minutes passed old I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back."

14, "Being patient means waiting, when one of my brothers was patience. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew ther if I was patient everything would come out good. So we were waiting we had to bail him at before @NUM1 o’clock. We were theire since @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was very nervous. I told her many time to calm down everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren’t bailing out at that time that maybe around @NUM3. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was @NUM4 o clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to @NUM1 different stores and they said we couldn’t cash it. So we went to the chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother."
13, "There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said it’s a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didn’t get them because @PERSON1 didn’t like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didn’t want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said don’t go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1."

But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom “report cards didn’t come out yet”. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and “I told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2”. but “if you dant wanna get in trouble then yeah” And she said. When her mom asked her “did the report cards come out”. She said “yeah” then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. That’s a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble."

When I showed that fish to my dad he about fainted and the same with me, my mom and my little brother cody. And right now that fish is at the tax adermy."
16, I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I’ve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o’clock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn’t even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.
13, A time when I was patient was when I was at school. I was waiting for my sience teacher to call on me to get ready to go. I was siting down in my seat. She was calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class.
16, "Don't you ever whis ever one in the world would be patience, @CAPS4 if you don't I do.

20, "It was a bright sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn’t seem to complain, he was very patient. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, and there was a riot going on, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently. It has now been twelve hours, people begain to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet move. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. There flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towared it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. The end."
17, "@PERSON1 was swinging with her friend all day when she was swinging so high that the chain came loose and @PERSON1 fell, she was screaming in pain. So they waked in the house. When they got to the house @PERSON1 was screaming and crying they all got in the car and drove to the doctors. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasnâ€™t patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her she had forgot all about why she was there, @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient."
13, "When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often @MONTH1 become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @MONTH1 be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience."
14, "One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient."
13, I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. First it started out when I got a can from my friend @PERSON1 he asked me to go. So I said yes. I had to be pation derms the @DATE1. Then he drive it way long but I was pation. When we got to the entrance I felt good for being pation.
17, "Waiting in the line to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I complained,"" @CAPS2! When are we going into the park?"". ""@CAPS3 patient,"" @CAPS9 mother hissed back. ""Being patient is boring!""I complained again ""yeah,"" shouted @CAPS9 sister. ""@CAPS4 so bored! Its not and @CAPS9 feel hurt and- ""@CAPS5!'', shouted @CAPS9 @CAPS2. ""Were almost there!"" @CAPS6 @CAPS8 seemed like hours, we @CAPS7 got to the ticket booth.""@CAPS7!"" I meaned.  We went inside the park."" @CAPS8 first?"" I asked @CAPS9 sister pointed to a ride. ""That one!"" @CAPS9 sister yelled night before she ran to a ride. We followed @CAPS9 sister to the ride."" @CAPS10, lets ride @CAPS12. It looks fun."" said @CAPS9 dad as we walked to the line."" @CAPS11! More waiting!"" I shouted"" @CAPS12 is gonna take forever!"" I complained."
13, "When I went deer hunting with my dad I was patient. When me and my dad went deer hunting I had to be patint by waiting. The hardest part was being quiet to. I also had to stay still. Being patint is waiting for some thing. I had to be patint because I was waiting for a deer all day. Even now I did not get a deer, I was quiet, still and patint."
5, Patience is eporten. Becus if you don’t haf patience you wont git that far in lif. If you don’t haf patience pepol wunt lak you at all. And yeu don’t haf patience you wont be abl to fis stuf.
6, Hunting have in patience in it. Hunting you can’t go git a deer. You got to wath. Because deers don’t come rith to you. Deer don’t like people all so deer came smell you. If you not patience you all not git nothing.
13, Last year I had to sell my cow because she was sick. I have bell weight in for eight months to get A new calf but I didn't them were I would get one untill I asked my uncle who cases @CAPS1's small cow breed witch nor mail costs @MONEY2 but he gave me a deal on her for @MONEY1. It took me eight month's to fined he. But daring those eight month's I got tenacious and I couldn't sleep very well at high that when I got her home I was happy I had found her when I did. I still wory about her at night because of the cougar that is rooming the cluntury side.
22, "Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end."
14, "When l was patient l was in the car and my mom went to get something at the store and l went whith her. I was patient because l didn’t tell her when are we gonna go home or this is @CAPS1 boring. I tried to go whith the flow. I was there for @NUM1 hour but did I care no because l was the one who wanted to come whith and l came. If l would of complained then she would of said then “why did you come.” @CAPS1 at the end my mom said since you have been patient then you can get a chocolate bar @CAPS1 if your patient, there might be a reward at the end."
20, "Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldn’t go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking “When is the ride going to be over mama” she kept responding “I don’t know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride.” @CAPS2 I couldn’t wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said “ok” and thats when I got sad then she said to me “but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy.” “I love smoothys” I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience ia a hard thing to do but once you got it, it’s a good thing to do."
16, "Over the @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1.  @CAPS2 got up early and drove to @LOCATION4 I was the firts time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patients or else the ride was going to be boring me and my sister got on the plane and flew to @LOCATION3 and it took @NUM1 minutes and that was easy but then @CAPS2 got on another plane and went directly to @PERSON1 and that took @NUM2 hours I was a very long ride but I had patient, but my sister didn't have any patients at all the whole ride she was asking which @CAPS2 were going to get there. And that was the time, I had patients."
14, "Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just can’t wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but I’m not. I’m not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I don’t think that will happen anytime soon."
22, "Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasn’t home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it."
21, "One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didn’t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldn’t stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didn’t panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn’t take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldn’t stop in time. When I hit my head it didn’t hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didn’t hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over."
18, "A time I was patience was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. The biggest water slide there. It had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. I was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. It was huge just about @NUM1 feettall. And we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. When some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. Finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. So it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on."
12, "Patience is very important, it can help you be successful in many things. In school patience is very important because some things just have to wait. Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can’t wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also on your birthday you don’t know what you’ll get but instead of peeking you have to be patient you can open the presents up. Patience is a very helpful skill to have"
24, "“@CAPS1! Today is the day we get to go to @CAPS2 point,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1 exclaimed. “@CAPS4 on @PERSON1, lets get this show at the road.” @CAPS5 announced. The @CAPS6 were planning a vacation to go to @CAPS7 point @CAPS22 @DATE1 long and today is the day they got to go. The family got @CAPS22 of their suitcases and piled them in the car. When everything was situated, they took off. “@CAPS8 @CAPS11, how long is this drive gonna take?” @CAPS9, @PERSON1’s older sister, asked.  “@CAPS10, about six hours sweetie.” @CAPS11 replied. The @CAPS6 lived in @LOCATION1, @CAPS21 they had to drive along way to get to @LOCATION2.“@CAPS13 @CAPS11!!! I can’t survive six hours in a car!!!. “@CAPS14 @CAPS9, you wanted to @CAPS4 here, you just have to have patience like @CAPS3 @PERSON1 here.”   “I guess I will not wait.” @CAPS15 about three hours in the car @CAPS9 kept repeatedly asking the question “Are we there yet?” @CAPS16 though the answer was always “@CAPS17,” she asked it anyways. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 eventually got annoyed of this and shouted “stop it! Just have some patience!”,“@CAPS18, @CAPS18,” @CAPS9 replied, “I will stop.”@CAPS15 about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children what ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said “The @CAPS20.”     @CAPS21 they walked up to the line, and waited. They just waited, and waited. Some more.  @CAPS15 what seemed like four hours waiting in line, @CAPS9 gave up and shouted “I don’t want to wait in line anymore! I am leaving!” @CAPS21 the family walked back into the car, and drove off. When they got settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, “@CAPS22 it takes is some patience and you can have some fun.”  @CAPS9 didn’t respond."
17, "One day @PERSON1’s mom, “@CAPS1” decited to go shoping and @PERSON1 despretly wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged and begged s his mom finally said, “@CAPS3 but you cant complain” so @PERSON1 went shoping with his mom. Then @PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Just about @DATE1 @PERSON1 said. “I’m board can we go now”, his mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2 just be patient. @PERSON1 then said,” patient you want me to be patient weve been here for like  @DATE1 hours”, we have only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patients said @PERSON1. So so his mom made a deal with @PERSON1 it was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1 we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 made his mom go crazy with every second @PERSON1 saying, I’m board can we go now and hurry up. Finally @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 said, “wait” we past it, his mom said I know. @PERSON1 said” we made a deal, remember. It is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said, “@CAPS2” patients is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patients in my own way."
18, "Im not a very patient person so im going to be wrighting about what patience @CAPS6. Patience @CAPS6 when you don’t complain when your board or waiting for somthing. For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please  take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied “if you could I live over @CAPS3” she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. “@CAPS3 you go,” he said. “@CAPS4 you mind helping me put them away” the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, “@CAPS6 your home unlocked” “@CAPS7 its not” she replied, where are your keys” @CAPS1 asked, “I beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush. He brought the keys to her and said “@CAPS3 you go,” she opened the door and he helped her with her grocres. When they were all put away @CAPS1 said “@CAPS11 I ought to be going.” “@CAPS11 not without somway I can repay you” said the woman “@CAPS13 go find my purse.” @CAPS1 waited and waited, it had to have been a hour. The woman came out of the kitchin with some change. “@CAPS15 its only change, I couldn’t find my wallet” she said and gave him the change. @CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @CAPS1 told his mom about his good deed and his cousin @CAPS2 got to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure your patient and know the person."
7, I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctors she was savifly six and she still waited. They can fix that problem by asking nicely can I go ahead of you plezz. That will solve every thing in a kind and respetful way. That is what I think respectful way.
20, "Someone l know that is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people l know. Especially on this certain day. Every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me… she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave."
24, "During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didn’t know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didn’t know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didn’t say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who don’t know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes won’t go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I’m not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn’t once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didn’t yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would’ve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I’m amazed at my mom’s understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too."
23, "It all started on a cold and snowy @DATE1, there was only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbows. Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off."
13, "Patience @CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having ‘’the patience’’ means that you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you gobble your food down thinking its going to he stolen, when really, you could have left it there and yet it would still there. Patience @CAPS3 knowing that everything @CAPS3 going to be ok and you have time. Having patience to do somthing, @CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 qenrally how long you can wait to do somthing, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean now long you can put up with somthing, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before your just pushed off the edge and you cant take it any more! THAT’@CAPS1 @CAPS2 PATIENCE @CAPS3."
14, "The time when I showed patient is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I want to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big, you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient is when I was going up the stairs to the slide when every body rush in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slide’s. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on fun slide. The blason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flight or stair’s with in ??? So the second time  I went up I ran up the stair’s so I could be the first one, so I did and  I still had to wait because it still people there from last time. So I waited my turn. That is the time I showed patient."
11, When I was patient I was in line at gender point for the @CAPS1 we got to cedar point late so we went to the end of the line there was a sign have way through that said “your wait will be @NUM1 hour so we stad in line for an hour finally we got to the front I was so exited as I was walking up the stairs I realized I just awaited an hour and @NUM2 minutes to ?? this and then I rode it ??? was ???
20, "When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car from the @NUM1 hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, roller @CAPS1 galore. I saw at cedar point, the amusement park. In the car we talked about the @CAPS1.  The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and leard waiting leads up to good things."
18, "Patients is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard. I m one of those people. Patients is a sort of a gift. It takes time to have patients and you can not always be in a hurry. For example, one time I heard someone talking in my basement. So I went down there to see who was in my house, @CAPS1 I was walking I heard giggling and excitement I kept on walking until I heard the voices coming from behind a door. I went to open it and I saw all kinds of gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs. So I ran up stairs to tell my brothers what I saw. They were all excited and everything. The next day went by and I could not wait until @CAPS2 the next day. So I waited"
20, "@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for a while now. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, would reply â€œYou canâ€™t get a dog until you earn it.â€� @PERSON1 didnâ€™t know how @CAPS7 earn it, she thought about it for a while she didnâ€™t really know what her @CAPS1 meant, she figured that her @CAPS1 meant that she needed @CAPS7 @CAPS8 her some responsibility. She looked at the clock it said @NUM1, almost time for dinner, she thought her @CAPS1 was probably, working on it, so she walked out @CAPS7 the kitchen & there was her @CAPS1 making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little more than loud â€œwhatâ€™s for dinner?â€�  steak & mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1â€™s favorite. She nodded & said â€œcanâ€™t help!â€� â€œwhy not?â€� her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what could she could do & her @CAPS1 said @CAPS7 get the salt & pepper @CAPS7 put on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing @CAPS7 help out. @PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs @CAPS7 her room, she was hoping her @CAPS1 would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 then she went @CAPS7 bed. The next day she ran down the stairs @CAPS7 find her @CAPS1 sitting on the coach. She said quickly â€œwhat are we doing today?â€� her @CAPS1 answered â€œI was thinking we could just hang around the house.â€� @PERSON1 was getting impatient she wanted a dog & she was trying her @CAPS6 @CAPS7 be good, then finally she last it and shouted â€œare we ever gonna get a dog???â€� her @CAPS1 surprised of @PERSON1 said â€œwellâ€¦â€¦â€� @PERSON1 interrupted â€œ@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ONE AND I @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU! â€œher @CAPS1 answered well if you were more patiet I was gonna say maybe we could go look at anneâ€� @PERSON1 felt bad for veiling & realised things will turn out better if she wailse later that day her & her @CAPS1 went and out a day."
18, A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn’@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.
13, Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It has to stay perfectly still to get it prey. It has to be patient too. Then after it gets into the wright position it patses. The cat gets its goal by being patient.
16, "Patience is a very important value. To sacced you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self- centered ,and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn’t recognize the surroundings. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life"
10, "It was @DATE1, @NUM1 my brothers birthday. He turned @NUM2 and he was makeing me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff and he kept saying no she dont have it. Then he would ask my brother be like you know I got this money for my baby. So he would keep asking people and it was getting on my nerves because when somebody say they dont have it they dont have it. I didnt say nothing I was quiet because it was his birthday but I know how to be patience when it’s something important or special. So I just was watching him and watching him and then I said here you can have my money it is your birthday so here you go. So I have gave him what he was angry and asking for and he got it I had patience because I didn’t go off him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted."
17, "A time when I was patient. The day I was patient I had a asma attack. I was veary scared. And worset of all my inhayler was broken. That is not good. So my mom ruched @CAPS2 to the doctors. The doctor gave @CAPS2 a breathing machine and then I was fine: @CAPS1 gave @CAPS2 a perscripsnion and said ""I so these whenever you feel like you cant breathe again."" I said ""ok"" @CAPS2 and my mom went to @ORGANIZATION1 and droped it off we said we would came back in one hour. I went home and fell asleep then my mom woke @CAPS2 up and said use had to go pick that up. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and they said ""hold on one moment please"" ""ok"" said my mom. We sat in the car for one note hour waiting and waiting and waiting. I was very payshent my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to go home. That day my mom was un payshent (wich is not good) so she was mad. The worker finily said"" @CAPS3 you go sorry for the ware"" my mom paid font and we left. That day I was very payshent."
16, "One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldn’t wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and saying” I’m for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like mom” and that’s about the handreth time I said that to her and she said “ you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that he’s going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn’t care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days I’m being patient I really can’t believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when I’m getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so I’m really exited. So I was on a @CAPS5 break on the last @NUM1 days antil @CAPS5 so I played video games to save up my time of being patient then the last @NUM3 days I’ve been  playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there whose only @NUM3 more days antil @CAPS5 and I just played outside intel the day was over on those last two days I even played outside with my friends on @CAPS5 eve. Then the day came @CAPS5 finaly I saw  my presents and my mom said ya open them sort starred to seen them and once I opened all my present I did not see the @CAPS3, antil my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the @CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don’t have to be patient no more, the end"
17, "Patience is not fun butt is sometimes necessary. Im going to tell you how patience is not fun.It was a calm day at school. I was waiting for the well to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ring! Ring ! Ring ! Finally I could see @CAPS1 as excited as I was I rushed out the dorr. I went to his locker and he gave me a note so I read it. It said passibly maybee I like you. I was so happy. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question. Next time you have to be patient just thing good thing come to those who wait."
14, "I always have to be patient when I put way model airplanes together. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the @CAPS1- @DATE1 on the @NUM1 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey. If I’m not patient I could mist a good shot or a good animal. I sometimes have to patient at school with @CAPS2 and other students."
11, "Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them."
6, "@PERSON1 is waiting patient when the class is talking. I the class closet at ping she will clap third time until they stop talking or quiet. When they quiet down she would continue teaching then??? @PERSON1 is talking we should be waiting patient and untill she is down talking to us. That is how @PERSON1 be patient."
10, PATIENT. One time I had to be very patient over at @CAPS1 barrymores because we went into a line to go on go-karts that yexi had to be at least @NUM1 years old or older to go. I also had to be patient my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would this cool.
16, "Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does” well that’s exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience. Everybody always woundered about her there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what she had patience. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, couldn’t wait and always bother her parents she just sat patiently. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her, patience in the store and get that pacific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted it was just lips glass five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home she was so tired and she wen’t up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait, that’s how accedents and problems happen and this little girl got every thing she wanted one thing, she had patience."

24, "Melted @CAPS1 One day @CAPS13 sister and I have just woke up one bright @DATE1 @TIME1. @CAPS5 was at @CAPS13 door. The light shinned through @CAPS13 cartains and @CAPS13 covers. @CAPS5 pushed the door open just a crack and said, “@CAPS2” “@CAPS3”, I got up moaning “@CAPS4 me up. I’m sleeping.” @CAPS5 helped me up and hugged me while I was searching, I went in to the living room. @CAPS5 were in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but @CAPS19 was aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the tv when I didn’t know @CAPS13 mom was on the coach. “@CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diver”, called ?? “@CAPS7.K.” I ??, “(@CAPS8 want to come down stairs to.” “@CAPS9” he exclaimed. “@CAPS10’ I thought in @CAPS13 head. We walked down stairs in the ??? to the laundry room when we finished putting the clothed in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” @CAPS5 look frightened and said “@CAPS9 I’m cooking something. “@CAPS13 eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @CAPS19 and @CAPS14 pushed me out side hare coms. “@CAPS10 air!” we m joined. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards @CAPS17 still on the couch sleep. We shook her and shook her but @CAPS5 didn’t wake up, so I said “cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “@CAPS16 wrong with ya’ll!” @CAPS17 yelled. “The @CAPS1, fire, @CAPS18 @CAPS19!” I screamed. @CAPS5 stood, we ran, @CAPS5 grabbed a cup of water and poured @CAPS19 on the @CAPS1. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won’t set any thing on fire!” I said."
14, "One day I was looking at a catalog in a store, and saw a goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt. On @DATE1 it came, pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves."
13, "“Are the here yet?” I said as I pased back and forth. “Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker from all the way down here,” said @CAPS1 “@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!” “@CAPS3 got him!” said @PERSON1 “@CAPS4’s right behind us.” “@CAPS5 funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swearI ll @CAPS6 off the camera!” yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 atempted to grab his clothes… and missed. “@CAPS8! My patience has run out @CAPS7!” I said taking another picture “@CAPS10 I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet.” I continued “@CAPS11! You can @CAPS5 put this on the internet!” “so your going to stop picking on us?” I asked “@CAPS8!” @CAPS4 said , “@CAPS13, then I’ll just zoom in right here.” “@CAPS13!” @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave hime his clothes, turned around, and walked away."
11, I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off.
17, "One day my mom, my sister, and I was going to the hair salon to get our hair done. It was so many people there talking. It was kind of noisy too. The tv was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people talking. When we got there my mother signed all three of us in on the sign in sheet then we had to sit and wait. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day but my mom said we had to wait. I got hungry and I was sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn’t let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 player and listened to it until it was time for us to come next. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry but I didn’t say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we were up next. And we all got our hair done. Then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time I was patient at hair salon."

19, "As my dad allways tells me, patient is one of the vary begs to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patients is important. I remember a time when I had to display patients for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to ceadar point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. “@CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out it’s a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get to get on the ride!"

18, "I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it."

Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice ‘@CAPS2 will be here soon, honey dont worry.’ I dont understand @CAPS1 my mother told a @NUM2 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself ‘what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.’ @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ‘I almost lost my patient’ @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasn’t it would’ve ruined my fathers trip.

And I was thinking, “@CAPS1 long does it take for a few people to get shots @CAPS2 that I can leave?” @CAPS2 I had to just sit there for about half- an- hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked it."

I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together. My bones cold, I was only about @NUM1 yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leave and mud, patience wasn't a factor right now. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my poud over my head but the wind and paid blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my door step. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The @CAPS1.

Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Let’s just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Here’s another example let’s just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience."

23, "It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets."" @CAPS4 my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line."" @CAPS5 are there so much people?"" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6 be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding."

19, "Being patient means that when your in a bad situation you don’t complain. Some people aren’t vary patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient we’ll stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I did’nt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldn’t wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience. When we finally got there I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I pasted, and actually it wasn’t nearly as bad as the trip back."

I decied to be patient and see if the buck would come in. I saw I deer move into my blind spot where I couldn’t see it, I thought it might leave like that buck last year in my blind spot too. I waited for @NUM3 minutes, just when I thought he left I saw him again coming right for us. It was at @NUM4 then @NUM5 then @NUM6 and stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to give him the sign to shoot. He under stood drew back his bow and let that arrow fly.

I got out a piece of play doe and I made it into the “@CAPS1” I’ put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of amazement was near its end @CAPS2! I look up to see that my tower was ruined . I look infront of me and see my neiber I told him why did he do that he said because it`s fun. I told him it`s fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it it`s a good thing I was patient. He looked down and said @CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better. He agreed and we both set to work. See how patience is important the problem could have become bigger. The end."

A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. On the very to where zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there @NUM1 minutes waiting. Eventually it came my turn.

She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I could’t wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.
16, "One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thougt that everything he wanted would come to him right a way. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 soon reliesed that not everything came right when he wanted it. So he got really mad when he saw a house for sale, it was a really nice house. But the people living in the house weren’t done moving everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience is key and that when it’s time to move in he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life."

He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient."

22, "One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way” well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something."
23, "It was blistering hot, it had already been an hour in line, “when can we go?” I asked in a moining voice. My parents replied “just be patient were almost at the front.” @CAPS1, that ??? I what I did. My body ??? aching from walking around all day, but that wasen’t going to stop me from all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed and I began to get thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister want to go get a drink with me while my mum held our s??t in line. We made it to the booth. “I’ll take water” I said, ??? realived. I said thankyou, as I grabbed the ice cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2. I couldn’t help but ask, “@CAPS3 can I please get this shirt?” we still have to wait a little bit longer in the if we go back. “@CAPS4 he responded but let’s hurry up @CAPS1 your mom dosen’t get impatient. After I got the shirt we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. All aboard the mummy ride.” The person controlling the ride explained. We walked on, being patient payed off, because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast."

I was me a while then I did it. @NUM6 more it was time to go home my dad and I was tired beyond help. I didn’t complain once and that is the time I was patient.
20, "As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to thee recovery room. I think to myself what if something went wrong or what if he doesn’t make it through the surgery.

9, "Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying “hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody."
22, "@PERSON1 was your average fourteen year old. @CAPS5 had a @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and an annoying eight year old brother named @PERSON2. @CAPS9 parents werenâ€™t that eligble with names. It was ?? beggering of school and @CAPS9 @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 clothes shopping . Problem is @CAPS5 made @LOCATION2 go in. @CAPS5 wouldnâ€™t complain for a month. @CAPS11, oh @CAPS11, did @CAPS5 have to be a ??! Sigh.

I stared, @CAPS5 need is to the girls bathroom and stay there until @CAPS9 were to get @CAPS9.

20, "The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. @CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until @CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3's still like that now."
12, "I was very patient last time I went to the doctors, @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go a head of as and we stayed patient. It got really boring sitting in there but we stayed patient. After about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. So we decide to go up and ask what was going on .We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did we got in."
9, Being patient is about waiting your turn @CAPS1 being cleam you don't complain about waiting like…. being patient throw the day and waiting for school to get out.

18, "Patience, if you are a patient person you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time I was very patient. ""@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!? ""@CAPS2,"" she replied, ""@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back to school shopping. That would mean going with @CAPS1 to a store for @NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencils binders and pens. ""@CAPS4 I really have to go too?"" ""@CAPS5 patient ok?"" ""@CAPS6, I replied. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I began to get more patient. Whenever I had to wait for @CAPS1. I just sat there, I just sat down and waited. And the day seemed to go by a lot faster @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours but @CAPS7 only felt like twenty minutes, when @CAPS3 left. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again!"

And when patient ?? waiting to get something and they do not knew ?? that is patient. And when your patience you ?? come and if you ???
17, Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. One day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn’t know about. After school I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren’t coming until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. My dad had a appogized and went to get me after I explained then I could finally go home.
16, "I’ve been patent plenty of times but when I ordered a new game console that is when I had to be patient. My dad and I were getting a game console that would be at our porch in two weeks. For me it felt like a life time, but I had to keep patient. Not for those fourteen days did I complain, niether did my dad. when it came, it was definitely worth the wait. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain."
21, "Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 point. When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop –the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars."
24, "Being patient can sometimes be very hard, especially, when whatever you are being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and???  meself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside.

23, "To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin’s house to watch her daughter @CAPS1’ @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn’t wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldn’t hush. Tthen I said, “ @NUM1 , what’s the matter ?” @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didn’t complain to @CAPS1’@CAPS4’s mom."
19, "The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a few days after @CAPS18 began to run, @CAPS3, a small, anxious, chestnut room @CAPS1 saw her @CAPS5 plowing a large oval and covering it with @CAPS4 looked like dust.

""hollered @CAPS3 excitedly ""Patience my darling, you're not even a filly! ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11, conclusively. And so @CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks. When @CAPS18 could @CAPS18 ran the track at night. @CAPS18 counted her times and @CAPS18 got faster and stronger. Two years later @CAPS3 was the champion reached for @NUM1 years in a raw. ""@CAPS17 was right! ""@CAPS18 claimed ""Patience is the key!"
17, One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I had to wate about @NUM1 hours to go on the top thrill dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were wating and wating. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I don’t want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever wated for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.
11, Do you know someone who is patient? I do my mom is vary patient with us kids.  When I just blow my top my mom is still cool. All the time my littlel borther makes me so mad that I can’t stand it.

20, "A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having a blast. My family didn’t come because they don’t like roller coasters. We dicided to ride the @CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. After another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours @ORGANIZATION1 it and we even went on it twice."
12, "Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something you need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit about being patient. (@NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need for when we go shoping, or when your in the car. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t then you could get into an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are place then you are going to become annoying. When their are long lines or something and your not patient people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@NUM2) being patient is important. If you have kids your impatient, then your going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing. As you can see I have told you as much as I can about patience."

The smell of it @CAPS2 made me gag! But, @CAPS3 dad loves chop soey  so he makes it @CAPS1 the time! We @CAPS1 sat down to @CAPS7. I ate a potato and @CAPS3 dad gave me whole scoop of chop soey. “I’m not gonna @CAPS7 it.” I said. “I hate chop soey.” @CAPS3 dad sat patiently at the table waiting for me to @CAPS7 what was on @CAPS3 plate. “fine,” I said, “ I’@CAPS4 @CAPS7 the meat out of it.” I took the fork and stired the chop soey around looking for the meat. After I ate @CAPS1 the meat. I said “@CAPS5 I am done.” @CAPS3 dad laughed at @CAPS3 stubbornness. “@CAPS7 the vegetables out of it.” @CAPS3 dad said. “@CAPS9 @CAPS10! I hate celery!” I whinned. After a half  hour of the war of wills @CAPS3 dad won. I @CAPS2 wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop soey and leaving the table. That was when @CAPS3 dad was very patient."

14, One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is. When we got to there we found out that it was @MONEY2 and I said can I buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging he still said @CAPS1! when I went home I went to sleep the next morning I was at home watching @CAPS2.V and I saw this commercially about the game and it said that the game was still @MONEY1 so I ???. When we went to the mall me saw that it was @MONEY3 and so I finally got to buy it.
24, "There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2’d been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. “@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.” @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement “I’m sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.” @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard “@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.” @CAPS6 a big “ughhh” swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5."
19, "‘Patience’  @CAPS1 were on are way the the big city, to go to a very specil baseball game. Can you guess what I game? It’s the “@LOCATION1 tigers,” @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 stadium, “@CAPS1 were so excited, it was the first time @CAPS1 had ever been in @LOCATION1. “@CAPS5 much longer till @CAPS1 get there?” I asked. “About @NUM1 hour, why? my mom replayed  “because its so boring siting here for four hours strait.” “I know, but you have to be patient.” “@CAPS6.” I thought in my bad. “I wounder @CAPS5 I could be patient for? I just though for a moment. Then a minite, then boom! I was out cold: for two hours I slep. Then I woke up just as @CAPS1 hit trafic. I asked “are @CAPS1 there yet”, “hope” my dad said. So I sat there waiting pacently. About @NUM2 min later I asked can @CAPS1 turn an the radio. “@CAPS7” my mom said. @CAPS1 sat there for about @NUM3 in. Then @CAPS1 finaly sarted moving handest not to be anoing, what I was going to do when I got to game. I was thinking mabey I’ll get a bit exspenedve, bur by the time I thought anything else I hurd “were here!” “@CAPS7!” I skeamed. So @CAPS1 got out of the and walked about a @NUM4 of a mile to the ticket booth. As @CAPS1 were walking up I though “I guess all it does take is patience."

14, "The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient."
10, "One time I was patient because, the teacher had to tell me something. So I wated by the door but then she had to go to the office so I had to wate. When the teacher came back she told me thanks for being patient. Patients really means you can wait. Some kids don’t be patient they get so made for example, there was @NUM1 kids in one group we were playing a game and they would get so made because they didn’t get called on a lol. But the game was radom you pick stick and who ever sticks it was went. So being patients mean you have to able to wait."
20, "“@CAPS1 go!”, I yelled while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. “@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friend”, my mom said. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2 I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. “@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8”, I said histaticly. “@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the back”, my mom said. “@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!”, @PERSON2 yelled. As we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute @CAPS4 for us to go. After we got in line I thought to myself, wow this is a long line. It wasn’t that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. “@CAPS11!”, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. “@CAPS12!”, everybody said when we took off.  After that I told myself I can be patient."
17, "@PERSON2 and I went to the slove. @CAPS1 was picking up some marsh mellows and chocolate to make someone. @CAPS1 was walking???

16, Patience you are under standing and tolerance experaners differ allys with out complaining. I will tell you about a time wen I was patient. “I gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall” @CAPS1 you don’t bye me this” @CAPS2 yelled. That is an exsampel of black mail one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six year old girl that I baby sit.one day she was at my house we wer playing a game that involved kiking a showe into a wall. Wen it was my turn I kiked the shou into the wall literally. My mom came home and I told the boys did that of corse she bileved me. But the one thing I had to do with was that thair was a witness. The six year old that cant keep a secret. I told he not to tell my mom because @CAPS1 she did I would get in big troble and she would not be abel to come over any more. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of black mail she said she would tell my mom @CAPS1 I didn’t buy her icecreem. I a @NUM1? F day. I refused to  buy her ice creem so she told my mom my mom didn’t care.
24, "Being patient @CAPS4 a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected. That @CAPS4 why I have alot of respect for @CAPS7 teacher. @PERSON1. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 a very patient person. If you didn’t understand something she will work through it with you until you understand. Even it takes a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn’t understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. “@CAPS1 class today we are going to add negative numberC” @CAPS2 @CAPS4 going to be a breeze I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and @CAPS7 teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When @CAPS7 teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost “ @CAPS3 are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,” said @CAPS7 teacher. A few minutes later she went to every student and checked there answers. When she got to me she had a worried expression on her face. “@CAPS4 everything all  right you didn’t do your sample problems” she asked me. “I dont understand @CAPS2” I replied. @CAPS7 teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said “come see me after class” @CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. “I noticed you were having trouble with math today” said @CAPS7 teacher. “@CAPS6 were gonna fix that.” @CAPS7 teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it I finnaly began to pick it up. @NUM1 minutes later I was doing it. “You can go now” said @CAPS7 teacher. “You now understand it better than the other students.” “thanks for being @CAPS5 patient with me” I said before I left . @CAPS7 teacher just smiled. That was a time when @CAPS7 teacher was very patient with me. And I am glad that she was"
17, "Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for sub`s. (I was playing defense.)  @CAPS1 was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient."
17, "One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since it’s a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go."
17, "You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “@CAPS2, don’t do it again.” @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have."
17, "A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I’m patient when I play volleyball because when you don’t score points, you don’t get to serve. One game we weren’t doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. Everybody got to serve except me on that maten. In the end our team ended up winning  I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Every body cheered and chanted because won by two points."
17, One beautiful morning @CAPS1 went to renew his lisence. But me though if he wake up really early he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there. Unfortunitly everyone thought the same thing. But @CAPS1 was really tired he woke up at @NUM1 am o'clock but they open at @NUM2 am but @CAPS1 didn't know that. So @CAPS1 went to the panacake house and got him a nice hot coffee but when he came back there was a line around the coner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited and @CAPS1 got his lisence.

17, "Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need this to live your life. With out patients your life would be very crazy. One time when I was patient and had to wait for it when it was time it felt good. One day about @NUM1 years ago. I went to @ORGANIZATION1. And if you have been there then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about a hour and a half. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted hause. It looked like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @NUM2 people in line at the time. My mom asked, “@CAPS1 do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the hannah I love?” I told her no and we got in the line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, there was only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and and I. Then it was finally our turn when I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt good to know that after waiting for a long time I did it , I was patient. I did peeping asking if it was our turn, I just stood there patient. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then en that I really could do it, patients. Its an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy"
21, "Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away, that seemed to take so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just @DATE1 I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also know as @CAPS8, (@NUM1-@CAPS9) I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all got solo way afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!"
10, I chose to write a story in my own way about patients. Patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food. In an airplane waiting area you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. Those are the things I know about patience.
17, "I am in the middle of being, well trying to be patient right now. You see @CAPS1 my birthday coming up my cell phone is not working that ??? I told my mom that I needed a new phone. She is  illegible so I have to be patience just hoping and we thing ??? super cool! @CAPS1  the is nv @CAPS2. I don't know which ???  Being patient is really haid. Being patient involves not whining ?? no and mw yelling. Patient can sometimes come with ??? that ??? . so I'll be patient and see how it oges."
19, "It  was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 and the @NUM1  and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at  different  times one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4 and of course there was @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened  to be one of them. The game starts at about @NUM3 o’clock and we started cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we were getting very cold we were wareing our warm-ups but we were still cold. So now that we were cold we were  getting kind of cranky. As half time came it was even colder. We all took a brake and went and got some hot chocolate. Well of corse  we were in a hurry to get back to the  bleachers to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate  down the front of me. Well I was mad but I’m a @CAPS1 leader so I have to be happy. Then we started cheering again and it was colder than when we started but we just kept cheering but then some of the @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to take off there warm-ups and if more pepole want to take them off well all have  to take them off so we did. And we froze  but we held in there until the @NUM7 game was over. Then we all went home and probubly went to bed."
10, "I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you don’t just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait."
16, "There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly for a monthly chek up. When we got to the building my aunt and I relized that there were more cars there than usuall. When we stepped inside we noticed that a flier said “@NUM1 shots @DATE1 threw @DATE2.” @CAPS1 when we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room we seen @NUM2 people. Luckly not all the people were waiting for @PERSON1, but I did have to wait for an hour and fortyfive minituts. @CAPS1 when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me my shot and made shure I was ok. After a long day I went home took a big nap."

15, "One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf you will have to put the leaves in newspaper then put books on the newspaper so the water will come out of the leaves on to the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you half to do this a couple times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was coming up, but mom said to form my project in the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and got @NUM2 extra points. So when your patient you can get rewarded"

21, "A time when I was pacient is when I’m at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill pacients is the key. For example when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to hand stand it was difficult. Day after, day I never could do it. I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes you’ll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me “I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill. I learned being pacient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you."

My mom said you but I had to with a little bill. I was patient by waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to target my mom told  me to ???  up. I ran into  the ???  in the  pay ???  so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad I was patient. Also instead of my mom getting mom she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about. Week ago when I asked my dad do play ??? with  me. He said  you but  you have to wait a whiler. I got very mad for some reason and lost my patience. I started yelling why I have to wait. I then reach  I was having rate and that I lost any patience. I said sorry and then we played  catch."
19, "On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tried & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many night I heard leaves cracking & I thought is it really true. On my first day I would shoot one I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quick & he ran away. On another day we came out I saw another dies but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well that’s what I thought but no it was jamed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walky-talky, & asked “what are you doing.” @CAPS1 I said “I see a doe,” @CAPS1 he said “then shoot it,” & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, “I missed” I said all that patience for nothing."

14, "Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can’t. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new “@NUM1” flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he could’ve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just won’t. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont"

We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me.

He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand and I called him closer. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took the shot and he buckled and the @NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like in life time. Then I got out of my stand he ran about @NUM6 yards and droped. When I got to him. I was so excited because he wasn't won @NUM2 point he was a @NUM8 point back. Do remember use the regin blood head and be patient you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.
24, "Lots of people are good at being patient I’m not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2’s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we don’t mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. I’ve had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldn’t fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, “The up @CAPS7 store” where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2’s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2’s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I’m almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do."
18, "I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home I want to see. “@CAPS1 dad can I go to the movies with someone?” I asked. “@CAPS2!.” @CAPS3 answered. I looked up what movies were in and their was a pretty good selection. I pick the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize I need someone to go with me. I called up my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Ended up she wanted to see it to so, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All over a sudden, it time to leave. I was running behind. I ready really quickly and went and picked up @CAPS4. Unlike me she was calm and patient. In her place I wouldn’t have been. That’s one of the reason why I like @CAPS4 as a friend."
18, "Last @CAPS3 my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was patient for an entire @CAPS3. One @CAPS3, few months and four months and five months to be exsact. Why? Well, the game came out this @CAPS3, on @DATE1 and I had to wait for. How did I pass the time? Simple, don’t think about the game, try not to talk about the game and only write when it comes out on daily calenders. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty two times on every difficulty without any help. (heh,heh!) I still have to wait for another month or so for callop duty:@CAPS4. So this, ah, stinks because now I can’t stop thinking about it."

She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. “@CAPS1 were gonna be late!” yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1’s parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? “@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. “@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!” @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like “???” I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off."

So wen I woke up five people had already gone by. She still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous then another @NUM2 went by its going really really slow. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they was going to put her out. I have never seen her so patient it was no believable."

I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit. But that’s the time I was patient for a little while."

11, "Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you don’t have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didn’t want to wait so she didn’t look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldn’t really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So that’s what happens when you don’t have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so that’s my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences."
17, "One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to @LOCATION1 a place just outside traverse city.

When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2 I show cows so that made @DATE2 zip by really fast. Finally it was @DATE1. I only had @DATE1 wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came fast. Then it was time @DATE1 go. I liked football that year and I have did football ever since.It took patience @DATE1 wait for football. Two months @MONTH1 not seem long, but for a ten year old it is hard @DATE1 wait that long."
19, "The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a preasent when it wasnt even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a hot @DATE1 day and I had been doing my chores witch include racking, mowing, and alot more yard work. Mom and dad and my brother travis had been talking alot. When I was just sitting down stairs they would tell me to to go do my chores then I could see them talking. It bothered me alot that I couldn’t hear what they were saying. I finally just carrien on doing my chores and I just got done mowing witch took two hours and I went inside and I started to watch tv when all the sudden I hear “click click tap bam,” then I heard a sudden yell of my brother travis saying “hey get back here,” I went to our fourteen curly stairs and all the sudden I was greeted by the licking as bbering of a six month old puppy I grabbed his collar laughing and seen his name was max and he is now a three year old happy mutt and that was my brothers preasent to me for getting all. As and doing alot of work around the house. I love my dog but that was the time I had to be patient"
16, "When you hear the word patience what do you think of. I think about a person standing in line at a store when theres @NUM1 people standing in front of you. In @NUM2 grade my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink is water and the winner gets a whole box of dunkin doughnuts to themselves. Day @NUM3 I had about @NUM4 bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there. Day @NUM5 I had about @NUM6 bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned some with my sister. Day @NUM7 all the groaning and the growling my sister was hanging and so ??? in was ??? their  I drink water. Day @NUM8 I snapped and had so much food my whole fontry was gone, my sister @CAPS1 was cheering and she said “don’t worry ill let you have one of my @NUM9 choclate doughnuts” and she kept her word. In my opinion that was patience."
16, Having a melt @CAPS1! I have expereanced this @CAPS2 scene when I was in the @NUM1 grade at cross creeds christm school. It was the @DATE1 and we lived just around the corner. @CAPS3 @NUM2 minutes my patients where a little almost at the fact that my mother wasn’t there get and @CAPS3 @NUM3 minutes later I had a temper  tantrism and cryed and my patients was like a ballot that poped and lowered slowly as I grew angrier and. Angryer at the fast my mom wasn’t there yet. This mast ake will @CAPS4 happen again to me. I made the rong chose to get mad over something redic  usasly  dumb. Learn from my words I as @CAPS4 give up keep trying.
11, "When I had to be patient, was when I wanted a psp. So there was a time when I wanted a psp so bad so I ask my parents, they said I had to wait till @CAPS1. But I really wanted it but I decided to wait for a long time and I finally got a psp."
14, Patient one time I was patient I was realy patient. I was invidet to a sleep over and when I went to the sleep over. So when I get there when went to the stower to get pop in not legible
20, "One time I was patient was in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Guess @NUM1’s @CAPS3!) @CAPS4 was the @DATE1. When we pulled up to the tickit booth the man in the little booth said “tickit please.” @CAPS5 we pulled up to get a parking spot. I hen we got out & ran for the gates. But just then @CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. @CAPS5 I ran back to the truck & got @CAPS4. Then we got into our bathing sutes. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the “@CAPS6 of @CAPS7!” @MONTH1 I mind you @CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, “dose any one want to go with me?” @CAPS8 dad& @CAPS8 moms friend from work said yes! @CAPS5 we got in the line. The line was like @NUM2 to @NUM3 people in the line. @CAPS5 the wait was around @NUM4 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood curtling scream from the ride. Then a man, women & @NUM4 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the @NUM6 foot dropoff then the brite pink & yellow funnle. About @NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. @CAPS5 we went down. @CAPS8 moms friend (@PERSON1) went down backwards. I said “yes,” you go to go down backwards. Halla! @CAPS5 we started going down & then we just dropped (well we freefalled) but we were going like @NUM8 mph. @CAPS4 was scary. Then we got sit out. Then I fell into the pool &got out. I scean @CAPS8 mom & was two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she didn’t feel good. @CAPS5 she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the @TIME1. That is a time I was patient."
24, "Click,’ “ok, cool grandma thanks.”  I say “your welcome.” @CAPS1 says. “When will they be here” I say. “I don’t know.” @CAPS2 you don’t know what @CAPS3 talking about, which you probably don’t, @CAPS3 talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called @CAPS4. And boy was I goin crazy over these things. I waited for @NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time l did, they weren’t there. I was starting to get mad. So finally l rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a @ORGANIZATION1 truck and I thaught on yes hes probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day l look up online were my shoes were, and it said @PERSON1. MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again @CAPS3 wating, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So l went in the car to leave, and I thaught l heard the truck, but nope so we finally arive back at my house and l looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front ?? in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my patients flew away. I felt so happy."
19, "A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My @CAPS1’s stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters, my @CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still, I had to try very hard but eventraully I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride by the way was extremely amazing."
17, "It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong."
22, "During the @DATE1 between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! @CAPS4 of the rides had lines, but none of them had line as long and the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS5 thought @CAPS5 would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but @CAPS5 didn’t see the point. When @CAPS5 got about half way, one of the employees shouted, “@NUM1 more minutes!” and @CAPS5 @CAPS4 became more excited. Eventually, @CAPS5 made to the front of the line! @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had to do was wait for the current trial was over! But then, the speaker came on, “@CAPS4 rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and @CAPS5 must because of safety issues.” @CAPS5 had @CAPS4 considered leaving, but had a feeling @CAPS5 shouldn’t. @CAPS5 talked with some other kids @CAPS5 met in line. @CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @CAPS5 waited under the pavillion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thankyou from my dad  for keeping us in line."
17, "There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will intrest you most. Finaly we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is “paradise” little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave “paradise”. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up.” @CAPS3 we are home”. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patcience."
22, "I had a friend well she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade then in @NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of @CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 moms friend said can you get me a glass of water and @CAPS4 moms five other friends said the some thing. I went and got them water. After that @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took at the trash out the like @NUM4 mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash @CAPS4 best friend was and she said @CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit and I forget all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then said I got to go back inside. I ment in and sat on the sof and @CAPS4 moms friends that were over are house were talking and I sat with than talking laughing, playing, and watching t.v.  After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v. I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forget something, but I didn’t know what so I get up and I walk around the whole telling myself what  did I forget when I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in I seen the phone on the bed and I picked up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even if I had a feeling she didn’t which did. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow your so patient I would never wait that long. She come on you’re @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you so we continued talking."
14, "Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I don’t really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too!"
16, "Last year, @DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3 and out of everything I said “@CAPS1 I want a @CAPS2” (@CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So the @DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1 and we were at best buy. So we walked up to the store and we opened the door and there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect."
12, "Being pactient. Well when I have a baby cousin coming from @LOCATION1 and she was adopted from call for in a so I have never sean her befor I have only seen her in the hillper and photoes. So I have heard her voice on my phone before she sound sound so  cute and I’m missing  my ant and uncle too, I haven’t  seen them in @NUM1 years. Out @CAPS1 still being past waiting for them to come tomorrow or today. It’s a surpize I being pashing."
23, "It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I got into my box blind. It had snowed the @TIME1 but it was only @DATE1. Then again I was in the upper penisaala of @LOCATION1. I was hunting for a monster ten point with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun could kill a dear @NUM2 yards. I have been sitting for an hour but it felt like a day. I’ve only seen a squarile and he was fun to watch in all but not the rush you get when you see a deer. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I was looking in the direction the sound was coming. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” gun up @TIME2 time my adrenilen hicking in. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I see move ment put my scope on it and I see it. It’s a it’s a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and “@CAPS4!” perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted and that’s were he is now."
13, I was patience when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride ???. Then I got on it took off @NUM2 miles pa hour. I was stuck to it for five minutes then it went down ??? @NUM2 miles pa hour. I got off and rode it miles cum force and I was faced to it. The drop is ??? . The ride was @NUM1 minutes long ??? @NUM5 people. I went on the powa hour it was sence. My ??? was the reply it was fun to. I came home as it was in the @TIME1. I woke up and ate breakfast. The whole time is waied patience in everyone.
16, "This a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 @DATE1  we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was  thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there wa a line and I was patient an waited to get on, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said “ready”, I said ready for what another line he said “no” to look at your “room and relax .“ I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient."
16, "Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn’t know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum I’m ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life."
11, one time I was in  patient. We was an are way to see the point. The had family was with us. We all was in @NUM1 car and vans. I was like and the van @NUM2 and the car and @NUM3 in the car.  It was like a @NUM3 hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We was and takere for like a hour.

I’m like no no I want to be there @CAPS1. She like we got all day. Then we stop to get something to eat. Then we was there.
14, "Patient I was patient when I was in @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointment to wait in the waiting room. My some teacher says wait a minit because teachers are talking to someone else. When I have any @CAPS3 teacher says don't open it so I always been patient. When someone tells me to wait. I also be patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, trains to come. I be patient when I'm bored to wait sometimes. That's how I've been patient."
15, One time when I was patient was when I was in the car going up noth to @LOCATION1. I was in the car for eight hours my cusin @PERSON1 was driving and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was in the seat next to her. I was in the backstreet with their dog @CAPS3. My cusin @PERSON1 were talking the whole way there. I tryed asking to stop and go to the bathroom and get food but they are “botton” so I waited and waited an hour friend by so I tryed asking again I got the same answer “botton” so that’s when I asked my patients..
14, "A time when I was patient. Was when I went to the book story and I woned a book. I was at the book store and I wanted a book called tayler swift back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she know I love tayler swift book and her life. As soon as I got it I stared reading it. My mom said thank you for being patient I was you welcome I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store and she said not today and I keep on asking and she said not and I keep on asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car listen to radio and we when to the mall and there was a book store in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok that you wonted I find it and she bote it. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and dont keep asking."
19, A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range. And if one does I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching . The there it is the deer I’m going to shout?? How you draw it back. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer. Me and my dad traked it about soft and there it was. I was so excited that all yelled. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of. Thank you for reading my story. Hope you enjoyed it.

Thank you for being patient. Then after that my mom took me to get something to eat so we were waiting @NUM1 minitus later the gives us are food from the drive through. Sorry thanks for being patient.
17, "Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremly happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt.  @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude  ??? I was patient."
23, "“@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!” I yelled. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. “@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1,” my @CAPS2 told me. “I’m coming”, she said. I’m not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. It’s also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isn’t that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. “@CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,” he told us. “@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?” my @CAPS2 asked me. “@CAPS10 about the @CAPS11?” I asked my @CAPS2 “@CAPS12 not?” she replied. By the way if you didn’t know my name is @PERSON1. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isn’t the biggest ride, but it’s still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. “@CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride,” my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadn’t gone on my favorite ride yet. “@CAPS25’s go on the @CAPS26 force,” I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  I’ve been on the ride, and it’s definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldn’t be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and I’m glad I waited for the best ride."
12, "I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored."
11, "One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb I was patient cause I wasnt complaining about it wasnt crying about. Really wasnt doing enthing cause I didn’t think it was even broken. I wasnt really bothered me. Then I wait to the doctor and got it checked the docter didnt think it was broken cause I almost beat him in a thurb wreste but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays he said it was broken, he was very suprised I was suprised every one was."
16, "I was patient in gym class today for my shill test, I did great in got @NUM1 out of @NUM1. We have @NUM3 biols in my class so it was quiet the wait also when it was my town it took a half of a minute to do it. We wasted all have on the shill will and I was waiting to play dodge-ball all have.It starts because we didn’t get to play dodge-ball. So I pretty much wasted my invite have on the shill test and it starts will tests my story, the end."
14, "I have patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. @CAPS1 example, last year I was on the honor toll @NUM1 times. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do back regards or a @DATE1  patient, then I will do it and I won’t leave it @CAPS1 the last minute. Then, I’ll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I’ll also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesn’t take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she’ll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be @CAPS1 nothing. That really wouldn’t be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble."
15, I remember a time when I was @CAPS1 I was at home it was chritmas time The first one up and I just wanted to open all of my presents and gift but I had to wait till every one got down stairs and @CAPS2 mom to get the camera @CAPS2 we open present my brother and sister whant first be?? The oldest go first a rule my brother made up then finally it was my turn I just randomly took the present and ripped the paper of not even looking at the present because it was my turn I had been @CAPS1 all this time that was the time when I was a @CAPS1.
9, The time I was patient was the time I was @NUM1 years old on @DATE1 it was a snowy night and my mom and dad were buying a new car it took so long I was so hungry mom and dad were talking with the car dealer my brother and sister were playing @CAPS1 when my mom and dad were done talking with the car dealer they looked at the car they wanted and one of the worker's brought me and my brother and sister a box of cookies and milk while my mom and dad were looking at the cookies we got hungry again but I showed patient's. My mom and dad found the car they wanted they chose a van with a @CAPS2 inside they paid for it and we left when we did my father took us to @ORGANIZATION1.
16, "I didn’t know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called buddies. I’ve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet pepsie. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a mountain dew. My brother got cherry pepsie. I don’t know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasn’t so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasn’t even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient."
14, "Elkhorn jr. High school, @DATE1, @PERSON1 colbonthorne was having A pretty bland days, he absolutely hated school, he just wanted to go home, @CAPS1 his teacher told him to sit down shut up , and do his work , so he trys to kill time by flicking erases toys at the chalkboard. after about sixty eraser tops, he looks at the clock and it reads, @TIME1. He complains to his teacher and she says''. @PERSON1 if you don't be patient I'm going to send you home!'' @PERSON1 exclaims,'' @CAPS2 @PERSON1, to detention after school'' so @PERSON1 sits down in fear of detention and does his work, all day, withought complaining ''finally''. The teacher says when the @ORGANIZATION1."
16, "I can’t really tell you about a time when I’ve been patient because that something I struggle with no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but it’s not, maybe. I just don’t try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is I’m at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I won’t save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can’t spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it don’t want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words."
16, "Being Patient. Being patient has it's good & bad. I have had good things happen to me. I @CAPS1 I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happen to me. A time when I was patient was when I tryed out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nuervie l never tryed out for anything befor. I had to wait &wait & wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day when I was at a friend house my mom called me and said ""@CAPS2 you have made the dance team."" I was so happy. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I could saw everyone at my dance compitions. It will be so much fun. Another time I was patient was when broke my arm. I had to be relly patient. I had to be so careful of my arm. I had it in a cast then I waited to get it off. Now I have no cast on. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing & I didn't need a cast any more. If you are patien better things will come."
15, Once I went to @CAPS1 world and we were waiting for about @NUM1 hours to get on this stupid rude. I was they because I had my @ORGANIZATION1 so I played that but on to an hour I got bored. I picked on my sisters and it was on watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that so I just sat down on the road.
13, A time when I was patience was on the car ride @LOCATION1. It was a @DATE1 hour car ride but I stayed patience I diden’t complain. Most kids would say are we there yet but I diden’t. Also when I was supper hungry I sat there and did not complain. Finally @DATE1 we got there. That is a time I was patience.
17, "One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet exspress. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a go thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun."
9, "When my friend was getting his meds I waited until he got ready, I was seating to wait for him. I was getting my phone down loud @PERSON2 ping pong and uplift. I was looking for @PERSON1 and I was waiting for him to be done."
14, "One @DATE1 day, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 point to go on a roller @CAPS2, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was so long, we waited at least @NUM1 hours. Time went by slowly and we finally got on. After, we went to the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half."
10, Being patient is hard to be. First of all its like your waiting in a??? a and line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take long time but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and read at the way up to one from the line or be patient and???.
22, I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!

As he was getting dressed other boys got out there first and took the ball. Later when he got out he saw they had it. So when he got over he was mad and took it from them. After the insadent he came and gave it to them and sayed “I can wait”. So when the were done he got it he was so happy and proud, that he finally got the basketball. When he got home he told @CAPS1 mom and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked,”what is that?” @CAPS1 mom said “it is a thing when you understand and tolerant. The boy was very happy because he always used to take things and now he can wait to use something to be happy. That boy now lives happy with @CAPS1 mom in high school patiently moving along the end."
16, "One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me so she sat with me where ever I went. Mind you there were girls around so I got embarrased and asked mom why are you following me and she replyed cause I don’t want you running everywhere. That when I told her mom I older now, I’m not sorle years old, I’m muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying “your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said “was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story."
21, "@CAPS3 was about a @NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked â€œhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?â€� â€œabout five minutes.â€� @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. â€œhow long?â€� â€œsix now.â€� @CAPS3 wouldnâ€™t have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. â€œThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.â€� @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more. We packed out for the rest of the night."
17, "When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely nerve naking. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaping, wondering, non-stop for @NUM2. I was running around and when I finally sat down I said."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I couldn't be patient anyone. So it walked out the door, when the nerve called your next."" And I was like ,"" well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 and a ½ , "" @CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 and we got here at @TIME1 "" @CAPS5 that wasn't long,"" my mom said.

12, "A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, or friends, or teachers are talking. I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient."
12, "Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is A time of when I was patient. My mom and my step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. BUT!!

16, "In my thirteen years of expirience I have road many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster these is normally a two hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1 I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance @CAPS4 said a forty-five minute wait so we got in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running but @CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that ended @CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @CAPS4 didn't realy affect us. We finaly road that ride and was totaly worth @CAPS4. Most of the lines later that day were small but thats still one hour. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down."
16, A time when I use patient was when I finished my book. We have these thing’s called teacher talk’s where you tell the teacher about your book what you finished.

17, "Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn’t sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted."
22, "My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complian. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good @CAPS2 waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab a orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When when he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good @CAPS2 be patient and waiting to get his lunch.

We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn’t know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient."

24, "Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one."
19, "A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasn’t earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldn’t find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didn’t enjoy."
15, One day I was at basketball practice and I was running has  with my team when I was getting really really thirsty  do after we did are suicides (a running exercise)I asked coach if we could go get  some drinks  coach said “after are double drible down and back exercise” @CAPS1 I did the exercise and we all rushed to the drinking fountain and I was at the end of an @NUM1 girl  line .I waited and waited until finally there I was faced with that drinking fountain when one girl says “ can I have a drink thank you” and all I could do if be stunned..Thats were I heard a bright ladys lets go!” I was @CAPS1 mad but I quickly took a @NUM2 second drink of water and rushed over to coach and now I’m the fisst one alot and I take long drunks do my teammates call me a fish!
23, "There was a girl name @PERSON1. She loved spending time with her mom. Every weekend they would either @CAPS3 the movies, amusement or water park, or just stay home. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about @CAPS1 was about @CAPS3 happen. Today was a @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and her mom was watching videos of her mom when she was young. After the video, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed. Once they settled down, @PERSON1’s mom looked sad. “@CAPS1’s wrong mom?” @PERSON1 asked. “I have @CAPS3 go. I have @CAPS3 go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied. “@CAPS2 not?” asked @PERSON1. “I don’t know, but I need you @CAPS3 wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly. With that @PERSON1’s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there confused and wishing her mom didn’t have @CAPS3 go. Then she went @CAPS3 the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1’s dad came @CAPS3 her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom. @PERSON1 went @CAPS3 her room and began  @CAPS3 wait patiently for her mom. Weeks past and @PERSON1’s mom still hasn’t returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though see never complained @CAPS3 her father and understands that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom. Two years have passed since @PERSON1’s mom had left. @PERSON1 didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried and her mom whispered “I’m sorry.” @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each other’s side again."
19, "One nice sunny day I was traped in a doctors office with no air conditioning. this doctor’s office had @NUM1 chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already cramed in the room with about @NUM2 people for @NUM3 minutes. I was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. Sweat dripped of of my face on to my black @PERSON1 short-@CAPS1 shirt. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience. I know if I was going to get mad even more, it wouldnt help or make the time faster. Then all of a sudden, “creeeeeck,” the door opened. A tall white woman with green schrubs on said, “@CAPS2.”"
14, "One day, my soccer team was in the chamionchip game in we facing the lions. At the start of the game I was on the bench I was the worst on my team. After the @DATE1 we were up @NUM1 but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my. The next to quarters went by and it was tie game @NUM2. Half way through the @DATE2 are star player got hurt so coach put me in. I had no due what do I was just chassing the ball. With one minute left I was standing by their goalie and one of my team mates shot the ball zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal my team started to cheer we were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done and horned went off and every one cheered again and lifted me up. That’s how patience helped me."
17, "One day @CAPS1 went to school pretty earlie in the @TIME1. He went is just ?? if it were a normal day, and goes to his star class in the @NUM1 grade. He chated with his friends all star and then class was over. Then he goes to @NUM2 hour science and there is a lab with partners. @CAPS3 him and @PERSON2 decide to be partners. Half way through the lab they dont know what to do. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 goes up to the teacher and interupts her and another student. @CAPS3 the teacher says ill be with you in a moment, but he continues to bug her. @CAPS3 he got a step.

One that you can get in trouble for being impatient and get a step. Two that if you are pollite and courtaeous in class and be patiet you can get the reward of getting a letter citizenship grade. Wich @PERSON1 did that day."
16, I recall once a famous madican named @PERSON1 was prefering a stunt that took enourmous amounts of pateints and courage it was named “@CAPS1 In Time”. The madichian had to stay in a block of ice for @NUM1 day’s or @NUM2 hours! The great madichian had only a sweater. He had the consiled  ice open to public as the magnificent madichian said “I could bearly hear anything”. He waited hours on and like falling down on abyiss or bottomless pit. Until the final seconds ended. The madichian as finally free. And alive
16, Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didn’t say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didn’t go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children… I don’t like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are “guardian parents” they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.
6, "Patience is when you can take your time at something. When your able to wait, not in a hurry pushing shuvinig  an rushing like some thing bad happen. Being patient also means that you are understanding when it come to tolerents and it when you are calm, cool, peace an love!!!"
19, "Long ago in the land of @LOCATION1 their was a young boy named @CAPS1.@CAPS1 wanted to become a ninja like the rest of the older boys but he was to young, he was only six the years old.One day @CAPS1 came running home,he wasn’t just running he was fliping, twirling @CAPS1 was acting like fire work, @CAPS1 came bursting threw the door, and said “mama mama im @CAPS2 old enough to be a ninga” said @CAPS1, and kins mom said “ well, sorry you can’t ninja training isn’t till another six years”said kins mother, “why now when I @CAPS2 turn twelve.” @CAPS1 replied “well the sensai in still on his training, so you’ll have to be patient” so @CAPS1 waited six long years and @CAPS2 became a ninja"
24, "One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain.’’ @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane’s rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?’’ whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6’s back turned.’’ @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased.’’ @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances."
10, "Patience. Being patient means that you needs to make and dor one' thing constantly to make one????understand. That is patience. My mom is patient. When I dart understand a problem, she will explain @CAPS1 to me, never in rush. She don't yell a t me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what @CAPS1 means. Some people @MONTH1 be impatient because of triats or because that he or she has high blood pressure. Patience is something my people have, but @CAPS1 seems like even move people lacks @CAPS1."
7, "I am patient every year @CAPS1 one specil day to come. My birthday ??? ??? @NUM1 was a specil day @CAPS1 my mom and dad, @NUM2 boy my mom ever had @NUM3 boy my dad had. I am still wating @CAPS1 my brithday to come again."

That's @CAPS3 different place. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got devased. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months.

So, I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty that’s when we got gas and I could eat something or I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right hand or a test area because the have a vending machine there and bathrooms there too. On the right hand side because we can get off on get back on the high way. That’s when I had to be patient."
8, "You have to be paceint when you are cooking some cookie’s. It takes a long time to cook cookies. You have to be pacient when you are waiting to play a game. And you have to be pacint in the watting room until they call you’r name. You have to be pacint when you get out in a game you have to be pacint to get @CAPS1 in. When you get a home run you have to be pacint when they try to get the ball. For exaple the game of the sorry you have to be pacint to get the card @NUM1, @NUM2 if you get a one then you can get out of the house. if you get a to then you get out and get anouther turn."
18, "@NUM1 years ago on my birthday the only thing I wanted was an I-pad touch. Well everybody got to the party we ate cake and ice cream then I opend presants. I got @NUM2 but none was the @CAPS1 toach. I was sad then I opend birthday cards and I got @MONEY1 I told mom since I didnâ€™t get the @CAPS1 I can go buy it. But I had too wait till everybody was gone to go get it. and @NUM3 hours of being patient I finally went and got it."
20, "I was patient when my mom was giving  birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room. My sister and I for @NUM1 hours I slept @NUM2 times and a lot because my dad was hungry so he got @CAPS1 food also.The first hour I was excited and couldn’t wait. The second hour I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to @CAPS1.The third hour I watched tv. The fourth hour I slept till about @TIME1 that’s what my sister said. My dad came out with plastic looking dress on with the matching head/shower cover and slippers, and  he said “ the next time he comes out my sister and  I were gonna be sister to a baby boy .” @CAPS1 and sister were so happy. So an hour later my dad came out and said “ do you want to see @PERSON1 ,” @CAPS1 and my sister screamed “ yes “ When we seen him we were so happy to think he was all ours ."
24, "“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect."
10, "Patience. I was patience when I had to baby sit. I rock him and play with him. I fed him, and walk him. He fell to sleep. My mom still is not home from work. I am going to be late to the movise with my cuzins. I play the game for @CAPS1. I look out the window walk out side and sat on the steps.mom still not there. My cuzins were out side.  Ask that to stay a little on gen. now hear came mom .I can go now."
17, "One day @CAPS1 ??? baseball ??? , when she signed up ??? speech on ??? trophy baseball correctly, spark ??? and other things. Her friend @CAPS2 walked out of the room because he didn’t have patience, so when he came into the room again the sign-up already went around, so after the conference @CAPS2 had to talk to some people and sign-up but he had to sit in a longer ??? from his dad. When it came to playing baseball @CAPS2 quit because he was a ??? he was at the bottom of the batting line up and he only played out feild so when ??? hit a homerun over his head he dropped his miton he field and walked of."
21, "I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn’t work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly."
19, "One night when I got home from cheer I was starving, and the dinner wasn’t even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mack and chees. To past time I went upstairs to take a shower I took ten minutes to take a shower and it still wasn’t ready. So I did some homework. I did math, reading, and I study for a test. The mack and chees was ready the steak was almost ready and the brown rice wasn’t even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tried, but I keeped my patient. Oh my gosh the food smelt so yummy.

Two minutes later the steak was ready mack and chees was ready but we are still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and pourd our drinks I still had my patient. Five minutes later the food was ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoups of rice, I love rice, and a tiny piece of mack and chees. The dinner was awesome. After that dinner I went strait up to bed."
16, "One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were playing halo. We were having a very good time. We ate popcorn, drank alot of pop and ate alot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was there for a wile and suddenly I had  to go the bathroom. Iwaited and waited and had to go very bad. I was very polite and  patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up, I did ask him once if was ok and said yes after that I just waited, then he came out and @CAPS1 a very big realife"
15, At the doctor their were a lot of people se we decided to stay and wait. Also my mom and my dad went with me and my sister to the doctor. Furthermore my sister and I wanted to go outside and play but my parents said no so we watch tv my mom was reading magazine and my dad is reading newspaper. Finally their were a little ??? left so after the person go to the doctor call out my name and my sister so my dad and mom went with us. So my sister don’t get scared they just did check ups after that my dad paid and we left home that how we were being patience.
21, "Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patients for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at disneyland. First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t @NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting i felt like i was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second patients is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So,thats @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patients, but i realized patients is a good thing to have."
15, "One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They so, dit would only take @NUM1 ??? days so, I said “ok that’s not to so days flew by and hats were supposed to come in the mail that day so when us truck came by I was so exited but there was a box for my mom.”@CAPS1.” I said I was really, so planted but I thought to myself they i.e. come tomorrow and??? the didn’t come so I as stil patient but close to not being two more days past so I just gave up then one day when I got home from my friends house they were there yes, finally all my patients payed off and thats the time I had patients."
23, "“@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?” it was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 pritz. The forcast was @CAPS8. @CAPS8 and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The tigers were play the “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.” @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4 and justin @CAPS6 for the tigers. My dad + my mom and my brother and I were just two rows from the front row. It was the bottom of the first and I feel a huge drop of @CAPS8 touch my head. Then I feel another than another. “@CAPS7 upstairs for shelter!” my dad yelled. As soon as we got up in the selter area complete down poor. That’s all I have to say. The players went into the dugduts. My mom called my grand pa to see what the forecast is. “@CAPS8.” @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said “its gonna be a long @TIME1 so rest up now” at first I didn’t understand. But after she explained to me I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2 so waiting is not really my thing. An hour past by it was still raining. @NUM3 hours, than, @NUM4, than finally 41/@NUM3 hours past by. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1! The game still wasn’t starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for ever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @NUM7 ½ hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patiente. The game ended at @NUM9! we only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the drive. In the end I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get ice cream.) I learned patience pays off!"
9, "One time I was patient is when I was going skating. And I was waiting for my mother to come pick me up from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I told my friends ""yu ll need a ride"" and I made a mistake and told my mother  the wrong time period it  was @NUM1 and I told my mom @NUM2 and had to wait a whole @NUM3 hour."
20, "A time when I someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1 was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduting from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2’s @ORGANIZATION1, while taking care of a seven month old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. Also, @CAPS1 was trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2 , @LOCATION1 with a lot of other staff to do. After, two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a new eight month baby boy, studying for a test, helping her parents, came here, and graduting. @CAPS1 was able to help plan a beautifullwedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was patient"
12, "In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you don’t be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didn’t get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life."
16, "One time I was patient was when I was going to @LOCATION1 because the car ride was @NUM1 hours long. I was hungery, bored, and really needed to use the bathroom. I didn’t tell nobody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to @LOCATION3, I was happy we stop and eat in @LOCATION3, I know that from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 is not a long way but hey I eat at @NUM2 and is like noon. We finally eat like having and hour in @LOCATION3. I did really good being paitent, because when I am unpaitent I get really mood and people don’t want to be with me when I’m mood."
9, "Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn’t just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience."
14, "Over the @DATE2, on the @DATE1 to be exact me and my family want to see fireworks at a local park. It was a time for me and my brother to visit all my friends, we were so excited ?? ?? me than an hour to get there. I was so patient because I knew if l wasn't my mom would not be in a happy mood. ""Are wether yet?"" my brother mouned. ""@CAPS1 my @CAPS2, @PERSON1 we just got in the car."" I said my brother has always been important, I of course didn't say a word on the way there and everything he said something the ride felt longer."
17, "Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid of. It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. Thats why you should always be patient, and wait. By; @PERSON1."
15, The time when i was patient was when christmas came aroud. At first i just wanted christmas to get here. But my mom told me I had to just wait and  that it will come soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a wii consle and the sims @NUM1. So finally when christmass came i got what i wonna and some. Usually @CAPS1 not that patient but the reason I was is becaused my mom told me that it will come soon. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something the more patient you are the faster it will come.
16, "This is a story when I was patient. I believed in aIeons. So I went in a field and sat and waited for them. I was about @NUM1 years old. So I thot to go out there, I am out there waiting and waiting. Then I saw something, my gosh its just a shotting star. I was so existed but is wasen’t one. All of a sudden I saw a deer and it was running rite after me. So I shot it. Then I was waiting I was waiting. I was bored so I made up a song. I am waiting for the aIeons yes I am waiting yes I am. When it got dark out I saw something. It was the aIcons. the space craft stop in the field. The aIeons walk out and shot all of them. Then took them home and showed them to the hole town. They didnt believe me the I told them to go to the field and look at the space craft and they all fainted. Thats a  time I was patient."
24, "“@CAPS1 kids. Today @CAPS10 are going to look into our microscopes. I will pick your partners.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked @CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart. @CAPS10 were assigned to microscope” The teacher told us @CAPS10 had to draw everything @CAPS10 see in our notebooks. @CAPS2 looked into the microscope, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere. “@CAPS3, can I see?” I asked. “@CAPS4 I have to draw it in my notebook.” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “@CAPS1, @CAPS17 hurry up.” I @CAPS5, not noticing I was being impatient. “@CAPS8, who can accept @PERSON3 in their group? He needs  a partner.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand. “@CAPS10 can!” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “@CAPS12! Really @CAPS2?” I complained. “@PERSON2, don’t be rude. You know he is new to our @CAPS8.” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON3 walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. “@CAPS2, can you go any slower?” I shouted. “@CAPS17, can you yell any louder?” she shouted back. Finally it was @PERSON3’s turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing. I tried to peek at @CAPS2’s paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. “@PERSON2, you really need to @CAPS4 your turn and be patient. @CAPS10 will all get a chance to look through it.” @CAPS2 @CAPS5 to me. “You’re right. Thanks @CAPS2. I’m sorry I was acting like that.” I @CAPS5. “it’s alright, I act like that too, @CAPS3, maybe @CAPS10 should all sit together at lunch.” @CAPS5 @CAPS2. “That would be cool.” @CAPS5 @PERSON3."
13, When I was going to the doctor I had to be patient I went there because my auntie driveway had a crack. And I was riding my scooter. I must wasn’t paying no attention because my scooter. Had hit the crack so I sprang my knee. So my dad camed out the house to pick me up. I had to get in a wheel chair. And wait because there wasn’t no more curtains left. I waited for a hour then I got my turn. And they checked my knee. Then they gave me chounces to walk with. It was pretty hard to go up my house stairs.
16, "I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1. I was patient because I didn’t want to get really excited about @CAPS2 .When I get excited about things we have a change in plans, and we would have to ‘cancel. So I stayed call” and we was in the car in a little over an hear then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and got @CAPS2 and I was patience about @CAPS2, ??? we was quiet the whole way there I had is the story when I was very patient about going to @LOCATION1."
21, "I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months –old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it."
12, A time when I was patient was when I went to sedar point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and it was a long ride. When we got there it was a long line to get in. My mom said “all right guies time to be patient”. Once we got in we went to the first rid we seen. It also had a long line. Mom said “we are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides”.
7, "I am always patient with my family, my mom and @CAPS1 do a lot of me and fan always patient if they take some where. Sometimes, for hockey my mom and @CAPS1 take me. Hockey. My @CAPS1 usally takes but on @DATE1 my mom takes me and I patient. For homework, I am always patient, if I go to @PERSON1’s golfland my mom, saids she will take and I’m always patient."
19, "Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  “@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school again”. I hollered at my @CAPS4 “@CAPS1”, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn’t take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know, I sighed but I still don’t want to be late” “I know but remember, being patient will get you far.” “@CAPS6” I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didn’t whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn’t cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didn’t grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldn’t be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on."
18, "One time I was patient when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 would not work every body sat down and was quet. It took up the hole hour there was a little, chitt chatt her and there but mostly every body was quiet for her while a capo of sudents helped her. We going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tryed to play the movie, it wouldn’t come on you could hear it but couldn’t see it, the at the end of the hour you could see it but you couldn’t hear it, “but it worked for all the other the classes” @PERSON1 said the next day she gave us fruits snacks for being so patient and she got the movie to work first it was in just gray and white the she jiggled a card then it showed color but the day that I was patient was the @NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher she was proud of me and I was proud of myself I can’t believe what I did for @PERSON1 then it happend again this time she let every body just chill in our chair and talk with our friend but I just watten her fix her @CAPS1 but the next day she didn’t give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends’. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient."
18, "You being patient is important. People should always be patient &not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time & wait. People need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, shayna was not being patient because she wanted on get on the dance box. But, she could`nt because a lil girl named @ORGANIZATION2, was on the dance box & shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when you we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad & started to cry & roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS1 she now up to me & said, “she want let me get on,” @CAPS1 I said, “@PERSON1`@CAPS2 , you have to be patient & wait your turn because she was on it first & that would be rude and unfair to make her get off.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized & they both took turns on the dance box. But last, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy & she learned her lesson."
17, "One day we went @CAPS8 the mall me. Sharae. Reynal. Me and @PERSON1 wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 pac sun so we were patient and let her @CAPS9 @CAPS8 that store. Then me & reynal wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 but sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS4 so we were patient & let her @CAPS9. Then me & reynal wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 but sharae wanted @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 until @CAPS5 we said…..ENOUGH @CAPS6. WE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11!!! She said ok, ok, ok but can I just, no. Please, no, please. NO! Alright @CAPS12 we’ll @CAPS9 @CAPS8 @CAPS11, I was just gonna ask @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 the bathroom."
22, "A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1 the largest indoor water park I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM1’’our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @NUM2 that means I have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, thats not fair I thought to my self but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait it out. ‘’I have to go to the bathroom’’ I said in a moaning vice. ‘’well cant you hold it?’’ my mother asked I’m about to explode and your asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myelf. ‘’ok pull over here, but it’s gonna add to to our @CAPS2 time.’’  ‘’I @CAPS4’t core!’’ I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say ‘’@CAPS2 time @NUM3.’’ @CAPS6 man that means no more bathroom breaks I m gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. A hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3  say ‘’arive on destinaton on left’’  ‘’@CAPS8!’’ I schreeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1 but then I saw a sign that ‘’water park closed!’’ when suddenly I felt my dads hand hit my shoulder and he said ‘’sorry sport maybe it will be open tommorow.’’ @CAPS9 out it was’nt open the next day it was still closed because they were working on to many rides that it was dangerous to go into the park, so I had to be patient for that whole day, but I could’nt we were leaving tommrow! Yhe next day it was closed again til five but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So at @TIME1 the park was still closed and we were checked out ‘’I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. ll go send one more night’’ my dad said. ‘’@CAPS8.’’ I get to go in the park! And that was the time I was patient."
6, Patience what can I say it don’t have none of personally like things to go quickly I also don’t like it when people do things slow.
15, "I remember a time when I was patient. I use to be able to wait for anything.one time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to cedar point. You have to be burn with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they can’t wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient. You have to be born with patient. Its not something you learn over the years. I could want three week without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesn’t work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older. Who knows maybe somebody might be more patient than me I the world."
17, "“@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!” @PERSON2 said, “I wanna go first!” @CAPS2 the time in cheerleading this girl named @PERSON2 thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah my name is @PERSON3. I’m always a fiuter along with @PERSON2. I’m always patient and wait my turn because I dont wanna complain or be a poor spot. “@CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6” the two bases and backspots yell. They pop @CAPS4 out and up thenscream “@CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job.” @CAPS7 says. “@CAPS8, it’s my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this your better then her.” I thought to myself “@CAPS9 we can do this. “One of are bases @PERSON1 said. I get @CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @CAPS3 to get poped up into the air. Are other base @CAPS10 says “@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3,@NUM4,@NUM5,@NUM6- @CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!” @CAPS13 cheers but loss. “I was so excited, “I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5.” I thought with excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 after @CAPS2. From that day on I’ve always be patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on."
18, "Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes @CAPS1 not @CAPS2 going to tell you a story when I was patient when @CAPS1 normally not patient in situations like this. I had want to school with my mom so she can take a test @CAPS4 drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting I was texting and on the internet, @CAPS4 my stomach started to rumble, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I can get something to eat as I was texting I stopped and thought about what was I about to do. I knew @CAPS5 hard long she had studied for that test. I didn`t want her to get a bad grade so I just sat there. I texted people. People called me so my mind was off food. After my mom finished her test she came out the room. I asked her “@CAPS5 did it go?” she looked at me smiled and said “I felt confident, but know @CAPS1 hungry I shouted out “me to” we got in the car and went to subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cooking, chips, and a drink it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @CAPS4 we went @ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and others places as well. After I thought about it I never want to do that again. I was starting and my but started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing to do never again will I do that. At least I had bounding rime with my mom. That’s one bright side."
19, Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.
12, "Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good desisons fo me, patience is the ability to stay calm, patience is very important because it alows me to ratinoly deel with suituations so that I @MONTH1 not get into trouble: @CAPS1 patience in times of stress is dificult. It is dificult beacause people are giving you greit. without @CAPS1 patience people make bad dessisons, this leads to bad things hapening. Paitence lets me deal with bad ideas like the @CAPS2’@CAPS3. by using paitence, I can deal with the problem and then move on @CAPS2’@CAPS3 are a very bad idea"
15, "It was the night before @CAPS1 eve and I couldn’t hardly wait. In @CAPS5 family on @CAPS1 eve we go to @CAPS5 grandparents house. When we are there we talk, eat, and @CAPS5 favorite open presents. As @CAPS5 mom, dad, and I drove up to @CAPS5 grandparents house I couldn’t open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the door bell a hundred times. “@CAPS3 hello there, @CAPS4” @CAPS5 grandpa said. “@CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open @CAPS5 presents?” “yah, sure.” @CAPS7 we were done eating I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn’t wait. As I waited patiently until all of @CAPS5 old relatives opened their presents it was finally @CAPS5 turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw what it was a game. Since it was the first present I had to open it fast but from then on I waited paitently until it was @CAPS5 turn."
17, "My mom has very little patience, that’s way it surprised me when she had a whole bunch the day my grandma passed away. I was amazed she was sad but took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect. It was a terrible day and all any of us wanted to do was cry. My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy, that’s why she watched her every move. As soon as I got there she came right up to me and gave me a huge hug and no matter what my little brother and I did she didn’t even mind. That was a very surprising day because I had never in my life seen her that sad but yet so patient."
13, I forget to grab my helmet and ??? pads out of my mom’s car cause she works until @NUM1 and at @NUM2 that ??? ??? ???. Then my patience showed up.
21, "“@CAPS1 back harder on the reighns!” my teacher yelled “@CAPS2 trying, but hes @CAPS8 not listening!” @CAPS3 had to be the most stubborn horse I had @CAPS13 ridden in my life! @CAPS6 did whatever @CAPS6 wanted, whenever @CAPS6 wanted, and payed no attention to me at all. “@CAPS4, @CAPS4 @CAPS8 bring him in.” @CAPS6 said I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. “@PERSON1, I really am trying, hes @CAPS8 not listening.” I said “I know @CAPS6 can be a bit hard-headed but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him.” @CAPS3 horses name was @PERSON3, @CAPS6 was a reddish-brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. @CAPS6 looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! “@CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.” @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS4 fine.” I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. “@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!” @PERSON1 yelled “I think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows.” I said “@CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick!” @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! “@CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2.” I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again."
16, Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. I’ve been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til’ closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.
6, Well you need patience when your fishing and whe your food is comeing or going to be served to you but also be patient with everybody else.
19, Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesn’t want to be at home because he mom don’t let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.
17, "“@CAPS1 @CAPS2” said my little sister @PERSON1 “@CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball we are doing it in gym and I @CAPS6’t know how.” “Of corse” I said “lets go to the back yard” @CAPS4 my way out I grab a ball. I set it down @CAPS4 the ground in the front of me and say “@CAPS5 you do is step forward with you left foot and kick with the top of you right. “ I’ll try @CAPS8 say” daughtfully. @CAPS8 runs up to the ball an kicks, he misses but thats @CAPS7. @CAPS8 trys againe another miss. @CAPS8 sits down @CAPS4 the ground. I go up to her. “@CAPS6’t give its only your second try, not everyone is good at soccer try one more time. “@CAPS7, one more try.” @CAPS8 runs up to ball and kicks. The ball goes sailing into the goal. “@CAPS9 you for teaching me @CAPS2.” “I was my pleasure just try to be patient with yourself and you’ll be a great soccer player I promes.” “@CAPS7 but I want to practice some more.” “@CAPS7.”"
17, "We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until we’ve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food."
14, "When I was about nine years old. I took my homework home with me. I showed one of my older brothers, my homework. He look at it then he started helping me with it. Then he did a couple of answers. To show me what I had to do because I didn’t really know how to do my homework. So he had to do his homework so he told me to do my home work. So I started to do my homework I did all of my questions correct. But it was a realy hard question on it. T wanted to ask my older brother. But instead I didn’t do that because he was doing his work. So I did it myself."
17, "@CAPS2 story is about the time @CAPS2 mom ran out of gas. @CAPS2 mom was driving down @LOCATION1 @NUM1 driving home. Soon we started running out of gas. The bad thing is, it was raining. Then we ran out of gas. First she had to get someone to pullover and ask if they had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She asked if they could get gas. Every one said â€œ@CAPS1!â€� @CAPS2 mom then decided to call @CAPS2 dad and ask him to get gas. He then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas. That was just enough to get @LOCATION1 home. If @CAPS2 mom had @CAPS1 patience she whould of gone crazy."
17, "One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours then he said acler our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite."
17, My name is @CAPS1 and I’m writing about a time I had be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2 it was the eighteenth and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vaction we were going to  @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the house hold packing every thing into a hammer that we rented for the trip so every one would fite into the car. We had packed all things into the car. My made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sasauge pancakes and bacon and scaldded eggs. It was delicouse. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway I had fell a sleep a hour into the drive. By now it was ten acloak at night and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into a urgement my told all of use to be quited and we did but we were all get on each other nerves. And I had to be patient for another two day but we got there and I was glad to be there so overall it was a funture till we had to go back.
15, "I don’t have much patience, but I’ll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasn’t. My mom said “@CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out him”. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads “@CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4”. But when I was signing the note he pulled up. That was the story when I had patients."
9, "When I was around the age @NUM1. I went to @CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, and mom, and dad for a family reunen, we stoped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at @TIME1 and we got to the motel at @TIME2 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, @NUM2 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my @CAPS2 until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the coner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I don’t know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was."
16, "There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after @NUM1 years and @NUM2 ½ weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn’t take it she asked him on @DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then @DATE2, after getting to know me better he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but were still besties!"
21, "One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasn’t coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a bird’s eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience."
16, I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.
16, "One time when I was patient was when the shot flew was going around. I had to go to this one place to get the flew shots. When we got there we got in line, I had to be patient because the line was really long is??? the line to get through. We brought chairs, hot coce and staff to do to keep us any feet. I had to be patient in tell I got on to the front of the line. The worse part was that most of the tide was outside and it was @CAPS1 eve, so I had to be patient in the cold, when we finally got inside the building I was so happy. Then about @DATE1 we got to the front of the line. I’m glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flew shot again."

21, "@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his ownersâ€™ sister hamster @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in and a slide and running wheel. @PERSON1 wished he had one, @CAPS1 his owner didnâ€™t have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 play in his, he still wanted one. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking ta @PERSON1, I really wish I had one of those hamster toysâ€� said @PERSON1.â€� @CAPS1 my owner doesnâ€™t have enough money!â€� â€œ@CAPS2â€™t worry â€œsaid @PERSON1.â€� You can play in mine until he does. I hear heâ€™s almost got enough.â€� â€œ@CAPS3, I guess, thatâ€™s close enough. â€œA few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand new toy, never than @CAPS4, â€œI guess @CAPS5 was worth waiting!â€� @CAPS5 was twice as big than @PERSON1â€™s, so they could shore. And they both lived happily ever after."
16, One day at my school. It was lunch and I was very hungry. The lunch was filled with kids. I could hear my stomach growl I was so hungary. I stood for ten –minutes then I started thinking maybe I could cut. But no I didn’t. It felt like an hour had gone by. I was still waiting s trying to be as patient as possible. Then I relized the line was moving quicker and quicker. Until I finally got my food and ate. I had only five minutes of recess but I was just happy to eat. Patient is by
10, "This is a story about patience, one day my friende tells me hey did you ever be patient. I told him no I have never in my life been pacients, well you should he told me. One day my frend is telling my new game is coming out and I just talk why he was talking  I can tell that he did not like it at all, so in class I  am telling every one that I won him in race. But I had no patients on me so I stoted complaining to him I said  I won   and he said  you have no patienc and it  kepted going on and on. Then my other friend said stop it right now! I am sick and tired of this you have no patients and you lost @NUM1 game! Ok some time we all have complained in are life! Just stop fighting please. So the next day I said do you have eny thing to tell me I will listen better now. I learnd that I should listen to what people have to say then talk that will  get  are friend ship to the next leveal."
17, A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @CAPS1 the party came I got all my presents’ exept the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left till ten. So I fell asleep. When I wook up no one was up. So I still had to wait. (I hate waiting.) @CAPS1 my mum got up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 my dad finally got up (@NUM1) I finally got to open my presents. It was worth the wait.
15, "@DATE1 one, day I was at the store with my sister and my mom thair were people coting, runing in each other and yelling â€œget out of my wayâ€�. That made me mad and every one else but like every one else I was not yelling at the overwellmed people. It was almost christmas I seen why every one was geting so mad. We were all trying to just mind are own bussnie. But for some reson people dust made everyone else mad so thatâ€™s when patience came in. After all we got out and when home. Thatâ€™s why you should have patience."
11, "Patience can really help you in life some times it’s the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I’m waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you'll get in a sitchation were your waiting for someone but there is always only one choice, to wait or be patient."
8, I like bilding a house or a puzzle. Becouse it takes time to do puzzels it takes dedication hard work and patients to complet a house. If you have no patients then it is harder to complet when you just get board of it.
12, "Some people a completely patient. Some people aren’t patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If it’s @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When we’re going somewhere special, or I’m trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! It’s like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can’t always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when I’m cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I’m super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn’t come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you don’t have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers aren’t always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!"
24, "The four sisters waited in line the second most exciting ride of their days at cedar point. Right behind @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by @CAPS14 it started to get quit again. “I am soon super, doper excited!”  @CAPS4 the youngest sister ???. “ I know me to.” The rest said at almost the same time. Eight hard eyes moved at the same time watching the same thing. The @CAPS5! There were twists, torirs, diues, and hills involved with  this serious packages deal. “@CAPS6”. @CAPS10 long has it been?!” ??? @PERSON3. “@CAPS7 hour.” @CAPS8 the oldest, ???, putting her long, dark, curiy hair into a pony tail. “@CAPS9 young grasshopper” said @PERSON4 has the petteel the side of??? face, “@CAPS10 this son has really got to me “@CAPS11!” agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. “@CAPS12 my ??? guys look! Were almost to the front!” exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2. “@CAPS13 me!” said a voice coming from??? abuse. “@CAPS14 you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we ran. Thank you.”  “ I really hope @CAPS15 finish it soon!” said @PERSON3. ‘@CAPS15 all agreed. @CAPS15 waited for about a half @CAPS7 hour @CAPS14 another anouncement came on. “@CAPS16 again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be fixed for another @NUM1 hours. Thank you for choosing cedar point.” And the voice shut off and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, go ride the grant swings."
24, "“it’s where?”  The woman asked for the third time. “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didn’t say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often don’t meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  “@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.”  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of young’s incorporated.  “@CAPS3, you’re with young’s?”  @CAPS4 asked. “  Do you know where the show room is?”  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  “@CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.”  I said in a robotic voice.  “@CAPS6’t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?”  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  “@CAPS8, sir.”  “@CAPS9 old are you?”  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  “@CAPS11, sir.” I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high –schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4’d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. “Are you getting paid?”  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  “yes,  sir.  But it’s @CAPS12 a lot.  It’s more like volunteer work,  really.”  @CAPS13 don’t ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  “thanks son.” “You’re welcome.”  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think we’ll both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dad’s shop, because if @CAPS4 didn’t, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient."
12, "Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesn’t lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience"
24, "It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @DATE1. It was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert. “honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned.”it’s a suprice”she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied.” When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don’t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9’ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later……… “mom its taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, I couldn’t believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself."
14, "There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it."
16, "A time I was patient was when I went to get my teath cleaned than ??? that i went  to doctors. I waited  three (@NUM1 )hours  to get my teath cleaned and that was hand so I took a book out to read than when I was on reading the book about @NUM2 ½ times I got called to get my teath cleaned, after that  I went to the doctors to get wald, medisan refilled and get some shoes. I had to wait for about two (@NUM3) hours before getting called into the room, but than I waited @NUM4 so they could get the shots ready. So I waited about five hours and five minutes, after all that time I finally went to eat some lunch at @ORGANIZATION1. That was all I did that day."
19, "Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time but when your impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was @CAPS1 impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in @NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @NUM2. Then waited another day @NUM3. He wasted @NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade drope to a @CAPS2+ and now he’s blaming @CAPS3! So I told him hard @NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @CAPS4- he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is @NUM6, he’s a lot happier now that hes patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied."
21, "This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I frozzes to listen, the tickets were going on sell down town. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got dozen there so fast you wouldn’t even see us leave. When I got to the line it was so long it seem like it go on forever. I waited and waited it felt like it only moved on an inch. Ti waited and still waited I beagin to get mad but I stood in line. Which my long wait was over I begain to jump for joy. As I walked to the concer she said “sorry we are all sold out. I couldn’t believe it I begain to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing it was so unfair. And that’s the time I was patient for noting."
13, "Yester day I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. @CAPS1 took a little while but @CAPS1 was my turn next. When I got home I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though @CAPS1 was only an hour until @CAPS1 would be ready @CAPS1 seemed like @CAPS1 was a life time. The delicoas aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat pationtly and read my book until @CAPS1 was done. After words I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with thier toys. So I had to pause the show because they cant do anything when the @CAPS2 is on. So patiently, I waited for a excruciaing @NUM1 minutes until they were done. So over all I think I was very patient yesterday."
19, "This @DATE1 me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, all went to A @ORGANIZATION1’ concert, @CAPS1 mom wasnt very excited, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was only excited just to see ‘@PERSON1’, I was very excited just to be going  @CAPS4 we entered the parking lot to the ‘@ORGANIZATION2 music  @CAPS5’ @CAPS6 was a huge line at the door, it took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats. It started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done I was soaked. Then people started setting up  the stage for The ‘@ORGANIZATION1’. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 mom were both getting irritated I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side it was an amazing concert and @CAPS7 glad I got to have the experience but next time @CAPS7  whering a hat!"
14, A time when I was patient was when I was at my dad’s office. We were there for an hour. And be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient. I had to take an entire hour not saying anying. Until my dad told me too.
17, "One important skill you need in the life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient payed off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even more. Then I played sports after a had my coat cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough."
7, Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is ??? your ressence aterring his sweet time. You don’t want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would make you not get the job. So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life.
24, "There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different??? of these languages, in all that is  more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language patient means the same thing, understanding and tolerant. Everyone had to be patient at one point or another, let me tell you??? one time were I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both. I sent her e-mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times @CAPS1 didn’t answer or reply. I got even more frustraited the more @CAPS1 ignored me, then I talked to my cousin about it. “You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight.”@CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. so, I waited by the phone to see if @CAPS1 meassaged me back without using  swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day @CAPS1 talked to me. @CAPS1 said “I’m sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. I’ve missed hanging out with you, how about we sit together at band?” “I’d life that.” replayed and finally made up after five days of fighting. After experience I learned that being patient   pay off. So wait your turn @NUM3 speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the hey."
14, The time I was patient is when I was to clean up my house and my mom said I would like me to ??? when she get’s back. So I straighting up vaccuming spreading my bed cleaning bathroom taking the dogs outside clean thier raven did the dishes took out the trash did the laundry and once I done with a lot I would watch @CAPS1 play the game or on the computer I waited about the whole day and once she got her she didn’t when bring would she said I forgot so we were to get pizza.
12, A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctors office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But he was taking a really long time to come out and I was ??? to be patient so hard to stay caled andy then the doctor came out and I started to feel  better.

18, "Jenny and @PERSON3 were twins brother and sister every year a carnival was built up next to their house with games, rides and food. One day @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 went to ask their mother @PERSON2 politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel mom, “can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris  wheel.” @CAPS1 @PERSON1,”sure “ @CAPS1 mom and handed them two dollars. @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 were so excited they ran to the line of the ferris wheel. They waited and waited for an hour and it was finally their turn, during this time for man that was in charge of the ferris wheel had watched @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 wait in line. As @PERSON1 were about to step in the cast to mean boys pushed them off to the ground and took their seat. Now mama taught them how to be nice to everyone and they remembered that so they got back up and let them go. When it was their turn again the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what just happened and told them that he was proud of @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patients.

23, "@CAPS12's the @CAPS1 of the ninth winning @CAPS2 @CAPS3 up to @CAPS4 full count, @CAPS5 loaded, two out. As the pitcher hurles a @NUM1 fast ball right down the center, @CAPS2 swong and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exsploded, and @CAPS7 as we were about to leave The anoncer said "dont forget kits to day and today only down on the field the @CAPS8 are singing atographs". I beged and pleaded my dad to let the stay, @CAPS9 @CAPS14 agreed. @CAPS10 the time I got down there these was a huge line. As time slowly ticked @CAPS10 minutes seaming like hours. I could see kids geting ancie. I would have to @CAPS11 my dad had not said "The only way we ran stay is @CAPS11 you are pertiant ". @CAPS12 took forever, all you had to do was look around and you would see kids going nuts The little ones were crying. I could tell I was maby one of the last five people Being patient, even my dad was getting frustcated  @CAPS12 took at least two and a @CAPS13 hours to get to the front but @CAPS12 felt like @NUM2 days. I @CAPS14 got the whole trams autograph and I was so happy. I even supriezd myself that day I had no idea that I had @CAPS12 in me to be that patient for two and @CAPS13 hours. On our way home my dad stoped at @CAPS15 and got me a frosty, @CAPS9 said @CAPS12 was for being patient was not so bad @MONTH1 t'll be more patient from now and @CAPS16."
17, "There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for every else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2"
22, "“@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!” I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the “maverick” at @CAPS2 point. “That’s what the sign say’s, but it could take longer,” my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone “I gusse we can wait,” but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didn’t work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn’t want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didn’t complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient"
12, I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I did’t eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other don’t. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients.
18, "The time I was unpatient. On the day of @DATE1, I rose out of bed brushed my teeth got dreest and ate break feast then me, my mom, and my brother drove to the doctors. Whitch is an hour from our house. I was not happy because  I was tired and just thinking about how long @CAPS1 going to be sitting their just waiting for the doctor to say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 but no I got to sit their sit their staring at the walls. Soo know were here and @CAPS1 just soo happy to sit and waite because my mom did tell me thousands of times “you need to stop being so unpatient,” well I cainte help it. Any way my mom just signed in for me so I guess I’ll just look at magizeens boring boring boring. They don’t even have people magizeeing “come on” I said my mom said “you need to waite @CAPS1 sure they will call your name any secound,” well not any secound because its been about @NUM1 boring min. ooh lookie here time for lunch but no we have to still just sit here and waite. Gosh I’m so hungry. Well finlly the doctor just called my name and it’s time to wait again! In conclusion theirs a time I was unpatient I was un patient waiting at the doctors just sitting their thats why if it has something to do with waiting “I’m not interested.”"
14, "I am patient wherever I go to the dentist’s office, orthodontist, or doctor’s office. The first time is at the dentist’s office when I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and end magazines .The next place I am patient is outhodontist,I sit and wait in the first room and crater to my I-pod after a few minutes the call me into the second room where I wait little longer to get my bracer frightened . Once I get in the office I have to wait for the guy to tighter them. Finally there is the doctor’s office where you sit in the big waiting foom for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in when you get there if you are getting shuts you have to wait patienty for the doctor to being them. As can see a lot of things take patience."
15, "Patience. Patience is something I have absolutly nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the @CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @NUM1 hour drive turn into a @NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story."
9, "Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people can’t wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldn’t be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way."
19, "In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn’t get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn’t going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1’s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1’s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. “@CAPS1” my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight."
24, "Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist’s office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl’s tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didn’t it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didn’t mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory."
7, One time my friend was began patients waithing for the teacher wall he was talking to a teacher. Afocer that he was duen talking with a teacher. Then she will get her question that she need. That is a time when my friend that was patients.
11, "Patients is about many things. First, there is diffrent ways to express patients. Second, people either have patients or they don’t. I admit I am one of those people that don’t have patients. My mom is always saying, “@CAPS1 your horses.” @CAPS2 I know. I don’t have patients so why does she have to tell me I don’t? I don’t have any patients in grocery shopping I can’t wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just can’t help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you don’t complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it."
12, One opeadatire ??? .

18, "One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for six grade. I didnt want to go but I had to go I didnt have a choice so I get in the car and we drive to the doctors office. Finally we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours I didnt complain about it. The doctors comes out and I got scared but happy that finnaly its my turn. Then he called a different name so whe and my awesome mother kept on waiting in the waiting room, then my beloved mother tells @CAPS6 wow @CAPS1 your not complaining now. I know manages that’s because @CAPS2 becoming more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thank @CAPS3 the doctor calls my name “@CAPS1 @CAPS5.” @CAPS6 and my mom go in the room. The doctor says you grew she the last time seen you. Doctor is this going to hurt? No sweetie its not. Are you sure. Positive, ok , ready, ya. So I close my eyes and imagine something really nice.

Think you are the best doctor in the whole wide world I have ??? thank you cutie pie. Your very welcome."
10, "I am going @NUM1 write about a time when I was patient. My advocate @PERSON1 was soppese @NUM1 buy me some pens fo many of @DATE1 year as part of my @DATE1 money. I have been asking him everyday since then. “@PERSON2, @CAPS1 @MONEY1 do ur daily shopping yet”?  “no.” “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said “because I want my pens @CAPS4 @DATE1 present remember the @NUM3 owe me”. “@CAPS5 I do but be patient” “@CAPS6 ok my patients is about @NUM1 fall apart.”  I have been waiting ever since."
22, Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decide to be patient and read. Before I knew it we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.
14, "One time that l was patient was when we went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. We had to wait in line for an half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride. I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient. So for @NUM1 min once we got to the front of the line l couldn't wait. So I hurried up and got on then ride. I really didn't like that day when l had to stand up that long. But, that what patience means."
21, "My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and I’m not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didn’t break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do."
16, "When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren’t to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I’m not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope I’ll never have to do that again."
6, I am the type of person who you would call inpaient but I will try to explan it in the best way I can the only time I am patient is when something existing on tv comes on my frinds are always paient for everything @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and other things but I am never paient
24, "Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced of the arm rest with every one movement. I had asked my @CAPS1 to hurry up @CAPS2 I wouldn’t be late. I had told her like I have a million times before, “@CAPS1, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” @CAPS2 I sat there slummped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens @CAPS7 the time, I thought my @CAPS1 would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunatly, with every flip, I became more irretated. “@CAPS3 is she? Why is she taking @CAPS2 long?” @CAPS4 like these swirled in my head. Then, my @CAPS1 came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door crecked open. My @CAPS1 started the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasn’t going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes. Taking lots of deep breathes helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “@CAPS5 passient.” I told myself. “@CAPS5 passient. Relax, you’ll make it there.” @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient. Great job”"
18, "There was a person named @PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his @CAPS1- box @NUM1. But, his dad just got laid-off and his mom had a low-paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldn’t buy the game. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at @CAPS2. But, @PERSON1 still didn’t have enough money for the game. A few more months passed, @PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up loving the game very much."
14, "As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as I’m older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I don’t care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don’t want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and don’t say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help."
12, "Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1. I was patient on the way there. I was patient in line to get inside. I was patient in line to get on the dragster. I was patient to go on all the rides. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I was patient to go through security. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there. I was patient to get off. I was patient for my luggage. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting to  lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait till class is over. Like I said I am mostly patient."
20, "One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called “The @CAPS1 @CAPS2”. It’s also a tv show on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, brother of @PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldn’t die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don’t complain while doing it."
10, Pacience is a talent that is difficult to master. Pacience is a mental game. Pacience comes in everyones life. If you have no pacience then therefore you have more anger. Pacience for those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Pacience is required there also. Pacience is among people everywhere whether it’s waiting for a toy or waiting for god  to save your pacience is something that will stay here forever.
23, "For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunter’s orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in it’s place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things."
16, "This year mom maryed my new step dad. I guess he wanted ous to “bond so we took up trap shooting. It pretty much the same thing as skeet shoot, well actually is the same. Anyway he used to be a cop and had a shotgun so we went out and tried it. It didn’t work out. I missed every single bird I clay targets jet actped one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it I new I was bad because it was the first time. So we tried the hit the thing died center. I feelt shown up. We left that day with only ten hits and a uncountable amout of missis. I was feteling pretty low. Within the next week we tried again. He lanched the bird and it almost like in slow motion I whated it ark. I followed it with the ball at the end of the gun an pulled the triserand I watched the bird explode. Haha, I fanily did it? We lanched another and I hit it I went @NUM1 in arrow! Amazing for someone who missed all about a few be for And that’s how I was patient."
22, "@CAPS1 @CAPS1 my cell phone buzzes in my pocket. Lexa, @CAPS2. I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered once and said, I need sometime @CAPS5 be patient. She definetly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring."@CAPS3, Are you there?" she sounds desperate to call  me the nickname she always has ''yes''  ''I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it''. ''I told you I needed time and for you to be patient.'' I say almost in tears. ''I know but I can't be when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend''. ''Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complain''. ''@CAPS4''.  ''@CAPS5 try to be patient and @MONTH1 be you wouldn't be complaining''.  ''@CAPS6'' she saysl then hangs up. Sure I think I am so mad that she thinks she can @CAPS5 can and it would be all better. She should've waited. I fonly she'd been patient."
15, "I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results."

22, "Patience can lead to rewards, @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated but he just stayed calm and looked forward to meeting @PERSON3. One day @PERSON4 seen a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper. He put @NUM1 in the machine and opened the newspaper holder to grad one, it was jammed.  He went into the gas station to tell the people but they were not there, he hit the top of the bell and nobody came .@PERSON4 was trying to be as patient as possible .He went to a different store and got newspaper there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  was  that his favorite star ,@PERSON2 ,was going to be in town  .Can hurried  to buggle town and seen the line that was @NUM2 long ???.He was so excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 got to the line at @TIME2 and has been there for @NUM3 hour and she only got @NUM4 autographs done .This was going to be a long day for @PERSON4. @PERSON4 got a hot dog and  a soda from the sidewalle food business  at @NUM5 p.m .@PERSON4 was still the last person in line his patience went down quite a bit .At @TIME3 there were only @NUM6  people  including him there .

That is when @PERSON4 learned that patience can pay off in the end."
24, "Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “@CAPS1 you can get it this time.” I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I think. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. M y hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the  court. Since I was patient @NUM1 didn’t give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory."
17, "My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was @CAPS1 and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn @NUM1 pm because my best friend @DATE1 was going to pick me up in her pink convertibable and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only @NUM2 so I did my chores thinking time will fly by so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dish washer. I put grapes in the dish washer @CAPS2 the dish was hoe was done I empted it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I  looked at the clock and it was only @NUM3 the I remembered that my favour  movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran into the wall and got knocked out. After @NUM4 hours I  was fine so I told my mom that I will be patient because I don’@CAPS3 want to get knocked ???on the bright side I told myself I only have @NUM5 hours and @NUM6 minutes to go so I went to my room + wasted some @CAPS3.V. until eleven twenty so I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating but first before I did my make up I whent into the kitchen I put all the grape smelling dishes in the dishwasher and washed them them the I right way. Then I put my costum on I was a bumblebee, then I put my make up on I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to @NUM1 suddenley I heard a horn @DATE1 was here. So I got in the car + we went to pick cate. I almost forgot to tell you that @DATE1 was a ladybug, cate was a which so then we whent trick or treating. So thats a time when I was patient."
16, One day i spent a night over my bestfriends house for @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Mind you all of my clothes and shoes were over her house still. I wasn’t really able to get my clothes because right after school I went out to eat. I was really angry because I left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes so I called her and told her to bring them to school.The next day i was really looking foward to getting them and I comforted her about it and she says she forgot so I gave her until the @DATE1 and she still didn’t give them back. Notice I was very patient with her and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally she gave the back and you will never believe that am still friends with her because my shoes were worn out and dirty but I had to realize that she’s a good friend and im a patient person.
16, "Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous .I arrived at the dentist office , half scared  to death by the of the pain , there two people in front  of me so I had to wait , which made me more scared. The  time had come for me to go with the dentist . I was patient the whole  time .After it was done ,I was fine ,it didn’t even hurt .When I got home ,I fell asleep , I woke up in pain though ,my tooth felt on fire. I never complained though, and when my mom was trying to hurry and my medicine, I never yelled at her to hurry or cried .This was the time that I was patient."
18, "This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it bugs me really bad! Also I’ve been patient because I’m having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like it is taking for ever. At my sleepover there is going to be cake and ice cream! “@CAPS1!” I’ve also been patient because im turning twelve which means I will be patient. Then the day after my sleepover my mom, me and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies and I get a hundred dollars to speand. At the mall! It is very hard being patient to do fun things. Finally I’ve been patient by not asking everyone if they are coming. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it buss me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do fun things I have learned just recently."
18, Once in @NUM1 grade my teacher @PERSON1 “asked us to get an A.M.P out.” @CAPS1 we all did and quietly we started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last prebblem and I was thinking “man already to the end.” @CAPS1 I started to work on it I was @CAPS1 confused this probblem was like seventh grade work. @CAPS1 I rased my hand and waited to go on @PERSON1 my hand and told me to go on in my math but I told her “I can’t go on I am on my last problem.”  @CAPS2 @PERSON1 went on helping all of the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally after she went to eight other people she came and helped me. She showed me how to do the problem and I figured it out. That was the time I waited patiently.

16, "A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a @NUM1 hour flight with a two hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient because I really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. In the layover to pass time I listend to my ipod and used my macbook pro to get on face book. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind of @LOCATION2 and we were in @LOCATION2 in know time, and when we arrived my patient’s paid of because I got to swim on beaches and party I @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2 that is my story about a time I was patient."
9, Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @CAPS1 sometimes im not its better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient she will wait as long as she want. My other causins tell me to be patient and I will just be waiting for a while and I ask then hurry and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient and we tRied. So now I can stay longer being patient.
20, "I was in class waiting  I new that it would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to yet over. Which was math. Personally I didn't like math all that much so unfortunately l had to wait. @NUM1 more minutes and l was home free. The time had come and l was happy. @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS1 your folder away"" @CAPS2! I @CAPS1 it away faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus. So then in his voice he said ""You @MONTH1 go to lunch"" I hurried and I was going to be the first one there I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but l was. I booked it there home free. When l relized a figure in front of me. ""no"" l said. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastaded that is my story and I'm stick to it."
18, "In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 dinsney land. We got to the park and rode some rides .My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, space @CAPS2. I got in line and I saw a sign, @NUM1 hours until lift off! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disapointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was to big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stay. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fastoas for @NUM5 other rides! In the end my patience paid off."
21, "I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many expierences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, “@CAPS1!” or, “@CAPS2 onnn!” @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunatly, @PERSON1 wasn’t mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” @CAPS5 time she didn’t say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had expieriences with many patient people and @CAPS5 expierience turned out to be fun!"
23, "I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you don’t want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specaly at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to cedar point and I coun’t wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry mudines.  I got all of my close pack a week early because, I was so edsited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn’t so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our carso it didn’t take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the howtell it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 storys high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room ont @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wainted to buy the furry things but she couldn’t. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called million ofcare. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficutys  with the seatbelts and others technical difuctlelys sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is realy fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorow. And I got my hot dog.  That was my story of being patience at cedar point when all is you want to do was have fun. Sometimes you got to be patinced to get what you want."
23, "One hot @DATE1 day my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about @NUM2 outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I’m glad.  I didn’t chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it."
23, "Patient is a great thing. It means to be understanding and calm. Sometimes people can take difficulties and pain and still stay calm. Any time when your brother or sister annoys you your still patient and never little back. “@CAPS1! “@CAPS2 up already!! “@CAPS3 my brother.” @CAPS4 I ‘m awake! “I hollered. I took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a sigh. “I ‘m soo bred!” my brother shouted in my face, “can we @CAPS13 walking “I was counting past ten in my mind and then finally spoke “@CAPS7”. I got my coat off the rack followed by little brother. We walked outside right when we saw my mom coming to give meachore. “You’ll have to cut the grass to day and rake the leaves.” @CAPS5 said calmly,” @CAPS6 you walk your little brother “.  “@CAPS7”, I was completely furious @CAPS12 the inside. I tried to keep calm, but the that didn’t last long, “@CAPS8 @CAPS9!” my brothers friend said cheer fully, “can you come over and play?”@CAPS10 asked him my brother looked up at me and I was closing my eyes breaking wont out. “I stammered walking back home. I grabbed the learn mower and right when I was about to turn it @CAPS12 –“@CAPS11, get inside and start your home work. . . Then, you can not the down!”  “ One two. . There … “I counted silently. I walked with a fake grin @CAPS12 my face.” @CAPS12 the other hand … @CAPS13 take out the trash!”  “One hundred seventy-five…! Kept counting.

I sped inside to gaze at @CAPS24 had happened, it turnout my sister broke my x box @CAPS12 the tites because @CAPS5 wanted to play. If get passed @NUM1 in counting in my brain I ‘m going to @CAPS15! I thought. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom.” @CAPS5 broke my x box! “I repeated “@CAPS17 @CAPS7, your dat will fix it . “@CAPS5 said calmly “@CAPS19 @CAPS13 get your brother,”  “@CAPS4 … “I speed walked down to my brothers’ friend house and told him I had to get my brother. “@CAPS7”…  @CAPS22! @CAPS10 shouted “your brother is here to get you.” “@CAPS23!” I urged to stay silent and patient and I managed to. We walked back home and I threw my self @CAPS12 my bed. “@CAPS24 a borins day! “I spoke to myself. “I don’t think I ‘m ever going to be this patient in my life again!! And I smacked my head @CAPS12 the pillow and said “@CAPS25 @CAPS26! “and went to bed. Wow! @CAPS24 a day! Patience means to be understanding and calm. Patience great. I tried and learned a powerful lesson, always try. My life is way better @CAPS19 I bays try to stay patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they get me @NUM2 mad sometimes. The @CAPS26 would be better if everyone would just stay patient, people have to try to checeed, it’s a very very famous phrase."
16, "Hi my name is @PERSON1 and I’m going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldn’t even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my mom’s and dad’s room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents."
21, "There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 live around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of fish are in the desert, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. At was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling fiercly when @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finnaly free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice. @CAPS6 ate a couple of fish and slept. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breath and @CAPS6 was in a not @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died."
20, "In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasn’t the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didn’t make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he should’ve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didn’t quit or tell himself that he wasn’t good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3’s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star."
24, I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didn’t even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said “you’ll shoot you eye out side.” @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time I’m going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.
11, "The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you don’t ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you don’t get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you don’t get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you don’t get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosn’t pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something that’s a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe wan’t to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients."
18, "There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go so his family went. It had opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They didn’t think there was going to be a line. They got there and they didn’t see any cars in the drive thru. They went through the drive through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they say about @NUM2 cars. He was really mad. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt everyone was picking their food very slowely. They where also making the food very slowely. Then people started yelling, “@CAPS1 up,” they where also honking their horns but he was the only who wasn’t honking his horn. They where waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 had gone @CAPS3. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt.  When it was his turn the cashier said, “@CAPS2 you for being very patient.” @CAPS3 the time they got their food it took @NUM6 hour. The food wasn’t even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didn’t honk his car horn and he wasn’t yelling. He had stayed in the car @NUM6 hour and he was starving. It is a great thing to have patience."
11, I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.
14, "Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go a friend's house. Savannah dad is a firefighter and he had to put out of fire a could not pick me up to the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned Patience is a way of life people have to live with and this is the time I had to live with it."
16, "Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you a time I was patient. Once I had a dentists apointment was @NUM1 am and my apointment was at @NUM2 am. Me and my dad sat and waited until @NUM2. It was hurting. I didn’@CAPS1 have anything to do. I don’@CAPS1 read magazines, they didn’@CAPS1 have a @CAPS1.V or anything. I was really hungry because I didn’@CAPS1 have any breakfast. @NUM4 am still in waiting. I couldn’@CAPS1 do it. It was so bored until I remembered I had a @CAPS2  @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast. That’s the time I was patient."
8, "Patience is truly the hardest thing and body really ? that a ?.I hard to because im on punishment for not doing what I was suporse to do. So I have to be patient it and what it out until it was being patient it is what for a perfect of team to did. From my pop it of how. So while im on punishment I just waiting it out so my time will come because I can’t speed up there and just make it ??? quicker but it  I could  I would but  for now I have to want. Im a permanent for quite a while so I can just be patient .I know before taking it hard but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to do it patience also helps the maker  and cam saved you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can want for certainly things like; money, clothes, shoes, homes, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transportation, and things of the sudn because at you post rush every thing you want get it the way you were surpose to but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!"
18, "A time when had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 it’s about @NUM1 hrs away. So I had to sit in a car for @NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your ipod and sleep. Which I didn’t do either of those things. As you can tell it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed it would have felt like @NUM4 if you weren’t doing anything. By that time I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping. I knew I couldn’t do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried looking out the window but that made me sleepy. Getting there took too long. Finally @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had patience"
13, Patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital I blacked out and hit my chin on the door so we had to stay their for about an hour. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient.
12, "Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just can’t stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. I’m around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen."
7, Time I was patient was when my friend was coming over I was excited. But I waited and waited. But she finna @CAPS1. Thats about it.
20, "A time I was patient was at my friend cousins birthday party. I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when your patient you get what you want more often."
20, "Being patient is important, as I’ve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn’t get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1’s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend’s birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldn’t fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards."
16, "There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldn’t go on to the next part. Also we couldn’t talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldn’t talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didn’t no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year I’m alway patient. That a story on when I’m patient."
18, "@NUM1 Patience is when you understand and you donâ€™t complain. A person who is patient is some     one who can wait and they donâ€™t while every two second. A person like that can succeed in life. @NUM2 @CAPS1! @PERSON2 was getting was getting closer. First @PERSON6 then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She was coming town my row next. This was a night more. When is someone going pinch me go I wake up. @NUM3 â€œ@PERSON5.â€� @PERSON3 and with a disappointed force â€œ@CAPS2 did a poor set on this festâ€�. I think you should pet on. In my mind I was praying for her not to say the word, she responded, â€œ@CAPS3.â€� When I got home my mom mad the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fall history. Next week the out or came. We sat down she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big with looked like my lips were about to fall off. @NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally the hundred points there came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going in wish it he met me! A week later @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face good job @PERSON5 you got an A-. It was hard in the begging but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 wait and donâ€™t hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant. A person who is patient is a person who accomplishes a goal."
16, One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad @CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I waited until @CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents @CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.
8, When you have patience you are colmer peace full and happy. It is like when you  birth day is next week and you don’t want to wait for it and have to get mad be cases you want your presents today not next week. But you can’t so you get mad start to hit things and than you don’t get a good behaver. Then you make your parents made then they bring some of you gifts back to they store that is not patience. That is non patience when you get mad becomes   you can’t get what you want.
16, "Patience, having patience means you don’t complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like .  You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in a extremely long line and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “ @CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5.” Or, “ @CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave.” @CAPS3’t @CAPS6 just @CAPS9?” Your @CAPS1 would be thinking, “ @CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldn’t ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn’t want @CAPS8 be patient or you would wan’t @CAPS8 be inpatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression.So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying,’’@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9,@CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!” @CAPS10 you wait very impatiently. Although, patience is basically like a kind , gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, your picturing yourself screaming at someone who you’re waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting. So, having patience is a good thing. Try, it sometimes just don’t let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside."
14, This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didn’t want it so I wasn’t anxious to get it. That kind of worked. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isn’t as fun as I thought it would be.
18, Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.
23, "One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were asleep. Our parents were on the computer. @CAPS4 usually don't stay up that late. So I just thought @CAPS2 was doing something for work. In the @TIME1, when we wake up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder @CAPS3 it could be…."" I thought. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""@CAPS3's going on!?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowely brought up a document from behind his back presenting it to us. The heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking @CAPS11 @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in amazement. @CAPS11 if we were reading each other's mind, we both well knew that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the @CAPS15 on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2.'' it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!.""  ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" @CAPS11 normal kids did. I said ""@CAPS12…"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 knew @CAPS9 disappointment and said ""@CAPS14 things come to those who wait. I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to rough the two months out and be patient. The first couple weeks felt like mont's to us. We were oh so anxious @CAPS11 you would guess. But, @CAPS11 time progressed the patient got easier. I was able to focus on other things beside the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time come for us to head on a plane for the cruise."" That quick! It went by that quick! I m so excited, @CAPS2! I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You we're patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! @CAPS11 @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS14 things will come to those who wait."""
14, "Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1’s a good one to have too, @CAPS1 can help you in a lot of situations. If gas have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didn’t think about @CAPS1 that much so @CAPS1 didn’t really get to me. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep @CAPS1 off my mind. I had to make sure I didn’t think about @CAPS1, so I wouldn’t beg my friend to know what @CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and got on there nerves. @CAPS1’s good to be patient with friendhips, so you dont become mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS1’s @CAPS2 not good to be impatient with your family. If your patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused."
16, "It was my family vacation, we was going to @CAPS1 point. We was staying in the magical hotel is was, was beautiful you can see a real waterfall and it like haven. We was in this huge room it have @NUM1 huge bathroom and bigs @CAPS2. Then as I look out of the window I can see rolercoster and all kind of ride. But they have come with these knew ride call the @CAPS3 breaker: it @NUM2 hundred feet tall and big as the statin of libaty and it pikes you up drop you @NUM2 hundred feet twist like a! Tarnado. It move from sides to side. Me and my mom and dad went there, we want to ride. But @NUM4 people wateing in line. My parent wont use to ride a different ride but I wanted to rid this. So I got in line and wait, I knew I have to be patient but @NUM1 hours pass I start to loss my patient. There was only @NUM6 people in front of me. Finaly it was my turn, I got on it, frist laft me up @NUM7 hundred. Feet and dropedme, spin the around, twist me until I got tired and finally I got off it. You can see me crying but it was not a bad cry, it was a good cry so that was the time I was patient"
16, "Every year since I learned a bout @LOCATION1 and presents, now that I think about they never said you’d have to wait months until @CAPS1 came around. I love @CAPS1 but once a year or so @CAPS2 patient enough to wait until @DATE1 downward. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 told me @CAPS1 was coming along with all we decorating ,carolling  and wistfull of @CAPS1 joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snow ball wars with my cousins. I still feel temptation trying to rush time and make me anxious and grueling to wait so long but @CAPS2 still patient and try to let the temptation go away. When @CAPS1 eve came I feel greatful I made it this long with patients because @CAPS2 just like my parents and cant wait for anything that takes month. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leave quicker, then I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying time file sometime  having fan."
24, "Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old I was extremely patient about an @CAPS1 toy I wanted. Ever since @CAPS1 The @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender was on television and In stories now I was crazy about them and I still am today the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the only person in the @CAPS1 world who can master all four element @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 . Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 had set on t.v. so I asked my mom could she buy it. And she said when I get the money, but until then no. so of course I was upset. So I was waiting counting until the days went buy. Then final that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. “@CAPS11 @CAPS12” the @CAPS12 has arrived the @CAPS12 I get my toy but I didn`t know that she only got two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12 and when my birthday was here can guess what…? I finally got the best of all. The @CAPS4 and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted."
9, Being patience is a good thing because if you are and then you are in some rough time in life. Patience people can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be herd. There are some people that can’t what there for three hours. There are some people that can’t what there for ten minets. These people get made at that and they will just give up. But after all of those people that can and can’t people cant quit. People what there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that can’t do it but they do. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can’t do it.
19, "A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day she when I woke up I woke up to early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at @NUM1 am. So at @NUM2 am I called her but she didn’t answer. So then I just was watching, tv and playing my game. Then around @NUM3 pm my aunt called back sayin she had to go to the store. so now my fusteration started to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you goin and how long your gonna be gone. but I was trying to be patient. Now at @NUM4 my mom said lets go! Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm. Now I was real angry because she had not even called since we was gone. So I called her and she said she comin down the street. I was so happy so later on that day I had fun with my couisins and aunt."
21, "Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy."
16, "A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side I’m on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true.” even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didn’t move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends."
24, "Have you ever been patient before? Well l have l was sitting there in a nice warm and cozy seat exhausted dozing off waiting for them to say the came @PERSON1. It kept going throught my mind @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so l just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silence orthodonist office. I kept asking myself things like I wonder what their gonna do today, I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces. Then l starting to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out ""@CAPS1"" l was excited and nervous at the same time but l was proud because l had sat there the whole time patiently."
22, "One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldn’t wait so I asked her when and she said she didn’t know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didn’t have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldn’t randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didn’t have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because that’s better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been."
12, "One of the many times I was patience was when my @CAPS1, my @CAPS2 and I went to a restrant. We oderd our food and found a tabil. We were siting there waiting  for the food. I ask my @CAPS1 ""@CAPS3 much longer its going to take?"" @CAPS4 said ""you have to be pactien and waitie"". And then a little after the our food was done. It was toatlly worth it."
17, "Being patient isn’t always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with @NUM1 rude, screaming and crying kids for @NUM2 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great @CAPS3 davn in???. with my grandpa. My @CAPS1 pa is fan bag to talk to, @CAPS2 later than I found out my @NUM1 younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @CAPS2 my cousins brought??? loud noisy and flossy toys they bot just for the ride. As we started heading for @LOCATION1 I turned my ipod on and found out it only had @PERCENT1 battery left. Half way there I was almost dad of borden, @CAPS2 the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I auske is a sobbery slap to the face, “were here” my cousin enchoired, finally I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore, and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my @CAPS3, it was about @NUM4 hrs and my cousins were all asleep again and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home."
18, "One some day, it was about @NUM1. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I don’t know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big @CAPS1 on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars,” where are we?”I ask “six flags.” @CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatience people all around me. They were thinking screaming and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seem like we were moving faster than @CAPS3 of the fast people, and we was one of the first people to get in first. That was the @CAPS3 impatience group of people I’d ever seen."
11, I’m always patient I’m really patient until my birthday then when I get presents I don’t need to be patient anymore because I wait a year for presents and then I wait for @CAPS1 because its only like a month away from my birthday And this year I’m being patient until @CAPS1 because I’ve already know what I’m getting. But that what I’m patient for just about nothing else I’m patient for.
6, Patience is something or someone who like waiting for someone or something patience part of life I sometime don’t have patience but I should have patience without patience you will get not because something in lift you have to want for and that is why you should have patience.
14, "Today I’@CAPS3 going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like @CAPS3.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesn’t await in a long line for a corn dog.Now I’@CAPS3 starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn’t mind to wait for me when I have to do something."
4, Patience not all of us have it. It is hard to learn theme but even harder to master theme. It is all ways a good time to use your patience.
17, "When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for youth group at my church I took some o my friend. In the maze we had to go as a group of @CAPS2 & me, my dad, @PERSON1, & @CAPS3 went in one group @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 in the group be hind us. Half way thru the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy casing us with a chain saw & then @PERSON1 smacked my glass of my face so we had to stop that @ORGANIZATION2 of the @ORGANIZATION2 so we could find them & just before we found them my friends in the @CAPS6 group came & had to wait @NUM1 minutes wich seemed long. So they didn’t get chance to get chaced by the guy with the chainsaw."
18, "Have you ever been patient or been told your patient? Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it."
12, "Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something . Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patient at all. Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. That’s what patient is to me."
9, One time I were a patient was when I broke my arm. I was there for @NUM1. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole and I droped down and I put a @CAPS1 on it and it swore up. My doctor was very peaceful. And nice. In conclusion this is a time I was a patient
20, There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.
10, "Sometimes I done show patience and sometimes I Do. Being patience is being @CAPS1, @CAPS2, And @CAPS3 the good charater traits that a leader has. Without patience you’ll @CAPS5 up at every thing hard you Do. So be leader, a person who @CAPS4’t @CAPS5 up.Be a person who you love in addition be every thinG you can be. Remember, patience is every thing."
13, "@CAPS6 was @NUM1 at night, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldnâ€™t go to sleep at all, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyoneâ€™s sprit @CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you.sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider)  for @CAPS1 I am patient with others others  because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year, donâ€™t you? @CAPS6 is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time @CAPS9"
18, "Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1 she lived with her dad and mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was mom in a small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her birth and she was so exited for this birthday because she was turning twelve. Twelve was here luckey number ever sience she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and go to chef @PERSON1 and eat out she agreed so that morning she woke up and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberrys on them she went out to go milk there cows for her parents. @CAPS1 hated milking there cows because they are very stuburn so she went out there and miked the cows in only @NUM1 minetts. @CAPS1 went back inside and put the milk on the table. @CAPS1 was starting to wonder if she was going  to get a birthday present, @CAPS1 decided it would be best if she was patient when her mom came home from work (she works at a dress making store) she said, “Are you ready to go eat,” @CAPS1 jumped “And yeld yes, yes. So they rode in to town and parked at the restaurant, they walked in and the lights are off her dad got the light switch and all of her cloose family and friends where there and they yelled “sprise” @CAPS1 was is such a shock she yelled “@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, and on a table was twelve presents, and under the table was a dog. Her mom & dad got her a dog. She name the dog wonder because every time she saw him she began to wonder about her  wonderful life. And she learned that great thing come when you are patient."
13, Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION1 state game. My dad was Patient and that is unusual because he is normally in patient. So we where surprised. when we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and @CAPS1 sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move it took about a half in hour for them to find as and again my dad was patient but the @CAPS1 at us could not wait and we started to set very angry when security got there  we had to wait for them to ghoole our rist barn he was still patient and after that we got a seats I was slat but the rezzon my dad was patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium so he stayed  patient and stayed calm.

24, "I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little bit scared. I didn’t know what was going on to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was waiting  for the contest to end .A little bit earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place .I was nervous .I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?"
16, "When I was patient. It was this @DATE1 we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It to took us @NUM1 hours to get there but we said forget it we were in @LOCATION1. But we were not in @LOCATION1. It was @NUM2 minight, we were so sleepy we went to holiday inn and wonce we got to the room we went stright to sleep then that morning we went swimming then we lift and went to @LOCATION1 pack. My two cuzins were gotten on my nervs I was about to kill bouth of them they kept fighting and talking about each outher. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm we had to take a little train to get there. The park was huge. The first ride me and my sister and my lil cuzins was the commet. The we got on the, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 runney foleon, and the @CAPS2 and that was a time which I was patient"
22, "There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 pug puppies from a nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!"
17, "Sometime it can be hard to be patient, @CAPS1 me it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C.I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet president @PERSON1 face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the white house a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited played hangman and saws other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around @NUM1:30pm @PERSON1 came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?""I said ""yes""….we went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry @CAPS1 having to wait, but I didn't care it care it was worth it."
16, "Today was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, the @PERSON2, was so excited, he was bounded off line walls!  “I wonder @CAPS8 @PERSON3 will bring us,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1, looking through a cat dog,”I want this and this, and this, oh, definently this.” “@PERSON1, you need to be patient. @CAPS1 is tomorrow and you need to do your share and help clean the tree,” @PERSON1’s mother says. “@CAPS4 I went presents now! “ @PERSON1 whines. “You know, “his father says with again, “@CAPS5 you aren’t a good @PERSON2 santa will only bring you peanat shells.” @CAPS6, @PERSON1 gives in and sets, ‘@CAPS7 alright I’ll help.” @CAPS8 seemed like many many hours later to @LOCATION1, it as time to go to bed. He was many that he had been patient, because he koew, in the @TIME1, he would have presents."
11, My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop she calls @NUM1 hours of waiting not a long time. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores she dozent get very upset she just ask me to do it again. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work because she does not get frustrated when  she has a lot of work to do like writing  a @NUM2 word paper
14, "Patience is??? our or waiting???Patience is dealing with teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your younger sitting or young??? teacher would  constantly be  fighting. That’s why patience is as important. Patience should be constantly exconsiled. In sports it helps??? you need to basic the rer whether its a good or bad call. Patience also???because you’re not going  to be ??? of it the first ???.Patience makes perfect.

In the end it’s a ?? to call you ??. its very important to have that ??? whether its small things ??? Learning or big things like testing. Its rather to have patience than not."
17, "This story a story about when I broke my ankle. It happened about @NUM1 years ago. I was at swim practice and was about to dive off of lane @NUM2. When I lost my balance getting on the block, I realized I was about to fall and tried to catch myself, but, I ended up falling in to the water and twisted my and backwards from the swim black. I was really hard to get out of the water. My mom called the doctor and found out that I couldn’t got an ??? for nearly ??? days. So she came to the pool to get me and brought her old ??? those @NUM3 days passed of laying in my bed @NUM4 when I come to find out that my ankle was broken. So I ended up spending @NUM5 weeks not going to swim practice, I was so bored. That was the time when I had to be patient for four days until I got an x-ray."
19, "There was this day not to long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were finding out if we made the team. I had to wait, and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself… I wonder I wonder if I pushed enough I wonder if I messed up to much.” @CAPS1 I could think about were the mistakes I made so that day @TIME1 that I had been sitting down waiting to here my name… I had my name! “ @PERSON1 number @NUM1 tryouts please come get your paper.” I got it, took it outside, opened it, and read. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 you had made the goled team.” I jumped up and down. That day I had my patients, and there  for. I made the team."
6, A time of be patience when is all the time if you was not patience you will run all time. (I have here there). You will never have time for your family and your self like my tell me when I’m eat “slow down your not going no where”. If your food was about go some where you will not because you are to tried to do it. All way take your time t learn how to be patience it is easy just take your time.
17, "Patientce I was patient when I did not want to go wisconsic. Iwas patient on my way there (driving). I was possent when I was fishing, not complaining now boring it is. I wasnt about sleep on @CAPS1 ground. The whole camping trip I was patient. Story begins. @STATE1, took @NUM1 hours. In the car had a t.v. I wolened that for while and then I looked outside and say a moose! I screamed, ''moose!!'' my rooms boyfriend, mike stoped and backed up and that was my first time saw a moose. Then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient for the fishing to bite my wom. I was so patient I got @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back i had to sleep on the groind. There was bumps and rocks under me, but didn't complain because thak how comping is. The next day we were on our way back and I couldn't fina the t.v. and didn't have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, a @CAPS2 station on exit @NUM3''. I was patient went to the bathroom and to get a water."
3, I do not have patience.
14, "This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year I’m pretty sure every one knows about it. It is call birthday. Every year I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off. Another way that  I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over . But I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there do the work and be patient."
19, "I played soccer for a rec.Team called the cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible you could be in. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and me were doing all the work no one else on the team were not doing anything. So I decide to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in. When try outs came I was really nervous. After I tryed out for three days, if you were selected you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took long time to get a phone call it felt like it took a country. In between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, when you wait for a long period of time thats called patience."
15, "I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn’t like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm."
17, "(waiting) (healt beatina ) “@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your repolt cords”. said @PERSON2hemlock. I @PERSON1 was the last one in line. “@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12, keepup the good work!” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS4!!!!” I said screaming happily I ran home going straitght A’@CAPS12” “@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1.” @CAPS7 mom aya said . I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 saying, “@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12! but can I older something from the internet for @MONEY1?” “@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A’@CAPS12 tudent. I placed @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 week it…???"
13, A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate compition in @CAPS1 the registration line was almost by @CAPS2 I stood there  for almost an hour but when I got up there & paid my fee it was all worth it because I got to compete against my best friends.
24, "Once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters both @NUM1(one year older than @PERSON2) there name were @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house is an old house located in the woods. One day @PERSON2 went out to get the mail, and a man with a tuxedo on gave her a letter that looked very fancy. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it said “@CAPS2 @PERSON2, your invited to ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm.” @PERSON2 screamed in exitment. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beatifulgown but it was to much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price was I she helped around the store for a couple of days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And fonaly her patients paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home and put the dress on. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put her makeup and jewelry on and looked at her self in the mirror and said I did it. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the gold paint. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs and every one stared. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce him self and when she turned around he fell in love. @PERSON2 couldn’t believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her will you marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true."
10, "Patience is probalbly  one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probalbly like you more, for example, if you are in line for something at school, and you were patient, you will probalbly get a “@CAPS1 you” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park ride’s line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldn’t want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important."
16, One time when I was patient was my birthday I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone and that’s all I wanted. All of my friends had them I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn’t know where I was. It is just a need right now because they are very helpful. My birthday was  on a @DATE1 so the night before I was at the football game everybody was asking if I was going to get me and I kept on telling  them yes I’m getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift that I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and I started to get all of my friends numbers. I learned when your patient and not asking you will get what you want.
19, "Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a gon??? and your not patient maugio wait  your turn here not going to hire you, here not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldn’t go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn’t take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I and to finish packing ?????????? so I  was really tired and  ?????????? show I was ran because it was  a hour left. When I was done packing. I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I can’t go to sleep under a ????????. Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said “let’s go.” I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience."
21, I was patient when I was at my friend’s house in the winter shoveling a sleding slot so we can but water on it to make ice. When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didn’t bother me at all. That’s how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But… I couldn’t  or we couldn’t go on it that night because it was to late. I that’s my story about  patientce  The @CAPS1
16, "I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatience just waiting their. But sudden ly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just reilized it was a hour we been waiting. Under standing in patience means you know why you have to stand their waiting. Because you can’t push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you can’t do or get what ever you wan’t unless you truble. You can’t hit, cut, push, or shuve to the front of the line, you just have to wait."
21, "Being patient requires a lot of tolerance. For most people @CAPS6's hard to be patient but sometimes @CAPS6 is very important. A few weeks ago my neighbor really needed a break from her @NUM1 year old daughter @CAPS1. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know @CAPS2 I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She start crying so bud I loud no idea @CAPS2 to do. My mom came rushing in the room in panic mode."" @CAPS2's going on? Is everything ok in here"" she asked. I told her that everythings fine but @CAPS1 is just really cranky. My mom replied ""let's take her to the park she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. If noticed @CAPS1 likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat done, getting on the swings and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever. I love watching @CAPS1 but if I didn't have patient @CAPS6 would be extremely difficult."
15, "I have a lot of patience for example one I really wanted to know @CAPS1 I made volleyball team, and I had patience, I did not complain. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have Patience they kept asking what we are going to get @CAPS1 both were complaining they did not have Patience. Another example is we’re going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 and we still had planned the day I did not have ruler here that time, and it made it worse leaving the patience the more thinking about it and that made it work .Men @CAPS1 sometimes more  on and patient and sometimes not so much"
16, "A time when patient was when I went to the glasses place, And I had to get approved to get glass. So the next day my grandma call and ask did @PERSON1 get approved and they said “@CAPS1”, my grandma asks how long do I have to wait and they said four weeks so a week went by and they called and said my glasses are done. So the next day we went and got them and that was a time I was patient."
17, "Everyone should have patience. Living patience will help you because your going to have to be patient sometimes. Sometimes some people can be patience and some people can't be patient and which l am one of these people. Quite sometime l can be patient and can't be patient. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome. Well, l didn't! for once l was patience in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through the door and finally hold the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because l had to be at a @CAPS1 appointment in about @NUM1 min and it was a lot of them. It took about almost @NUM2 min to wait for all at them to get through the door. But l still continued holding the door after holding the door I was late for my @CAPS2 dppointment all it was still so if a commin ?? holding the door"
18, "One time I was patient was last year when I was at a amusment park in @LOCATION2 callnt cedarpaint. I was slunting in line to get to get on a amazing lollermaster called the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 force. It was a very tuff ride and delitedly ?? in the ?? but it was ten hours long. Standing in the hot unbearableline hurts ,horid, ussually when in @LOCATION1"
24, "It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldn’t wait till I could open them. I’ve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didn’t stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. “@CAPS1” I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied “@CAPS2 can’t afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. “@CAPS3” thank you “mom” I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the?? I got the wii and it ??, which was @MONEY1. I couldn’t believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and @CAPS4 enjoying every second of it."
19, "A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldn’t just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world."
12, "Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate."
21, "One day in the beginning of foll, @PERSON1 was watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn’@CAPS1 wait to see the movie that night. Finally the time come to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1  was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her lime. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn’@CAPS1 get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient."
21, "One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother was patient."
16, "Can you @CAPS1 a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time. I had to wait for a long time. Do you think you knew what it is?” it was @CAPS2 eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke upon @CAPS2 eve couldnt wait till tomorrow. I told my self that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time but that didn’t help because it was freezing out side. So had to come right back in the house. I didn’t have nothing to do. So I just kept wait, then “@CAPS4” my brother got up and I just played with him the whole day till we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight up to my bed room and got right to bed and woke up the next morning and I was so happy that I  didn’t had to wait anymore. I had to wait for ever I was  so happy that day but know @CAPS5 thirteen and I real don’t care anymore but I would still love to hear about your step to someday."
8, One time I was pacient was when my mum said that she would buy me a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I waited and waited and waited and wated for her but I knew I had to be pacient because she was going through hard times.
13, These storys is about times when I was patient. This is one story so one time my guardaner was puting my winter clothers away this @DATE1 and I told her like these my good clothes and I was like there not really winter clothes she said she know and she said im just puting them up because she said I had to many shrits that was same clolor and I was trying talk back then I was like o I see what you saying because I couldent fit every thing in my dresser so I patient and help her put my clothes up. Patient mean can you do something somebody ask you or can you do the right thing to people. Or can you help somebody when you think they help in something.
11, Once upon a time I was at the doctor and it was very crowned it. So well my mom went to go give the boy the information about me I was sitting down by this lady and her daughter was crying  when my mom came back and the doctors was calling  names I was trying to be patient so I got up went and the kids play area and started to play. A couple minutes later the doctors finally call my name so we got there at @NUM1 the doctors call me at @NUM2 pm. So they gave me a shot sat and the room for @NUM3 minutes they gave me some modsers and told me to go get the parstarch and to get problem want me to go to @CAPS1/ pharmacy and that’s the time I was being patient.
19, "Playing hockey is importint to me. I am a goaltender playing for farmington hills. Playing goal takes skill having “thick skin” and most impotantly being patient. Every game day @CAPS2 dad tells me “be cool, calm and colected” the three @CAPS1’s (as I call it). I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come @CAPS2 way. Once it does I am in action. The pirod ends and I wait patiently. The second pirod is here I stand waiting  the drop of the puck hopeing we scare. @CAPS3!!! @CAPS3!!! @NUM1 to @NUM2 @CAPS2 patientness helped it’s @NUM1 to @NUM2! The third pirod comes @CAPS3!! Big @CAPS4 by @ORGANIZATION1 (thats me)! @CAPS3!! Goooaaalll!! @NUM5 to @NUM2. thats it the game is over! I wated patiently to get that win aganst the @LOCATION1. After the game we all go and party at @CAPS5 @CAPS6’s house to celebrate a big win. And we all had a really great time doing it too."
20, "Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just don’t have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn’t know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, “@CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him?” then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we won’t talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasn’t patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldn’t tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that we’re both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people can’t have patience when they want to become friends."
15, I felt a thrill in my body. We were @NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @NUM2 minutes to go on space mountain. I wish I could’ve cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. A the end of the day I beged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of @CAPS1. Then at the end it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
24, "Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what they’re doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party – babysitting requires a lot of patience!"
17, "A time when I was patience. I was going school shoping. There were maybe over a hundred people in the store @PERSON1. It was like a duster of pebles in the sand. You could barly go down. The illes. It was like a whole mall in one little store. Some people would leave because how many people where in there. Then even more would come. It was me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 dad. We started stuff out. We got in line behind maybe @NUM1 people or more. @CAPS1 mom was ready to explode. So @TIME1 only @TIME1 people had gone. @CAPS1 mom almost fell asleep I was just standing there waiting. But @CAPS1 armys hurted and @CAPS1 back herted. She was so ready to get out of that store. @CAPS1 dad was reading a magizene while he was waiting.  Espn news to be exact. These were only a few people infront of use. I was happy that we could finally get @CAPS1 clothes. We get up to by @CAPS1 clothes and a cash register braekes. The lady said it will take a hour or two so @CAPS1 mom starts to complain. We sat in line a hour and half for this to happen. “@CAPS1 dad was fine with it because he was so into that magizene I could not belive that this happed I was so disapointed I was ready so was @CAPS1 mom so mom so we got @CAPS1 dad and left. @CAPS1 dad said”“I am at the good part.”I didn’t get the clothes that day but we went new week to get them."
12, "One time when I waited game but I couldn’t get yet .So I asked  my mom if can she buy me a new game, how much does it cause? @NUM1 dollars then she said you have to wait for some days the @NUM2 went by then I finally asked my mom can she buy for me she said well yet .I said thank you .Then the next morning we went to the game store, then I saw the game I wanted,I told my mom that we went to the counter and bought my game ."
14, The doctor appointment. Oct @NUM1 @DATE1 me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctors. Once we got their it was so crowded. I felt like we had been their for weeks days even @CAPS1 their were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted I was still waiting for my turn to see the doctor @NUM2 mins later still not my turn I was trying my hard to be patient but it didn’t help at all with all the noise of the kids running around tell ???. I walked up to the regiester and that’s where I found out my appointment I want till @NUM3 oclock and it was only @NUM4.
20, "Patience someone was patient with me when I did not understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher did not complain about helping me. Along with the students in the room. When the teacher was helping me they sat and quietly did there work. The teacher understand that I did not understand @CAPS1 to do the work. It was during math. We were tarning about positive and negitive  intergers. My question was, ''@CAPS1 do you order them from last to greatess''. She replied , ''I asy would you like me to show you?'' I said , ''@CAPS2 please''. So for about @NUM1 minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did there work. That is one time when people were patient with me."
6, Where do I begin there wasn’t ever. A time when I was patient. I was alway rushing people do something and getting mad cause they wouldn’t do it fast enough or go fast enough for me. I would just get attitude. That why I cant be patient and now you know why. The end. The teaching on the way people coming i.e ???.
17, "One time my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). “@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4” as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy “@CAPS7, @NUM1” the lady said. “@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order,” she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food. That was the time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1’s???"
16, "One rainy afternoon on a @DATE1 my little brother‘s friends mum called and needed me to babysit. She and my mom were going to soon and wouldn’@CAPS1 be back till nine p.m so she needed me to come over. So my mom move me over there and dropped me off at seven p.m went through after a brief entry on what to do if there is an emergency. When they left, me and the kids wrestled and watched @CAPS1.v.  We ran around, talked each others (mainly they tackled me) and I lifted them upside down, then at light thirsty of put them in bed and cover them everytime twice. After they brushed their teeth and went to bed, a walked down there twice to read my book. I’l out really sighed and or i turned on the @CAPS1. v need a col of patience afraid coz my mm for get me back."
21, "There is time in everyones life were they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn how to tye his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isn’t. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn’t get it. We hit the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When it came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudley."
16, "When I was patient, we were onone way to @CAPS1 point: with @LOCATION1 her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us @NUM1 hours to get there. @LOCATION1 and I were very patient we wated and waited to get there we were soo exited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a hole bunch of rollercoaster. We all waited in line about @NUM2 hours for every ride it was extra buisy that day. @LOCATION1 and I wanted to ride the tallest rollercoaster. It was called the @CAPS2 the @CAPS2 was @NUM1 @NUM4 it was the tallest rollercoster. I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a @NUM5 hour wait it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait!"
24, "@PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear middle school @CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girlâ€™s choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. â€œ@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.â€� I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1â€™s friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1â€™s better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now itâ€™s @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself donâ€™t be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasnâ€™t because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1â€™s I have a note taped to it. It reads â€œ@CAPS3 me your phone number and Iâ€™ll call you for the @NUM1.â€�. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think heâ€™s testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didnâ€™t ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.â€™ When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word. Yes!"
19, "One day my grandfather and I went fishing my grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, “that will take far ever just catch some fish.” I told him that was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something pulling at my fishing rod I taint to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles bitting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 inch white bass it was the biggest fish I ever caught before but it weren’t a turtle. After I caught that fish I said it’s time for a break time. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was jacking around and catching fish. At the time I was finshing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling.  I had to grab my fishing rod and ??? in my fish but it weren’t a fish it was a baby turtle."
14, "Being patient is very difaclut. I was a the store with my mom, and of course @CAPS1 was taching forever. “come on mom lets go do we really need this stuff” @CAPS1 just continued shoping. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought about throughing a fit. Finally, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said give me your phone. “@CAPS2 why”? The way you ackted in that store was horibal now I no I will alway be patient with my mom."
15, "Every year I go to my dads. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop ta the border. The border takes @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient, with them. On our way @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some argueing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour every ones patients were running low, so my dad kept repeating keep patient, keep patient over and over. We finnaly past the boarder everyone cheerd. So keeping patience is not the easyiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it."
17, A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasn’t one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I’ll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. That’s a time where I was patient.
23, "I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cusins house. It was very boring though. I was also sad and lonly, at thetime . so I am going to tell you. It was not long ago ,I was at my cusins house .Everyone except me .There were not enough four whielers ,so I was the only one left out .I felt so lonly .I couldn’t believe how I was bored I was .All I could do was woch with envy .Everyone was having fun except for me .Everyone was screaming with joy and lafing intill they would cry because they were having so much fun .Then my dad ???a corner of cunies for me .I smile to try to look like I am having fun then  he asks me if I want to go I say yes !

14, "When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We dint have to wait a long time , @CAPS1 my ride we ??? to wait a longtime  to get on @CAPS1 my friend  was very patiente and I was not. I kept complaining on how long it took. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. It was horrible waiting, @CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world."
23, "One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient."
20, "One @CAPS1, I was very patient when our flight got @CAPS2. We were going to @LOCATION1 that @CAPS1 when all of a sudden the @CAPS2 sign came up on the @CAPS5. I was kind a sud but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was ??????& @CAPS14. So when we were waiting we did a lot of things! First we went to ear in the food court! We delceced to go to chile's. we also had to wait for our food! Got some good hach's & they were very good! Then we went to the @CAPS6 @CAPS7! At the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I got @NUM1 key chains for my friends! Then I got myself @NUM2 magizens & a reading @CAPS10! I also get some @CAPS11 @CAPS12! They were very good! Next we just took a little walk around the @CAPS13! Then we went and sat down & relaxed for couple @CAPS14. Then I fell asleep! when woke up we were just about @CAPS15 to board! I was very @CAPS16 to finally get to @LOCATION1 & enjoy all of the @CAPS17 weather! I learned that being patient really does matter! That was the Time I was really patient"
19, "Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three step to being patient, being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient"
19, "It was my first game. I was pumped ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you re going in. Ther the assistant said no I wasn’t aloud to. The whole time I didn’t complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn’t complain and make it worth for everyone else. The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn’t mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way no. But at least I learned something."
23, "One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasn’t done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn’t. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long."
17, "The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom don’t have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you don’t have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!"
17, "Oneday at school @PERSON2 was waiting in line to get his lunch when out of the blue @NUM1 kids poped right infront of him. @PERSON1 said to the kid they you know you have to go to the back of the line right. “@CAPS1 we don’t. Said the kid. Then a few minst later a girl named @PERSON4 (that @PERSON2  likes) was going to the way backof the line but @PERSON2 said she could cut in front of him. So she did. Once @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 got up to were they got there  food and they were waiting to pay for it, when the kid @NUM2 spots away from @PERSON4 couden’t remember his student @CAPS2 number to figuer out that he was a new student.

Fianlly they got through @PERSON4 sat down with had friends but @PERSON3 had @CAPS1 where to sit because his friends were outside. So @PERSON4 seen him and asked if he wanted to sit with her so he did. Fially he was done @PERSON4 asked if @PERSON1 wanted to hang out at recess and he said sure, but one of @CAPS3 friends was not done eating so they had to wait for her. When she was done the went outside this was done the went outside this was what @PERSON1 was waiting for the bell rang to go inside. He was mad but he got to hang out with @PERSON4 the whole time."
24, "Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friends birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on @CAPS5 head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @CAPS2! The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I signed and slouched down on a picnik table. I knew now I would @CAPS7 to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slamed down on the root and thunder cracked."" @CAPS1 would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?"" I through. @CAPS2! @CAPS2! @CAPS2! More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we hear a @CAPS2! From far north frustrated I say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of @CAPS5 life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jersys splattered. With mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the ""@CAPS6 up"" look and I quickly ran to the car."" I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I @CAPS7 to change in the car."" I said to @CAPS5 self. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, ""@CAPS7 fun at your party @PERSON1, and @CAPS8 for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied ""@CAPS8 coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to @CAPS7. Many people appricite it when you are understaning and don't complian during difficult times."

18, "I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didn’t I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patients."
23, "“@CAPS1 on”. Said my little brother. @CAPS2 line is tacking forever. “@CAPS2 is the last time we are coming on @CAPS2 ride”. The ride that we were on was space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1 land in @LOCATION1. As we got into line at the ride there was a sighn I have and @NUM1 min wate from @CAPS2 point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking smil. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in @NUM2 weather. I was being as patience as I could be I just stood in line wish, hoping to pay self we could get on the oder. The first hour went by and another sighn came up @NUM3 hour from @CAPS2 point. We all got mad. The walk way sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop or someone’s?? hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally we wated @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 ride. That was the first time I was that patient."
17, A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didn’t understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I’ve ever ???
20, "This past @DATE1, my family and I went to @CAPS1. When were in flagstaff we were going to the??? It was basicly a big ski slope.

I was happy the next day. When we went to the @ORGANIZATION1."
14, "Sometimes its hard to be patient, especilly when you have to be tolerant to little kids. Well I have to do that sometimes, when I go to visit my little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and get on my nervers. She asks dumb questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends,"" @CAPS1, right, I don't think so. When ever I visit her I just have to tolerant her and be patient. For now I have to deal with her, but when we grow up we might become  friends, but maybe not."

My, @CAPS2 was ready to serve up ice cream  @CAPS4 of a sudden, my brothers and sisters started yelling, I 'm going first, I'm  going first! Lathan ?, my @CAPS2 asked? I responded by saying, I 'm not being a part of this! I thoyah you @CAPS6 how long is this going to go on since this was @CAPS4 getting mea  little freaky, I sad, @CAPS7! Get in line! They were like ok. So, patich tly, every one art  in the line and took their lurh choosing what kind of ice cream they wamted. And what a choice we had vanilla, strawberry, mint, of cookie dough ice cream. Ever one settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone."
16, "Patience, can you be patient? Some people are and some are and some  are not. Some time  I can not. Well hear is a story about patience. One time at school in the lunch line, it was long. It would bearl  move. I wanted lunch so bad I was not being patient. But for some resson my friend was being patient. I said to her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to  get something to eat. I said yeah that is true. So I tryed to be patient and before I know it I was siting by my friends  talking and eating my food."
12, "I was so bored â€œI was so bored but I know it would pay iof. I was on a flit to??? and it took/heavers. In that I hoven I went to the bathroom, eat lunch, plaed with my more sellfon, I sleped and then soller then I @CAPS1?? it we when there so ??? ??? ???."
20, A day of dreadful patience “can we leave now @CAPS1. I’m so bored I complained.” I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. “That’s it I’m gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don’t touch anything.” @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. That’s when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was holler’s and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don’t have is patience.
16, I’m going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.
22, "I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my @NUM1 @CAPS2. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten soit was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running @CAPS4 it and “@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 it. The party started at @NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped @CAPS4 asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn’t wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and curds. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents."
22, I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between @CAPS2 and @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. @CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
8, A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want.
21, "Patience. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS4 stomach rumbled."" @CAPS2 I'm hungry"" I cried so @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2, because @CAPS8 were on our way home. Moments later @CAPS8 finally pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2's drive through. The cashier said ""hi @MONTH1 I take your @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 yelled ""@CAPS5 I get a famous bowl and a @NUM1 piece honey @CAPS6 wings."" The ladie @CAPS7 ""@MONEY2 @NUM2 first window."" @CAPS8 drove around to the first window @CAPS4 @CAPS2 save the ladie a @MONEY1 bill, @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and said ""@MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window."" @CAPS9 @CAPS8 could drive to the second window @CAPS8 had to wait on the car ahead of us. @CAPS8 sat there for @MONEY1 minutes and they finally left. Then, @CAPS8 drove to the second window and waited. @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 still was waiting. So after @MONEY1 minutes. I said"" @CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1"" @CAPS12 calmly @CAPS7 ""@CAPS10, @CAPS8 are going to sit here patiencely."" I mumerred ""but I m starving."" @CAPS8 sat there and waited patientley for over a hour. I ask one more time ""@CAPS5 @CAPS8 leave please."" @CAPS12 said ""@CAPS10, I payed for the food and I'm going to get it."" @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 finally got the food after two hours. After sitting there @CAPS8 got some free food. Even though @CAPS8 got some free food I well still mad that @CAPS8 sat there all that time."
16, A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyer’s. So in all the game’s I always had to wait to the @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1’s. I was happy but I still wasn’t starting. then we got into the play off’s I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamate’s came up to me and said don’t worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few month’s I waited patiently. Then we got in tournament’s then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoff’s then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.
18, "One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirpping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked hardly anybody was there but @CAPS2 went to a store called???, it was so full of people  I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited.  Finally @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the casher said “@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient."

So we just get in the line and sign, it was at least @NUM4 something degrees. we waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front, we got into the chair and a bar came over us, I remember one thing set a quarter on  your leg and gravity takes a hold of it .

We found the ride but we first looked at the line it was huge. It shaked almost around the whole ride twice, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found our cover selves under a tent they put up so it was some what cool in line. So we waited a longer and longer till my brother started to flip out yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait here any longer” @CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour when finnaly, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here so l decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When l got on they still weren’t there, well the ride took off and they weren’t the best ride ever with me."

11, "I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient."

And when  we do we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and over or even through the river. But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back its more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn’t!)

As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself.  like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult Iâ€™ll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say Iâ€™m getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when Iâ€™m an grown adult Iâ€™ll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad."
19, "One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said “yes”. So I went and packed some things to take because they don’t have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said “I don’t know” of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didn’t listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didn’t work because she didn’t talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didn’t reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don’t know why she didn’t talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient."
15, "Patience is when your waiting .I was patience when in line waiting for lunch .I didn’t c ut any one to eat .I was standing and waiting for my turn .Patience ,some people don’t have it .Lots of people just cut or yell at you because they don’t have  any patience. Sometimes people will push you out of their way .They only do that because they don’t have patience at all. Patience is what people need .People need patience because lots o f feelings get hurt .Everyone should have patience."
13, "I am not a patience person, like I can’t sit in a sit for more than five minutes, but there was one time I was patience and i bet very alse was to that right riding a bike where out training wheels. When I was five learned how to ride a bike I just keeped falling of at one piont my bike  flip and I allmost broke my jaw but i didn’t. Finally after @NUM1 weeks of onstint falling I rode for @NUM2 minutes without falling and finally learn how to riken a bike."
13, "It can be very hard for somebody to be patient. If you are patient, then you are understanding and tolerant. You have to be patient sometimes. When you go to the dentist or doctor’s office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She hated the dentist. It was always so boring. First, you‘d sit there while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like @NUM1 minutes before you even go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then you’d sit there for another fifteen minutes. Finally, When you are done getting your teeth cleaned you’d sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist. So, you need to be patient sometimes, even when you are just dying of boredome."
18, "A time when I was patient was when I preordered a videogame called @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I preordered it a month before it came out and I couldn’t wait for it to come out. I mostly wanted it because @ORGANIZATION1 is the company that makes it and this is the last game @ORGANIZATION1 was making because some other company bought the @CAPS1 series from @ORGANIZATION1. When the game finally came out on @DATE1 fourteenth two thousand ten, I bought with my friends and the game is amazing. I would give it four of five stars. I’m not absessed with it through. I play it only about two hours a day which is all my parensts let me play any way. Hala @CAPS2 is my very favorite game."
12, "This is about a story I was patient I was on an @LOCATION1 “@LOCATION1, so this is what happen on the @LOCATION1. I was standing in line on ordered some sausages, eggs, pancakes atia syrup, has browns and orange jucie and take my cool derille sitting a man with a steak for his head and order something and sits down, and I get mad a little the I’m still patient okay but then I’m really mad because geating steak head get’s his before mine and walked in here first.

Finally, the girl and I finally get a food and show the old people hip is we challenged them to surf contest but the main in to sit and wait and be patient even through it @NUM1 in the @TIME1."
21, "One day, a few years ago, I woke up and my mom said we were going  to my grandma’s house. So started to get ready. After I was done getting dressed I looked on.  My dresser and grabbed my @MONEY2 @MONEY3 that I was saving up to buy something just incase we went to the store When we got there I saw my cousin’s dad @CAPS1 walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog, he said it was his brothers dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog so I asked him how much did he coast. @CAPS1 said @MONEY1. I got really excited because I had @MONEY2 and could get @MONEY3 from my granding. So I called my mom but she was busy somewhere else but she told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So @CAPS1 waited their for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatience and bought him. But my wow wasn’t mad because she ended up liking him"
17, "Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a @PERSON1 @CAPS1. He played in a @CAPS11 called @CAPS2 which l really wanted to @CAPS10. Which came out @DATE1. That l havent even seen yet until One day l was sitting in my porch where l asked my mom to @CAPS19 to @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS2 that @DATE2 when she said ""wlc"" l was really upset because l wanted to @CAPS10 it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to fave me. @CAPS14 they said they were busy so l cried myself to sleep. The next @NUM1 days my mom and dad was talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling ""@CAPS6 ARE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 AND @CAPS10 A @CAPS11 AND @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS7 @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS9 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 OWN @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 I left out the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 it knowing l wanted to @CAPS9. They came home reasing me saying @CAPS6 good the @CAPS11 was.

16, "I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for instance, I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It’s just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1 I told him I didn’t do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldn’t be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn’t force them to or anything but I’m not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if I’m “patient,” I’m sure I will be able to do it!"
11, Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient many times. For instance when my mom uses the phone late till she gets of to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies you have to be patient until the movie are play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one the mean patience is very important. If you dont have patience to some people that is anrcoying. If i didnt have patience I would be a completely???person people would mind me very amount and every they would @CAPS1 get along with me so inside of bothering someone @CAPS2-stop be patient.
20, "One time I went in the @CAPS1 and I had to sit in the visiting room/ area for about @NUM1 min- @NUM2 mins. I really didn’t care, because I had to go to school after I was done you could tell any me in was not very happy because your only sapose to be waiting for @NUM3 minutes. I finally got in and went to sit in the chair and they took my rubber bands off and I had to sit there and wait for about @NUM4 minutes. I was still being patient, because I didn’t want to go to school. I don’t like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you. The doctor finaly came to check on me then I got different color rubber bands on. Also the doctor  came to see me and see if my bracese were all right. I finaly got out of the @CAPS1 oficce and it was about @NUM5 so I got to go home and I was happy."
19, "One @DATE1 week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1’s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1’s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldn’t do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 you’re bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me. She wasn’t getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient. My @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster."
12, Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.
20, "It had been about one??? after I got my ipod touch and I really wanted to get this certain??? no it was a movie. The movie was I @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had already seen it once from my cousins ipod but it was so cool, I had to watch it again. It had so much action in it. And zombies??? attack. Multiple words @CAPS3"

DING @CAPS4! The door bell rang and I sprinted to the door. “@CAPS5!” “@CAPS6!” @CAPS5 exclaimed. “@CAPS8 you guys need to go wait in the garage for @CAPS18 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 said. “@CAPS11!” we said in harmony. We out the door and @CAPS3 was pitch dark. “I cant see, hold me!” I screamed in terror. All we saw was head lights and we knew @CAPS3 was @CAPS2 @CAPS18 @CAPS9. “Are you guys ready its almost @CAPS13 @CAPS14 and we gotta leave or we want make @CAPS3 to @CAPS15 @CAPS16!” @CAPS2 @CAPS18 @CAPS9 was excited. Just hearing that word, @CAPS15 @CAPS21 was the @CAPS22 to getting there @CAPS23 thing was great but at @CAPS15 @CAPS16 You gotta have a lot of @CAPS21."
19, "One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to @LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or music player. It fit live it would never spend, @CAPS2 I didn't complane.I sat in the seat for what felt like forever. Then when we got off the train I said ""@CAPS1.

Next the trained agin. @CAPS2 this time I had a top by that got boring so I still didn't complain. @CAPS2 dad said it has to long and I would be able to bring my os next time. That is my example of pacience."
12, "I want to say I found her, tex right away but I did’nt. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together. But love is, love is patient if you rtun to it it probably won’t stay with you but if wait and are patient maybe, just maybe it’ll come to you. I just have make sure I’m somewhere she can find me”. said church. @NUM1 year later. “@CAPS3 what’s thhhiiis.” @CAPS4 said “I know what this is” can I just shut the door for the night?” @CAPS5 @PERSON1. “ @CAPS6, Patience @PERSON1 were waiting for @CAPS7.”  @CAPS8 replied. “ @CAPS3 here he comes now” @CAPS10, @CAPS10.” @CAPS11 what I found I church. “@CAPS6” @CAPS4 you found the @CAPS1. Capture wait he’s in.” “do you think we have to wait for it to unlock.” When will it do that unlocky openy thing. I don’t know we will have to wait and see. That is if it will open."
24, "@PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. "@CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier," said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. "@CAPS2!" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. "@CAPS3 happened?" "I tried my back flip."  "I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!"  "@CAPS4â€¦" "I'll go get an ice pack." @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, @CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do."
9, I am patent i always have to wait for somthing or earn it. I go to my grouping with my parents but I have to wat. I have to wait to go to my aunts. The worst time to wat is going to @CAPS1/a up @LOCATION1 and camping.
9, "One time I was patient for the doctors and I had a great time. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentest. My therd time I was patient when I was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and it was boring waiting but I was patient. Last but not least I was patient to go on the tower of terror. It was the funest ride there."
22, "I sat there, staring off into the distance waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back to my chair and propped my head toward the ceiling. I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paint’s @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. “@CAPS1 is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently. “@CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3.”  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned to be patient with all sorts of things."
11, "Being patience is hard to do, @CAPS1 I do remember a time when I was patient. This was at @CITY1. Me and my group had to wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first one’s to the bus so it took a while before they came. @CAPS1 before they did I was as calm and patient as can be."
7, "Patient is very hard when your waiting for something you want. Very hard when your waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If your not a patient person that cant wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while then your a very impatient person that cant wait. If you are a impatient person then you are selfish, mad, and evidently not patient."
17, "When I was at the mall one time with @PERSON1 we whent to flee and bought malching hats and skirts. Then we went to the chineze stand and there was a bag like ???. We wated for like a half and hour to get other food. We wated patiently and we got other food and we sat down at a table and that was the last table. Then a family of for was loocking for a seat and @CAPS1 we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the movies and we waited in line and @PERSON1 was being impatient @CAPS1 we had him save our spot. Then I took @PERSON1 across the walk way and got @PERSON1 a show thick. Now @PERSON1 was upto pay @CAPS1 we walked back to the movie theater and we bought @NUM1 bags of  popcorn, and then we paenently wated in line to get our seats. That is one of my stories of being pachent with my friends."
14, "Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 experience one of the most boreing @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definetly requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you. I have to admit, I don’t have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quite you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of it’s an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient."
21, "There once was a soldier named @CAPS7 connor. He is a private first class. His bestfriend named @PERSON1, he was also a private.” I can’t believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy.” @CAPS1 @CAPS7. “@CAPS2 thats how its like man,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1. They both @CAPS1 walking to the firing range. Ping! Went the target as the bullet struck it. “@CAPS3 shot!,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1. “@CAPS5.” @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Right in the center was the hole were the bullet struck. @CAPS7 had great aim but he still had to wait. “Patience,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1. @CAPS7 was patient and all but he wanted to go so bad. Finally his time came deployment. He  was so excited to go. One day on patrol his convoy was hit hard by mortors, he was killed in an instanct. In this story patience is the key to everything remember about patience next time you have to wait."
18, "One time when my family went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, we had to wait in line for the one roller causter I sayed witch one it was. Well I wasn’t as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @CAPS2.  She had just gotten her @CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I can’t spend a day without using or just looking at my @CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever."
11, Patience perso is someone that deal with difficulties without complaining. Like when your waiting in the docters office fora checkup. Or in the eye doctors maybe a dentist. When your in the doctors office it all quiet then there a phone ringing! Then the doctor walks in or dentist all there is is waiting and waiting.
15, "Last @DATE1 I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And we drove for hours! O my go she butt hort! We got there and there were no packing spots, so we went to the back back lot! but then I was excited we were walking towards the park I was the wicked twister and surprised my @CAPS3 asked me to pick the first ride I said the wicked twister so we got in and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what it took @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there was like @NUM2 more people! So that day I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole @NUM3 pound burgers fries and a shake! So theres my story about my patience!"
16, When I was in third grade I hoped one of my friends who had some disabilities but I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dedating with someone like him patience plays a great part in friend ship with him. Ever though he had his days I would say to my self ''you have him and have patience '' and to this day him and I are still friends.
11, "Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it’s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren’t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2."
16, "This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn’t liking the @CAPS1 than she said “she was scared” of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival, came I was exsited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the on therides,so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went oh a few she wasn’t scared as much. Than wall, we were walking she saw a ride, one of the bigest rides there, she said we should go on that so than I told her if she wonted to I we could go on it, and she was sure, after that ride we kept going on differnt bigger rides, wall we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary that was the time I had patience for a friend."
17, "There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person."
16, "When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off."
13, One time I went to cetar point and I was rideing in the car. And we were about @NUM1 hour away from the cetar point park. And I was talking with my sister @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and I fell asleep. And the we were there I was so excited and that I couldn’t wait to go on the @CAPS1. And I was walking in the park with sisters mom& dad into the park and all I could hear was people scream on the rollercoaster and the we were in line for the @CAPS1 and I was in the back of the line and I was to unpatience and I was like in my mind com’on com’on and I was in like feeling like I didn’t want to on it anymore and I was time to ride the @CAPS1 and I went on it and I was off the ride in matters of @NUM2 sec. and that was my story of patiences.
17, "Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you don’t care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they weren’t. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didn’t have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, “it starts at @TIME1. So I have to leave”. She kept asking me why I didn’t call and I kept telling her I didn’t have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I can’t go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient."
12, I was patient when I had to witch @NUM1 little bad girls at my sisters house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the @TIME1. I did then her god kids came over. That @TIME1 sister rembend she had to go some were. So that morning she left me with the kids for @NUM2 hours. So I had to wait patiently for her to come back. Finaly she did.
21, "When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were gooing  to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so exited and very impatient I couldn’t wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten say they are gonning to be here in @NUM1 but they were never their. Soon i realized it was about @NUM2 p.m and knew i wouldn’t see them untill tomorrow and i will be patient so i don’t waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good nights rest i got up are breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk!Honk! could it really be no it couldn’t it was uncle @CAPS3 and his big motorcycle. A few hours later i heard @PERSON1 again and said uncle @CAPS3 is probably leaving but then i herd my cousins @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked  the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key."
9, "Patience is a very long task @CAPS2 the rewards out weigh the time you waited for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up to a line to a rollar coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However many people are not very patient. (@CAPS1 me) @CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be @CAPS1 a trile and lots of patience."
8, A time I was pacent was I was wating in line for lunch. I was pacent becou’s thair where lot’s of other people in line and people where letting other people cut tham so the line was getting longer. That is the story of one of the times I was pacent.
13, "One time I was patient??? was my dad was going to sent me a @CAPS1 present. I was just waiting and waiting for it.

That was the time I was patint"
16, "Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness. For an example I was walking and @CAPS1 this guy walked up. To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasn’t very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said “do you know to shut up”! badly he said “yes” @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said “sorry”.! And for some reason he said “got you” I said “what” I was so mad but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don`t know who watching, literally."
8, When I was patien we had to wait in a line for a @CAPS1 coster I was scared of some kids in line were unpaitent and wanted to get on the @CAPS2 fast I was patient and waited util  we got on I was verry scared when I were on When I got off I had a smile on  my face I was glad I was patient
16, "A time I was patient when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 of @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 grandma @CAPS1, grandpa @PERSON1, and @CAPS4 brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictured of people. I said “grandma @CAPS1 can’t we do that please.”@CAPS3 said “yes.” @CAPS4 brother got to got first. I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed. I was next I sat on the seat the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit their but I was patient. I didn’t say a word just sat their and smiled. A picture that took about @NUM1 to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture laughed and smiled I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. A time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1."
17, "A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience.  My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, “@CAPS1 @CAPS2!” as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!"
18, "Write in your own say about patience. @PERSON2 and his mom are on their way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @PERSON2 been waiting his whole life to go there. Bill’s mom gets a call from cousins, @PERSON3, bob and @PERSON1, his cousins ask can they go? @PERSON2’s mom say sure. @PERSON2 is patient boy so he just lets it go. Still patient. Once @PERSON2’s mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five friends. They all ask the same question his cousins ask. His mom says yes.They each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. Finaly there. @PERSON2 is so mad but is still patient.When his mom gets another call @PERSON2 says who is it now !?! Its his dad calling to say. I’m at the @CAPS3 with @PERSON2’s brother and sister, where are you? @PERSON2’s mom responded, I palling in now @CAPS4 is my story about patients."

19, "Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. “I’m sorry but @PERSON1 won’t be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that you’d like to do your @CAPS1?’ A perplexed expression spread across my face. “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?” I asked. “yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o’clock. “she suggested. “that’s fine.”  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didn’t get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has it’s advantages."
14, "One day on my way to school I went to pick up my friend he told me that he had this new game called call of duty world at war he just kept on talking about it and what he dose online then last class of the day he sat by me and said I cant wait to go home and play my new game then I said cool then he said start complaining but I have to wait one more hour. I told him just be patient and wait then he said your right it’s not like it’s going anywhere I can play it anytime then he told me wana come over and play then we both went to his house and prayed the game, I told his remember to always be patent till the time is here."
15, "Time when I was patient was at the doctor appointment I was standing there, calm quiet. When the doctor called, me I wasn’t nervous. So when the doctor gave me @NUM1 which, @CAPS1 didn’t have at. Then, me and my mom went home happy. Got some hwigese  and watch @CAPS2. Then , we had some spaghetti and went to had early for school. Then, I had a good day in school in the @NUM2 grade when I was in land.  Then, I went home, do my homework, clean up the house, watch. @CAPS2, eat dinner, then went to led has a early start"
19, "A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday. I kept waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to come. I was dissapointed, because the shipped it from @LOCATION1 and it doesn’t take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn’t happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom go ahed to ask when they’re going to send it and the lady said, “it’s on the way.” A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It was worth the wait."
16, "One of my storys of being patient is this one time was at my uncles nonse and I wanted to play the tboy @NUM1. Well the was like five other kids to and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited like for a hour or two atleast it felt like it and I didn’t say a word about it the whole time, then I finally got to play. That’s my story about being patient."
17, "@NUM1 years ago our immigration limit had ran out. We needed green cards to become @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So we went to an immigration center in deproit. We walked up to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go sit it in the waiting erea. There was about @NUM2 people there! I knew we were going to be here a while that point forward. We went to the waiting erea. I had no way of amusing myself. It stricktley said in the front, no gaming devices, no musical devices. All phones must be switched off. It was tourcher. After about an hour and a half they called our name. I was so pleased. After we got our finger prints and everything completed and we walked out to the car, my mom said she was very pleased of the way I behaved in that office."
8, My mom patient because I use her phone a lot to text and to my girlfriend and to text and call friends she tells me when i get a text or a call when she needs to use it.
20, "A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my present’s there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the day’s got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didn’t even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didn’t get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and app’s and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. That’s why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision that’s the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but it’s some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..I’m happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. That’s why??? can play it because I’m saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one."
17, "The first time I baby sat was with @NUM1 little girls. A toddler named @PERSON1 and a baby named @CAPS1. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, @CAPS4 @CAPS1 started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, “@CAPS3, @CAPS3!” @CAPS4 I realized she was saying, “@CAPS5, @CAPS5!”. Her @CAPS5 is a blanket and when I handed it to her, she stopped immeadiently! Now I realize how patient I was with her. I’m glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time I’ll be just as patient."
15, Patience is a special skill for some people and some its very hard. When I was a little girl I was never had any patience and even now. I do not have any either but my friend was always patient for me yah she would tell me to hurry up or lll leave but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and jekc it to the pound that’s what she would always do to. Patience I will probebly never lean till @CAPS1 like older but I know I will learn it someday. One time my friend waited for @NUM1 hours just to learn about history I would have never learned that my but then again she did get ??? ???? on her @CAPS2 homework. so her patience for that was like really cool and she told me that patience is a number one priority. his was one time my friend had patience.
18, One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race. I had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there on I didn`t want to get last. An I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. Second- we finally got our seats an I had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. The jets went over us and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1). The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. It was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient.
13, "A time that I was patient is when I had my twelth birthday. All of my friends exept one, wanted to keep playing. So we did. We desited to go and walk the dogs, and then have dinner, and then open presints. When we were all done with that, we opend my presints, I was very excited to see them. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Pluss in the end, I got a lot of exiting stuff and I relized that wating, and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. I’m pretty schure that we all had a great time."
18, "Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn’t be able to wait that long."
15, "When I was about @NUM1 I wanted one thing in the wold. You know how some girl would want a baby ball no not me I wan’t a rex this toy was the bigest and the meanest dinow on the plant well when I was a little it was. It was so cool to me ti could walk, talk it can run he can bit. Ever time I go to the story I would go to the toy part of the story, and find that rex and look at it in the eyes in say “you will be mine one day.” You know how relly wan’t somthing and mom says chismist is coming up. When it an’t comeing in till @NUM2 months. But I won’t it now not in @NUM2 months. So I thought what can I do to get the rex befor @NUM2 months? I got it!I will clen up more, walk the bog more, do better in school, and hopefully that will work. So I ask my mom “mom if I start doing all this good stof can I get so of my chismast thing in a week @NUM5” she said “no you just get more thing on chismis” I was so mad I was about to cry. But @NUM2 month was not that long.  I was opening my gifts in no time. but I thought that I open all my gifts, I look arond one good time I did! But I don’t see the rex I was said even thow I had like @NUM7 or more gifts. I still don’t have that rex. So I sidely walk to my room. My mom came in my room with a big box.  Could it be! I jumped out of my bed so fast my mono don’t see me. I looked in the box it was  a lot of babys doll. Then she said go down stars and ther he was rex looking so happy to see me."
21, "“@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!” my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didn’t even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didn’t get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldn’t believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced “@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team” then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasn’t so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait."
16, "On my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought along my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 to keep me busy, I brought my @CAPS1 along because it would be annoying if I ask are we there yet?” very @NUM1 minutes, and I knew that a @NUM2 hr drive would need some intertament. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast, if I don’t play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cusihs, @PERSON1, and sleep. After awhile of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hrs."
23, "One time I was patient. It was dec @NUM1 @DATE1 @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1. On @CAPS1 eve morning I slept till @NUM2 I wanted to?? To come. I was patient so I played video games not thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store I seen all the @CAPS1 things. I felt like I could’t wait no longer. That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it would’t be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy I waited."
19, A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. “@CAPS1’s gonna be a long ride” I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn’t nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.
7, "Patient is when your are understanding and tolerant. Many parts of life are achieved with patience, because some things are worth waiting for @CAPS1 is alaways a time and a place for everything, and getting there is achieved with the great virtue patience."

14, "It was @DATE1 when   my family and I went to cedar point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip was about three or six hours long. I went to sleep but when I wake up we was at burger king.  I ordered we a kids meal and it was good. so  as  we  got  back  in the  car I stayed up the  rest  of  the way there.  Then I start seeing water parks and hotels it was really nice. Then I seen this really tall roller coaster   I got really excited that I ran to the line, bed they were all long. I had a wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my tom in like  I was so  happy and  excited   that  when I got  my   stamp  I ran  to the @CAPS1-@CAPS2  in  door  roller  coaster. So I had to  wait  an hour  in line , so I got  really tired, but I kept mouing  forward, when I reached the  stairs  finally I got  on the  ride. I was binda scared at the sometime because it was dark. then  we  took off then it  got  off I was  dissy, but I went  on another  ride  and  got  disser. I got on this ride that rocks side to side. His is the time I was patient."
14, "Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don’t also ??? Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get in the bus stop @NUM1 min early, so I can talk with my mother ??? Try I got up to early. I made it to the bus stop early. ??? @NUM2 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patient. On day I was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about @NUM3 peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had later. I was there people payed from cash regester. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient."
20, "In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick, @CAPS1 I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad “can I go to the doctor because I feel sick?”??? @CAPS1 he said “we will leave @NUM1 am” and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didn’t. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dad’s favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said “Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.” @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself “I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.”"
18, "On my last trip at @CAPS1 point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for @NUM1 hours on the mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because… the mister fans were having tecinal diffucatties . And how can I be patient when it is @NUM2 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was @NUM3 way I kept my patience."" I told my self, ""and in no time you will be there."" @CAPS2 I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like @NUM4 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after @NUM5 hours in line the mist fans @DATE1 to lift. Patience can bring luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but accaully was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was releaved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success."
17, "One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor’s appointment and over slept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctor’s appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed in the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed   it was grilling later so he didn’t get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a part of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctors went inside and saw there were millions of people in the waiting  room, he went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired   of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @PERSON1 kept his self busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn’t realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check-ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called   in @LOCATION1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put @NUM1, maybe @NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into his the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep."
8, Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait or there’s a really long wait or line. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That’s what patients mean to me in my own way.
8, "I am a very patient person. An example are games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or months. For others you might have to wait years. I have done this before."
24, "I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I’m sorry. Thanks for your cooperation” click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It’s time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!” That was my story of being patient."
20, "Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept giving me updates, to calm me, to no avail. So I @CAPS1 out a smoke to ease my nerves. I didn’t know if my wife, or our baby would live. Would it live happy? I just @CAPS1 a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying. I rushed over to my wife’s room, to find her holding a beutiful baby girl. “@CAPS1 you long enough”"
21, "We were driving to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. I was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. We got all packed up and we were onthe road. It was about an hour in I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and @DATE1 and I woke up. After we got back me and my bother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there @DATE1 it was great. Their house was up in a mountain, I had fan visiting them and we walked around town went into stores.  I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient."
20, "Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. You’re annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. “patient is everything,” one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didn’t blame him, wich all those choices, he didn’t know what to pick, the lost of the line wasn’t as patient, “harry up.” One said “come on.” @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasn’t really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed"
10, "Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not your normal. @CAPS1-@CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help  you in the long run. I f you and I were patient our would would be a  little  bit fasier. Like  if your brother for an instint was in your bathroom and you had  to use it. you  could wait for him to finish. That is saving  argueing and it’s  being patient. I say these thing like “I’m patient!” but that would be  a lie, because I am far from it! Not saying it’s  easy but we all try."
20, "One day comes home??? movie we were stopped @CAPS1 I train  one train .

16, One day at the fair I was patient. I wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There where about @NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I waited in line until it was my turn. They let @NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people got in front of us. Then after @NUM3 minutes it was our turn we picked our car and had some fun. That's a time when I was patient.
14, One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying ‘’do we really have to go’’ of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said ‘’lets go in the waiting room’’. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient.
9, "Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans.  Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn’t pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine."
17, "I @DATE1, my family took a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. After @CAPS3 got to the airport @CAPS3 had to wait a long time. So  there @CAPS3 are on the airport, about to leave to go to @LOCATION1 when are flight is delayed because a early morning thunderstorm rolled in. @CAPS6 took forever, every minute seemed like an hour, @CAPS1 after  half an hour I asked for some money to get some breakfast but of course my mom said, “@CAPS2.” I was about to lose @CAPS6 when this guy came over the speaker, “@CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little longer.” @CAPS4 when I rember that I have a @CAPS5 in my bag and I go to turn @CAPS6 on and @CAPS6’s dead. Then after an hour the storm stopped and @CAPS3 were able to board the plane. From that day I found out I’m not a pacient person."
11, "Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was patien when I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. When I whent to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I had to wait in line. I didn’t have to wait for that long but I had for wait , I didn’t like it, but I was patein. It was worth the wait. I had to wait in line for food to there was a lot of people in line there. That was worth the wait too. There food was good. That is how I use my lifeskill of patience. Patience is a good life skill to practice."
12, "Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well I’m going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking. @PERSON1 is a very patience person."
20, "Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn’t have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1!!!. I wasn’t vary patient then but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office thingy, so I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paper work because she didn’t make me all appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1 if you add that up this @NUM2 @DATE1 waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient but my mom definitely wasn’t. So finally they called me in and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for @NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper/ physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7 and we didn’t get home until @NUM8!!!. That is a time I was patient."
9, "Once I was patient, I want to go they football with my dad but didn’t want to. So when he was puting shoe on when I would ask him to come play football he would take his shone off. Then I had to wait two and half hour just for him to get one shone on. When he was putting second shon I didn’t say anything so. We faihl when and play football.

14, "My dad is a very patient person. He’s known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. I’m proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is."
18, "The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didn’t get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didn’t. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that’s the time I was patient."
23, "A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them."
11, "Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life."
16, "Two years ago my dad had surgery on his because he broke it at work .I had to sit in a waiting  room  for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do .Every two hours my mom ,grandma ,grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch .After about four hours I got really  tired ,but didn’t fall asleep .That was the longest I’ve sat in one place my entire life .At first it was hard to believe it was nine hours and a half it only seemed like two ."
11, "I am patient in a lot of stof, when I play I am patient. When I take a test I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there not patient. They just want to take the ball and score. One time I was playing at the park with my friends I was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day."
16, "Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you’re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you’re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren’t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you’ve lost, and you’ve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I’ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I’m trying to say is that when you’re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn’t a “bundle of roses” all the time, so soon or later, you’re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn’t human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I’m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently."
21, "Do you ever fell like your @CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. The story starts at @TIME1pm my brother @LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @PERSON2, and my friend @LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped @PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get @LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already @NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store @LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""@CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as @PERSON2 pushed the @PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my @CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again."
7, In some point you have to be patient. If you are in a line need to be patient. you have to be patient to waiting for a share to part. You have to be patient if something is coming in the mid and you can as wait to what is or you no what it is and you just can’t ran to get it. When you go to the store and you see some thing you want and have mom or dad say they will git you for your brithbay then you can no wait for you bathbay then you can no wait for you birthday.Well I have been there . I love crismase because you got almose everything you want; When something you to do something you have been wanting forever you are going there for the first time. All of these thing you have to be patient.
21, "Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years."
17, "At time when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 I woke up and I told my dad that I wanted to go to my favorite store. @CAPS1 my dad said “lets go.” @CAPS1 we went to the store and it said that it was closed. @CAPS1 I check the hours and they were going to open in @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 my dad and me being patients. Well mostly my dad because he did not say “let’s go” or anything. @CAPS1 @NUM2 mntues past and we had @NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally @NUM3 minutes past and it was time, but the people that worked there said to wait about @NUM3 minutes cause they had to set up things. @CAPS1 my dad like always nice. He waited @NUM3 more minutes, @CAPS1 we could go in. Now finally @NUM3 minutes past and we got to go inside and I was @CAPS1 happy. Being patient is the best thing ever. No complaining or nothing."
16, "Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patience because my little cousin who live in @LOCATION1 had a pisered   since birth. It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.  So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patience and she will @CAPS1."
17, "Just be patient lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? Awile. I will be done fileing papers in about an hour then I will take you to the park an hour? that is such a long time. Just go watch tv. but I dont want to leave me alone or when I get done I wont take you to the park ok. So @CAPS1 whent and placed vidow games with his little sister @PERSON1 for awhile, and made some pizza, and then his friend from school come over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his and his mom. So he asked lucie if he could go to the park with ryan and she said yes just be back by five o’clock. and he and @PERSON1 had a great time. and ryans mom got them all ice cream. and he learned that being patient is very very important."
18, "One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were some were in my room so I looked every were. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them but my dad was still patient: I deystroyed my room looking for his keys, they were not in my dresser, closset, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car and now the keys are gone then when I went to tell my dad who was being so patient for a hour I fond them in my pocket."
18, "A time that I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink @ORGANIZATION1 shoes. My dad in @LOCATION1 said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandmas house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I ididnt want to buy my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After @NUM2 more week I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn’t come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was estatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience payed off."
20, "My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn’t get it out and said that she would have to at in out, I had screamed. Tet, with patience, she was some how able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn’t sit still. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happen, she is patient about it."
16, A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentists on the to get a cavity filled. When we got there they said my appointment wasn’t for another a??? but my mom didn’t want to leave.

Hopeing my brother and sister was downstairs all ready waiting for me. Oh no! They weren't downstairs! Running back up stairs like the house is on fire, I went in my brother's room and yelled,"" @CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS4 already missed the bus. I don't want right to my sister room. Yelling the same thing, she quickly got out of bed and got dressed. Walking downstairs, thinking very thing is going to be fine. I got breakfast ready. Then my sisters come running down.

8, "A lot of people are patient and they wait because they don’t want to make someone mad or mess-up something that they are doing. People always be careful of what they are doing. I ever be patient sometimes and its not that hard to be patient it is pretty easy. Everyone absouletly knows that, those people are out their, they know, trust me. Theirs many different things that’ve been patient for, but I don’t know which one I choose to write, cause there is alot of them. “@CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @CAPS1 you can’t or can’t hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use other one, or @CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait for your turn, but @CAPS1 its been pass in an hour then tell that person to get off not to be mean, but you either need on and have your turn. There is no way you can’t be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. Not too hard. It’s pretty easy and everyone knows that too you know."
21, "Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was abnovius and always had to time it his way. @PERSON1 always waited his turn with something and shared. One day while watching @CAPS1.V. they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad they wanted it. His dad called the phone ??? and ???, I it ??? it world take @CAPS2 weeks. When @ORGANIZATION1 ??? it was @CAPS2 weeks he ??? fit. On the other hand @PERSON1 said @CAPS3 dad went to his ???. Pays would ??? and @ORGANIZATION1 would always @CAPS4 dad ???around because he couldn’@CAPS1 wait. @PERSON1 just took it like it was ??? day. @ORGANIZATION1 would sit by the ??? and watch the ??? the ??? with his locked. Eventually the day came. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and picked his rocket up ???. In that time @PERSON1 ??? out the door. When to the of them had the rockets ??? they opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 was disapointed because he wanted to play now but first he had to build it. @PERSON1 took his time doing step by step instructions and no time his rocket was done. @ORGANIZATION1 just cramed pieces together and came out crooked and broke. @ORGANIZATION1 yelled landly. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told he would help and in @NUM1 minutes they finished. Together they played and had fun. The end."
10, "I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. To me patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have."
8, Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is being understanding and tolerant. For example a kids mom left for work she takes @NUM1 hours and she come home. The kid said “that was quick.” That is what patience.
14, For me im not that patient canse if some one close something to me or any of my friends I will go off on them can see I don’t tolerat my frinds bing picked on by some one they don’t even know or I don’t know. Thers this one time me and my frinds were walking down the hall way at school.

19, "One time when I was patient was when my mom’s car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she can’t make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient."
23, "A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. “@CAPS1 what’s going on!” I yelped across the room “@CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer!” @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jublee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor and I wasn’t so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. “@CAPS4’s go try it out!” @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equiptment. After @NUM1 minutes I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. @CAPS3’s just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. “I saved this kitten’s life with my cure for cancer.” @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasn’t sure if she would live. “@CAPS6 give it to her?” the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. “@CAPS7, not yet.” I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldn’t talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, “@CAPS8 you”. I only smiled back."
19, "The time I needed patience. We were on the groccery store, @CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we first got there I was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to just eat it all. The cart was half way. ??? @CAPS7 we got more stuff and it was @CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “@CAPS2 me just get a couple one things.” @CAPS3 I waited, and waited @CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All of them were @CAPS3 long and I felt like I was ???(@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6) @CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldn’t take it, I was about to talk that little girl down. But I had to calm myself @CAPS3, @CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @CAPS3 happy. @CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked bacos and I was just ready to go to bed."
12, One day my mom said I could get this new toy at the store but my mom had to do other things before we went to the store so I had to be patient. My mom had to go to where she works because she forgot something. Then she had to go to the gas station. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy that I wanted.
16, "One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out my slurpee and inline to buy my slurpee. then an old lady got in line. So to be nice I let her in front of me. @CAPS1 a while she found out that she was a dollar short. So I gave her a dollar. She turned to me said thanks and gave me a mint @CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We sat their for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house my friend hold to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and on that day, I learned that it’s tough to be patient."
21, "I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasn’t fully paddy trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows .So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I don’t know  why it would try to move us but it did .We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years out to figure out that he wasn’t supposed to do that  but on (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dop to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient."
18, "My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said were going to potter park zoo.

18, "One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the I asked school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and the to @ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was down hill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! after an hour I got bored with my little brother with us didn’t help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we have to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @NUM1 hurs. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we will be delayed three more hours, after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours."
17, "Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it. Though the story @MONTH1 have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made coments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening."
17, "I v'e been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to go out my cat I said sure and went and got my jacket on. Mom said I got to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for like a minutes. When they finally got out dad asked ?????????Shouted @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He said ok and we went. when we  got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside there were like a billion people in there. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about @NUM1. I started to read a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went in those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't ever talk at all, and I talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient."
5, Patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already exsited. But some time you are doing like if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else that is patience
13, "I was at the @NUM1 fair with my friends. There was a ride called the freak-out that we really wanted to go on. The line was to long so we decided to go on some other rides. We looked over at the line and all it was doing was getting longer. We decided to go get in line anyway. It felt like we were moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes, I had to be very patient. On the inside I was ready to go nuts but I was calm on the outside it was the longest @NUM3 minutes ever!!!!"
16, "The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 was over @NUM1 hours long wait. Bad news for me become I am definintaly not a patience person. Like this one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There was only two people in line but I didn’t want to wait so I didn’t want one anymore. That’s how impatience I was, but riding the best ride in the world I was willing to wait. Two hours of waiting in line we seen a sign that said one hour from this @ORGANIZATION1. Very mad I kept saying to myself it’s the best ride you can wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds longer"
16, "A time when I was patient was when I was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 ,@LOCATION2 ,we were waiting in line for this water roller coaster and the line was really long and they had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour ,then go to this machine to get a eazy pass ticket but we decided to wait in the really, long line .So half an hour later went by and I started to get really board so I asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slapps .So we played for a little while went past and we were about half way there and we started regreting stay in the huge line because it had already been an hour so and we only move to the half way market .About ten minutes later I stopped playing slapps with my dad because my hands were beat red and his hands were barrely even red if that .So we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters  the way there .After about ten to twenty minutes later we were boarding the raft .We went through a cave then stopped like fourty  feet then splashed in to a huge amount of water .It turns out that wait was worth it .So that is a time when I showed patients.."
21, "One time when I was patient was when we were flying to @LOCATION1. We were in @LOCATION2 waiting. God I thought how long can this take. But evenaly the plane came. Once on I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a @NUM1 @NUM2 flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I-pod, a book, and the @CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed a hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decied I would read. But after an hour and – a – half I finished the book. Then my I-pod come out. I listened to music until lunch came a hour later. After eating lunch which took @NUM3 minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched @CAPS4 @CAPS5 which killed off enough @NUM4 hours. Then with only @NUM4 hours left I wanted to watch season @NUM6 of the office. Then when there was only @NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in @LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it."

19, "?? It was a normal old boring day in the @DATE1 but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to cedar point the next day. I was astonished! I didn’t know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ??? When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I’ve wanted to ride that one for ever. I was ??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that’s why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day hind of sucked it was still our all a great time!"
22, "A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn’t understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didn’t go with science, and he didn’t listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldn’t beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient."

17, "I was patient when my dad said he would get me some @CAPS1. They were @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 the shoes caust @MONEY1. I asked a few times. He didn`t answer, so I knew what to do. I decided the dishes, clean my room. I waited the shoes so bad; I cleaned stuff that was already clean. After a month of the cleaning, I still didn`t get the shoes. That’s how something went wrong. SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven`t ben acting right in school. I got my stuff together. Then I got the @CAPS4."
11, "Patience is a kind thing , people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. Its very poliete if you have patience, I don’t know the definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere."
23, "A time when iwas patient was a last @DATE1. My friend, @CAPS1, took me to cedar point in @LOCATION1. The place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we weren’t even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people’s seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient"
18, "Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1’s office?  Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1.  When we went in we seen this man rushed to the @LOCATION1.  We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my mom’s hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient."
17, "One day @CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoe s and a???. But when she was ordering it they said I???????????????? Part not legible it had not yet arrive??? you would????  Rosy said.”no thank you, I know??? arrive” said @CAPS1. The next @NUM1 months the dress had??? The magazine company called and said “we are very sorry for the late arrival of your dress, “ @CAPS3 we will offer no charge and thank you for your patiences.” @CAPS3 she ordered two more dresses and arrived the very next day that was still happy."
21, "I must admit there are times when I’m not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didn’t know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, “You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also."
16, "@LOCATION1 @CAPS10 sit down, my friend says." You don't need to be moving around like your a fly on tha wall." I sit down anxious to get up and move again." @CAPS1 's too many people here we're never getting in." I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so @CAPS2 thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend think its annoying and awkward. "@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here." "I doubt @CAPS1," I proclaim. @CAPS3 glance at me and I turn away. I got up and I walked away. I came back @TIME1 and @CAPS3 was gone. I sat down and talked on the phone for a @CAPS13 @NUM1 I sat and looked at everyone wandering who to talk to because I was bored. I wanted to get up so bad and move around but I would look and @CAPS10 walking in a circle and plus @CAPS4 left. I sat and wait @NUM2 @TIME1 past and @CAPS1 was getting close to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 was @CAPS5 @NUM4 and I'm @NUM5 so I knew I was next. "@CAPS5 @NUM5 your next." I think in my head like "@CAPS6." I get up and walk to the teller. "@CAPS7 you for your patience, now @CAPS12 can I help you" I looked at her and said, "@CAPS8 I would like a driving test please." When I got my paper to go in I thought to myself that I wasn't patient couse @CAPS1 seem like I was there for like a cazillion hours. I though again and think @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I was patient @CAPS1 was probably @CAPS3 that made me impatient because I had no one to goos off with. So @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 was patient in like forever but I did @CAPS13 because I was ready to leave. "@CAPS12 was wait? The driver ad teacher says." @CAPS13 I felt patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 hours. This is the time I never knew but know I was patient enough to wait."
14, Oh a time when me and my mom was patient is when we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her tags because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning we had woke ate breakfast and took our shower and put on our clothes did our hair. and brushed our teeth and bought time all that was about @NUM1 them after we did all of that we had lift then we had stayed in mouth ??? and bought time. all had got to @CAPS1 it our @NUM2 and we were both hungry so we stoped at ??? king and that was the day I had to be patient.
14, "“Patience is a virtue.” You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here’s a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, I’m going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it’s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1” services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I can’t deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pro’s and con’s of having patience thank you for reading my essay."
13, To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didn’t eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well that’s the day I stayed very very patient.
15, "There was @NUM1 girls and there mom was gay and she took them to motel for the middle childs b-day. It was all good units the moms girlfried cathy and my mom @CAPS1 went out to go get presents for @CAPS2 so it was the ddest @CAPS3 middle @CAPS2 baby meme. Well they left and left @CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They came back @NUM2 later. So then @CAPS1 was walking back to get us and I notice she wasnt in the van so I start crying when she told one that cahty got took to jail and we had no money, no was, we didn't now anyone  so we had to go to this gas station and me and my sister were siting on the curb and my mom went across the street buse the pay phone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter. Untill @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting on the cold an big us up and that show I moved to bangor from southhaven."
24, "Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn’t wait to get to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait @NUM1  hours until the plane left and we’d be on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers “I’m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up.” @CAPS1!? “@CAPS2 long will it take?” asked my mom.” About five hours, “she said. It’s a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family."
16, "The time I was….One after school I was walking home with my friends from school. @CAPS3 knowing me I wanted something to eat @CAPS3 I told my friends to come in @LOCATION1’s rest (it’s a fast food restaurant.) @CAPS1 we walk in @LOCATION1’s ,the place is crowded @CAPS3 I waited in line after about @NUM1 minutes my friends said “@CAPS2  man let’s go”  @CAPS3 I say “I’ll  meet you guys outside “ “alright” they said. A bout @NUM2 minites later it was my turn to order and I order a double stack and some fries and I got free milkshake for my patience  she asked what kind did @CAPS4 I said strawberry and I didn’t had to pay for ??? was totally free and I went outside and a told my friends I got this for free and then they said “oooooooh”, that’s when we went home."
14, "I guess you could say that patience is one of my bang talents. I go through many things that involve patience and a ve it through without awed . Everything knows that the wortplore to be patient in is church eserc?????? On chass?????.  You are up, then meel down, then start , the  sit then, @PERSON1 and ok! It @CAPS1 on forever.

I guess what  I’m saying  is  that  every  bodys different some  people  are  quiet and  someone   but, some  peak are  atutatic while  others  are  academic.  Is no different with patience"
13, "My mom is very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @PERSON1, with his homework. @PERSON1 hates every thing about doing his homework. He hates, doing his math, reading, but most of all he hates, spelling. When my mom is helping him with all three of thoose things she shows patience because since he hates all of thoos homework assignments he doesn’t always do them without a sit. When he does throw a fit she is very patient with him and works on it with him until he is done that is how my mom shows patience."
23, "This is a writing   piece  on how I had to be pacient to get a fanominall bowl of @CAPS1 @CAPS2. My grandparents had just picked my brother and  I up from our house to go get @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at cold stone. I never gone to cold stone, but my friends said it was good. So I had asked my grandparents if we could go. I was amped. When we arrived at our destination the line was huge. It was shaped like a snake. The sign said “@NUM1 minutes wait.”I was disiported. I was about to leave when I saw it. The peanut butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was staring me right in my face so I I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the front of the line I orderd peanut butter @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation. It was fantastic  @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was so smooth. I was thinking to my self how I was glad that I was pacient to envoy that amazing @CAPS1 @CAPS2. That was the time I had to be pacient to go get a fanominall @CAPS1 @CAPS2 bowl."
15, "A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend my coarse for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed.In fact she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry of topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping mycaela will come around someday. It’s been almost two years with him stalking her and she still hasn’t come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patience and be is a great kid."
8, "This is a story about patience, pateince is when someone gives you a older or specific job to do. Then you do the job or order with no @CAPS1 askd even if you dont wont to do it last week my mom told me to cleam the living room even know it was hard I still did not it.

""@CAPS12're gonna get in trouble."" @PERSON2 said, looking down. ""@CAPS13 was just yelling:"" yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @PERSON1 behind stage and said ""@CAPS12 couldn't played basketball but @PERSON1 messed @CAPS1 up for everybody."" @CAPS14 nobody played because @PERSON1 didn't have any patience. @CAPS14 I hope today he'll have a little more patience hopefully."

At around @NUM1, @NUM2 hour is over and we go to lunch. I wasn’t hungry and I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1 she wanted to eat so I waited for her and we went outside afterwards. When we go outside we like to do back walkovers,handstands,backbends,fronthandsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in @NUM3 hour it was recourse I wasn’t feeling good, I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat but we still had to wait till recourse was over then we had to ride the bus for about an hour.

I had to wait and be patiant for @NUM5 hours and I realized its ok to wait because it was a delicouse dinner and if i would have ate something else before dinner i probly would not have aten any of my dinner and if I would have ate something else before dinner I probly would not have aten any of my dinner. And that was a story with @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient."
24, "There I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on a @DATE1 standing in the blazing sun. I could feel the sweat drip off my face. I looked ahead there was a least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS7 was silent because they were getting irritable. All of a sudden this guy screamed, “@CAPS6 up!” @CAPS7 in line started screaming at each other except for me. I didn’t want to yell because it would get @CAPS7 worked even more. A hour later everybody chilled out. Then I looked ahead. @CAPS10 were almost to the front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said, “@CAPS8 hoo!” @CAPS7 looked at me like I was from a different planet.  My ??  “what?” my mom asked.  “@CAPS10’re almost to the front!” I replied.   Then @CAPS10 were next to go on the ride. When @CAPS10 entered the ride I fastened my seat. Next the ride took off! The breeze felt good against my face. When the ride ended I said, “ I knew patients: would pay off.” That is the time I had to have patients."

So I had to go walk around with him. I was relived because standing and doing nothing for @NUM1 hours gets boreing real fast.

20, "The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead” and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong"
24, "I’m currently writing my comic book, I havent begun drawin it yet. Here is a major scene in the @NUM1 book. “@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?” @CAPS2 asked with curiosity “@CAPS3. not yet” @PERSON1 replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost. “Are we there yet?” little @CAPS2 asked again. “@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you’ll just have to be patient. “@ORGANIZATION1  said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So the walked for hours, but still @CAPS3 sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was egar to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 could @CAPS9 that @CAPS2 was tired, lifting her on her shoulders she said t @CAPS2, “@CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 the castle from here @CAPS2.” @CAPS11 a few long patient minutes, @CAPS2 finnly saw the castle “I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it!” she said with a smile. Jumping off of @ORGANIZATION1’s sholder, she bolted down the narrow path way. Because she had waited she was as excited as ever. Not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient."
16, "A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient.  I waited in the waiting  soon for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called  me in. first  she told me what she going to do,  second she  took a x-ray of my teeth , third she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth, fourth @PERSON1 put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience."
24, "“so @CAPS1 do you want for your @DATE1?” “A @NUM1” “@CAPS1 else do you want?” A @NUM1” I have been wanting a play station @NUM3 for so long. It’s my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I don’t want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. “hey mom when are we having the family party?” “@DATE2.” @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isn’t patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now I’ll be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldn’t have made it. Im not very patient."
16, "A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1 new phone. See in @DATE2, I spelled orange juices on @CAPS1 phone. Everybody would call me weired and responsible. At first @CAPS1 phone was fine and everything alright. Then one day @CAPS1 speaker stopped working. I could call anyone or  listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first lasted and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned,so i couldn’t figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said “You are going to have to wait until I get the money.” @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone."

13, "Patience is when you are waiting on something. When you rush that’s not being patient. When you are being patient you don’t rush. @CAPS1’s another meaning of patience to when you stay calm that’s being patience staying from getting angry. Some people say they are losing @CAPS1 patience that means that @CAPS1 about to get angry. Those the meaning of patience @CAPS1 was a time I was being patience.  I wait for @CAPS2 to come.i wait, I wait, I wait I didn’t rush they say @CAPS2 is @CAPS4’s birthday. In the bible it say be patient and I did. It wasn’t no telling when was @CAPS2 was coming I still wait and finally!  @CAPS2 came."
10, "In my opinion, I am a very inpatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something , they’d better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! and when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! Overall I think people need more patience these days."

My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversery dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2’s pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parent are out, they’ll be back in a few hours, I’ll ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, “I don’t know.” And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied “finally!” @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, “@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!” @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, “@CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long. Thanks for being @CAPS6 patient!”"
15, "Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can’t be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when he’s going to get what he wants. I’m not like that. I actully have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three day I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn’t drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @DATE1 but since you were patient they came early."
14, One rainy day my dad's leg was brothering him. He took medican but that didn't work so we took him to the hospitle in coro. They looked at his leg and they told us we had to the hospitel in covent hospitle in @LOCATION1 so we got on our way to @LOCATION1. When we got to the hospitle these was like @NUM1 people in the wating room. My dad had patience to wait. When we had to go in the room. My dad had to get x-rays. He was also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong. He had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgey on his legs well after he had all the patience he had to go through surgey. He had enough patience to go through surgey. It is a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better I didn't think my dad had enough patience.
24, "I elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago,” @CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, “not much longer now dear.” @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but can’t help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope.” @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now.” @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. “You know it’s funny,” @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. “@CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there!” I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that I’m a patient person.  stand in the"
7, "Patient is like your waiting for something and you don't complain its taking to long, and your just sitting there waiting quietly. Here is an example. One time I was waiting to go get a check up at the docters and your sitting there quiet reading a magazine and just sitting there. Theres an example on being patient"
17, "I have been patient lots of times in my life but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so exited about building. Left in my reach we had been planting it for a while now and we started on a @DATE1 after school was over we got like half of it done that day but there we couldn’t work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had ?? or ?? so I had to wait a week  just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time thogh because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month but now I could finish my work and I was so exited. A few days later we finally finished the walls painted a blue and gold for u of @CAPS1 and my left as all we had to do was put my dad in my left then it was ready to sleep in. I was so happy that we had finally finished my room and I could sleep in it."
20, "“@CAPS1 you buy @CAPS10 yet?” I yelled across the room “@CAPS2 not yet lets get @CAPS10 @CAPS4” my dad said back to me. I was buying a sooter on the internet and @CAPS10 was being shipped from @LOCATION1. @CAPS10 said the scooter will get her in five to eight buisness days. “@CAPS3” I yelled as I bought @CAPS10 “@CAPS4 all that’s left to do is wait. The next morning  I woke up at six am to catch the bus to school during on my classes all I could think about was the scooters. Patience @CAPS5- patience, I thought. After school I would go to close country intill @NUM1 when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finaly come “I cant wait any more” I yelled. After close country my mom drove me home and I cprinted to the main box “darm @CAPS10!” I said “@CAPS6 yeah the website tried to charge our credit card extra money so we had to cancel @CAPS10. “@CAPS7 @CAPS5” my mom said “lets buy you a new one” “@CAPS8” @CAPS9 scooter finaly arrives three buisness days later. “@CAPS10’s about time” I said with joy."
19, "“@CAPS1 are we there yet?” I keep asking over and over again. “@CAPS2 but almost,” he replied. Today we are going to @LOCATION1 adventures and I am so excited! After I asked my @CAPS1 when we would be there, about @NUM1 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line  to get are tickets was long but not to long. Once we get them we went to go look for a lock to put all of are stuff in! The line far that wasn’t long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! The time we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome e rides! “@CAPS3, man!” is what I would get saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom man these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I arent into the gift shop: we were in the for about @NUM1 minutes waking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check out line wasn’t long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasn’t long! All that day I was a very patient girl! Between everything that went on throughout that day!"
7, A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade and I had to wait to play football till this year. I was patient because I waited for a long time without doing anything.
24, "My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience."
13, When I was getting ready to leave my uncles ranch. I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the @NUM1 on to the tryler. It has been @NUM2 hours and my dad has not come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my @NUM3 off the tryler because it was to heavy and my dad was still riding his @NUM3. When my dad got back my brother went to go ride his @NUM3. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything and leave but finally my mom and sister wanted to leave to so they finally helped me.
17, "Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home!"
22, "The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beutiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2 and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get, coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, ect…. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food thats what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father."" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" @CAPS13 take in some off the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep."
21, "Have you ever got annoid because someone kept saying be patient? I have and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to @LOCATION1, the plane ride wasn’t as bad as what @CAPS1 gonna tell you. When @CAPS3 got to @PERSON1 @CAPS3 had to pass through @PERSON1@NUM1 border it was hot!!! I think tempeture hit @NUM2? @CAPS3 had to wait in this small room with about @NUM3 people, and they had no A. C. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after @NUM4 hours a bus arrived. @CAPS3 were getting on as about @NUM5 people came barging in front, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 miss that bus. Then @CAPS3 waited again for a bus the after @NUM6 hours a bus arrives agains @CAPS2 were trying get on then again @CAPS3 get pushed out of the way. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus I was @CAPS2 fustrated @CAPS2 did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousand’s of flys all over the place. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 waited after @NUM4 more hours a bus arrives but my little brother was in the bathroom @CAPS2 @CAPS3 missed that bus @CAPS2 my mom was telling me to calm down and be patient @CAPS2 I stayed patient until the @NUM8 th bus came, @CAPS3 got on but the bus didn’t go where @CAPS3 were suppose to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had to go back to the same place @CAPS3 were in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long @CAPS3 were waiting @CAPS2 once the next bus arrived after @NUM9 hours and @NUM10 minutes he held everybody else up let me and my family get on, and tolled the driver “take them by there self,” @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had the bus to our selfs, and you know what it was all worth it."
23, "Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it’s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?”"
15, "This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I haven’t had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom. I had confidence that my mom would by me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes."
15, "Ah patients I know a lot of people have trouble being patient let me tell you a story about me being patient.I rember when last year when I was @NUM1 @CAPS1 went on a trip up @CAPS2 to go fishing for a week it was a two hour drive staright thaught I was really exited @CAPS1 left at exactaly six that morning I was happer than a lack to go on this trip @CAPS1 hit the night way.

There just waiting to see what our camp site looked like waiting patiently @CAPS1 finaly got there that was when I @CAPS4 to be patient."
15, "My story about being patient is the time I was I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes to get on the, “@CAPS1 of @CAPS2” which is this really cool ride. First thing I did in line was to try to talk the people because I knew I would be in line for a while. I said “hi” to the couple in front of me and then we talk for a while and it turns out that they had come down south from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1 which is really close to @LOCATION2 where I live and it seemed so wierd being in @LOCATION3 and meeting people who lived right across our town, then time seemed to fly by because before I knew it we were getting strapped in our seats and away we goooooo"
15, "One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom’s lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should fix the lamp. It was hard and the pieces kept falling off. It took mere patience to fix it. Finnaly, no managed to fix it. Patience is always good to be patient."
9, A time when I was patient was  when my little sister was in the bath tub for four hours taking a bath. But I was waiting for her to be done.
20, "Finally , the day was here! The new roller coaster @CAPS4 michogg’s  adventure we open! ?? couldn’t wait! Only one thing stand in my way to go on the ride, the drive. We cramed oursclues into the old minivan, and set @CAPS4. After @NUM1 minutes. “Are we there yet?” my brothersaid. Finally we arrived.

Twice as much people were lined up. “@CAPS4 least there wont be as much people on the other rides, I said @NUM3 was very paitent to go on the ride, even though it lost @NUM5 hours"
16, Patience @CAPS1 and my mom were sitting on the coach and we were going to go to the store to get groceries then go to school cloth shoping.  My sistr didn’t really won’t to go but my mom made her so she was already mad about that but we went and got food that she apparently “din’t like” but she just being her normal! Self esteem and greedy. “we are here” said my mom we are at @CAPS2 to go shopping to my sister. She dosen’t like @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 or are like I do  mabe cause she dosent think she can fit them but anyways we do in and she dosent see anything “she likes” so she starts throwing a tempestan ?? my mom was so patient with her. I couldent belive it so we lost to of her name and she took @CAPS1 to my spares.
22, "It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk like usual. @PERSON4 isnt usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and @PERSON4 had thought in his head that it was the one of the best answers. @PERSON4’s hand shot straight up in the air. One of the first hands raised. “@CAPS1! Lots of answers.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry said. @PERSON1 berry is kind of more of a round person, with some big glasses to see. But all of the students love her as an @CAPS2 teacher, “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 whats your answer?” @CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Okay @CAPS6.” “@CAPS7 language?” @CAPS8 good answer though”. There were about @NUM2 more hands in the air. In @PERSON4’s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “@CAPS9 these last @NUM3 people and then we will go @CAPS5.” <@NUM1</PERSON> berry exclaimed. @PERSON4 was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “@CAPS10”. @PERSON3 said. “@CAPS11 a metaphor?” @CAPS10 answered. “@CAPS13 you’re right it was a metaphor.” “@CAPS14 darn it that was my answer!” @PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer @PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently."
19, "Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a @CAPS1 gun. It all hapened when my sister got a gun for his birth day. I went up to a target and got ready to shout that was when I got shot I went to shout, that was when I got shot.  I went to my more and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about @NUM1 or @NUM2 patients there not in in cluding me. My mom said"" @CAPS2 could take a while. I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasnt my kiday day. She called out a persons name it was hot mine. We waited for a total of @NUM3 hours and then the doctor finally called my name. After the @CAPS1 got removed I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient."
15, "Patience! Being patient can get you want and I gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn’t get it. I waited another week I still didn’t get it. When my birthday came, (@DATE2) I finally got my matai scoot! I was so happy! That’s why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!"

18, "When ll was going to @LOCATION1 with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at @TIME1 am so we were there at @NUM1. We waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and @PERSON1 were playing video games, and my mom was reading ,When we finnaly got on the plane it took three hours to get to @LOCATION1 and no one complained then either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complaind for five hours!"
7, One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game I had wait a while so went to my friends last of sitting and watching I am never patient when theres food involved I don’t like to wait for my food it sucks when I have to wait.

11, One day I went to the store with my mother and there was @CAPS1 old lady in front of us she couldn’t do anything she was moving very slow And  I know she’s @CAPS1  old lady. But she was moving really slow And I reAlly don’t hAve pAtient’s  @CAPS2 some people do.
13, "There is only one time a year I'm patient for something, and that is @CAPS1. I can never wait for @CAPS1 to come. I got to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, every body. It is the best time of the year and it is night next to my birthday."
10, "Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade my math teacher’s assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people."
17, "One day I woke up and looked outside it was snowy +cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn’t feeling well so my mother checked my tempture and said I had a??? .I also had a runny nose so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1 and she said she would stay from work to stay home with me. So she made my hot chocolate and breakfast every time I need something she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food or even another blanket she got up and got it for me. She was patient because every single time I asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what I asked her to do. She even went up town to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and patient."
9, A time that I was patient was when my family and I was going to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We were standing in line for hours. My legs were crapping and paining but I didn't care was to excited to worry about anything. I just wanted his autograph and eventually I got it!
23, "A long wait   @CAPS1 ‘only four’ at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn’t care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I don’t get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I’ll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can’t wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !"
12, When I got bit by a dog I was in @LOCATION1 when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in my face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to @ORGANIZATION1 a hospitly in @LOCATION1. They hade me sitting in a hospitle bed for @NUM1 hours. Then I got shiped to hurly. And then I satin the hospitl watching  t.v. stil  watting for surgey. @NUM2 hours later I got it. So all to gether I sat for @NUM3 hours. And all that time it could of got infectied. And I got prossed a @NUM4 so they could keep there @CAPS1’s. But I hade to have patience after all I was a patient.
24, "@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1! The sound ratling through @CAPS11 cars. All  I can think about is after @CAPS6 and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and @CAPS11 heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, â€œ@CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history â€œthen I turn the page, @CAPS8, @CAPS7 one is, â€œ@CAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read @CAPS9 slow but I do not want to be the last to turn @CAPS9 in. In the writing I think â€œ@CAPS10 am I going to write about?â€� @CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and @CAPS11 head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if @CAPS9 were in a horror film. @CAPS2-@CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of @CAPS9 in @CAPS11 head at once. @CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. @CAPS2-@CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. @CAPS2- @CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble."
24, "I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1, that’s not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:” I realized tothem that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!"
19, "Ok it was atime wen I was on a bus to got texas. My mom, and my family was going  to see my great grandfather. The bus smelt good but same lady kept spraying  perfume so i had to just sleep and snack on a couple snacks. I kept gettting woke up by a baby. Everytime  i hold to go to the  bathroom there was always someone in the bathroom. Also when i was trying to sleep every one seems to get louder. So when it was time to catch some  @CAPS1’@CAPS2 my bus driver would wake us up us and we would have to get off the bus to another bus. It seemed  like  never on that bus. You had to have alot of patients or you wouldn’t be able to to just relax when the day is done. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It  was worth it because we went to six plags. If I didn’t have patience then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience."
18, "There were many of times when I was patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was getting a new basketball video game , but it didn’t come out until a mother mounth. So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out. It seemed like it took forever. It was the day befor the game came out and I lost my money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up @NUM1 more dolllers to buy the game that nI wanted.  I had to get two @DATE1 jobs so that can help me make the money that I lost . so two weeks past by then I went to the game store so I can buy the game. When I walked In the store, the manager told me there are no more copy’s of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother @NUM2 weeks, and I get very mad. So I wated @NUM2 weeks for the game and I finaly got the game. I was so mad I had to be  patient that long but I got what it was wroth. So that is my story about being patient."
22, "This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For “bragging rigts,”we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ”can you do it?”I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!"
12, Patience is when you wait for something with out complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient si icould go into a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was shimbering timbers. The line was very and when I mean very I mean long. It took me about a half of hour to get on ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these  rides have to show patiene because if I didn’t show patience I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk and the line took like for a whole hour. I played my nintendo as while I was waiting so it could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that ride all because of patience.
15, "Patient is when you are listening  and tolerant of how someone feels. My mom and  dad are very patient @CAPS1 me and my sister .my siter  just came and moved it @CAPS1 us  she ia @NUM1 years old. She came @CAPS2 live @CAPS1  us .It’s hard @CAPS1 a new person in the the family you always have @CAPS2 get one extra thing like a extra plate, spoon  fork pizza, supplies and thing  she need for school. Since we have @CAPS2 grt stuff we have @CAPS2 work harder my sister dosen’t do all the things that I m used @CAPS2 my parents are more patient and forgving @CAPS2 her but I know why.sometime my mom and dad all cvantg and mean but the she would  I would get in trouble for she’s older thas me but is not used @CAPS2 the way we can do things around  are home. I look up @CAPS2 my parents they are so nice @CAPS2 everyone and even ??? it’s different  know they are  still  patient."
16, "I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching . She has to teach us stuff that we don’t know. Our coach has in teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient."
16, "When me and my dad were inline for the kencer hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive so many people ??? of us and it was shocking that so many ??? ??? in line for this roller coaster we waited for what seemed like hours was only minutes, and as we got closer it was getting hard to be patient. Finally we got on the ride and it was on the ride and it was insane so waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours ??? rewarded with a ??? ???"
21, "Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!"

That was a time where I had to be patient.

13, "Every day at launch I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especialy when your waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes your lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch you can go out ride and play. But @CAPS1 you must finish your food and throw it away and wait patienty. And thats a time when I was patient."
16, One day me my mom and my brother were driving in our car. We were going to a beach when sudnly our car wouldnt move. The battery had been run down and didnt work. My mom called a tow truck and said he wouldnt be here for two hours! Me and my brother complained all the time but my mom just sat quiet so whe the truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) got to us ua ome. I was amazed by my moms patience.
15, "This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get’s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can’t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don’t get in trouble. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That’s why you need patience."
20, "I woke up at around @NUM1 am not feeling very good. I was at my friend @CAPS1 house. I tried to wait it out until he woke up, but I just couldn’t wait so I woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home so I my mom, and in about @NUM2 my mom had come to pick me up. I told her that I thought I was ground  ????????? I had to wait and wait until finally we got home it took about two hours until  ??? threw up I was horrible  ?????????? illegible"
22, "“@CAPS1” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldn’t land it. My gymnastics’ coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he see’s me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. “@CAPS1” I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn’t stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1."
17, "A time when I was patient was at the doctors. The doctor took to long and I was patient and I was patient for the doctor to come back to the room. I was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and my mom and I go to the doctors because I had an apontment. I got their and the doctor call me and took me to a room and like @NUM1 mins later he came back. All of that time we were waiting me and my mom were talking things. I like what is takeing so long and my mom said I don’t know but just wait. Then the doctor comes and starts asking me quatons like what I eat, and what I do for exersi and say. I don’t know. Then after they stepsesling the quatons they say sorry for keeping you patient and give my mom some papers then we go down stairs and I had to go to a lab to take my blood. Their was a lot of people and I was patient then they call me down and take my blood that was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctors."
10, "We’ll I’m patient and I’m in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someon you don’t like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I can’t talk to them because I’m unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they don’t my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I don’t really talk to my dad though although I’m unpatient I’m really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because I’m outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I’m outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on."
9, "Patience. Wow, you want critism; are you sure? We’ll since you asked for it,  it looks like I’m have to give it to you. Patience is @CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunties and even you and I need (@CAPS1 in these days and times. We about need it every day.) @CAPS2 does the key word patience mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, long suffering and also are able to wait until @CAPS2 you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time but, need to be. Like my daddy say to me all the time you are not going to always get or receive everything you want to so you’ll have to learn patience. That is one word I do not like @CAPS1 when its something I really want.so that is my story about patience explained my way."
15, "One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of cource he locked the door so I tried to pick it with a toothpick, it didn’t work. Then I told my dad and he said “be a man you can hold it in” so that didn’t work either so I was just about to take the door off the hinges and then he walked right out and smiled at me so then I went in the bathroom and it was soaked in water so I yelled at him and that’s wen I was patient."
10, "I’m always having to be patient. It’s because I have an older brother that doesn’t do what he is told. Let’s say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then I have to go when he’s cleaning and he won’t let me. So I’m that’s one of the reasons. Another is my older sister she’s always on the phone so I barely ever get to use it. So I wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, that’s why I’m very patient."
13, "An warrior named @PERSON1 was waiting patiently for his sword, he was waiting for an hour. He just sat quietly while every one was yelling. He was happy. All he could think of was his @CAPS1. He loved swords so much. He had @NUM1 as swords. So he was patiently to get his sword. Then he battled ninjas. He went after the ninjas because they to a boy named @PERSON2. Then he turned them to dust. The sword was made of magic. Then the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school. The warrior was the teacher and @PERSON2 was the student."
15, My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost @NUM1! then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then eleast @NUM2 minutes for my moms friends to show up. And finally an hour in line. Last but not leas @NUM3 minutes to find our seat! thank you for listening to  my report about patience and sitting through it!
15, "When I was in the sub line and in @NUM1 grade I waited patiently. If you cut infront of me, I would not care. Than when I waited for @NUM2 minutes and the line was still big. My patience meter went down after @NUM3 minutes I finally got to get a sub. I waited @NUM4 minutes for a sub that is like waiting to get pizza. Once I got to the check-out center I had no money in my account, so I was really angry, angry as in you not being paid any money for a year."
20, "A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north and we were siting out there all day and we had to have trolled up and down the chanel at least @NUM1 times. And each time we got bites but we never caught any fish. We tried our usal routine but that wasn’t working out so well, so I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandpa the idea of turning the boat around and heading towda shigle bay. He agred but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks were we were going and thats the last thing we need is for the prop to get broken off. But we took our chances and modered or we to were were were I direted him to go and as soon as we enter the bag bam! We see the pale bend down so far it was hard to believe it was a fish so I got the net and my grandpa grabed the pole and started to real we evently go it to the surface and it was a @NUM2” wallege we smiled and said looks like were having  fish to night, this is the story of when my patients were being tested by fish and then I caught the biggest one in the lake!"
11, "I was patient when I went to cediar point. I had to wait in line along tine for ??? for priencse ther was a lot of people @CAPS1 the longest word ??? drogster. I had almost anhour for a ride that @NUM1, teen  ??? that is the ???."
24, "When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. “@CAPS1’s okay. You almost had @CAPS1!” mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!"
14, On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had rememberd that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didn’t leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didnt keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one.
23, "If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1, that’s a different story. I’ll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn’t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn’t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn’t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if I’m very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait."
16, "One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting for my dad to get his clothes on. When he finally did we headed out to the woods. After that we got in a blind, as we patiently waited for fiftyen minutes. Just then a deer came in. It was a perfect doe. Finally the deer gets in front of the blind about @NUM1 or @CAPS1 and my dad quietly says ""wait for it to turn broadside."" @CAPS1 I waited until it turn and shoot the doe. Finally we get out and find my arrow but never found the deer and I had to have patient for next years hunt."
8, "@CAPS1 brother was patient ones, @CAPS1 brother was patient by understanding a tolerant. He understand a toleran by sinting down waiting. He was waiting in the doctor to get steches. I was being patient by wainging with him. We always be patient when we have to wait for something, another time I was being patient is when I always get @CAPS1 hair cut or hair line. I had to wait in a long ling to get @CAPS1 hair cut. That is some of the times I had to be patient."
13, One day I had a doctors appointment and I had to check- in at the desk and after I did that I had to sit and be patient till the doctors called me back to get my check up done  and I to wait till the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating good to and then I had to go to the check out desk to see what was my next check up was and then I had to get my pills refilled and then I went home.
22, "This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport. We were on ar way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two plains to get there. When we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in. when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. my mom told me I had to be patient but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind we decided to eat. When I was done eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my ds. Before I knew it we only had one hour left so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so that’s when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient."
11, "Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience."
12, Being patient is waiting your turn in line and @CAPS3 cuting you should wait because cuting in line is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and  @CAPS1 disrespectful. and you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you don’t wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people don’t want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you don’t wait. Be respectful and wait it’s a better way to make friends. And if someone is @CAPS3 being respectful to you tell them to be. And then walk away and say @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to @CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.
24, "“@CAPS1!!” I had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out."
18, "It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why don’t you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dad’s house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it can’t I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom’s house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I won’t get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough you’ll get what you want."
8, "Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stresful. If you are waiting to get a shot or life threat results. A way to avoid normal patience like being board is to get some notes or school work to do or an ipod. Patience is everywere. For example carrides, birthday parties, vacation commercial, school being over, restaurants, holidays or whenever you say “I cannot wait,” and etc. to sam up a few ways about patience in my way of description."
14, "Being patient is a hard task wright about. One day I was with my mom in @LOCATION1, looking for a pawn shop .We got stopped at nearly every red light on the way there .no one complained even when we reached a certain red light .Right before the light turned green a very old lady with a walker stepped infront of us we waited @NUM1 minutes for the old lady to pass .Supersising  still no one complained."
18, I’m going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom boy friend when on vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there it was pack full of people. So we jumped in line for the first ride. We were so excited that the @PERSON2 said @NUM1 teen minet wait. At first the line was moving very fast. There all of the sudden it moving like a sloth. It was so hot and humid that was alful. We checked the time it was @NUM2 minet already. It felt like @NUM3 hours. I was running out of pashents. Then we got in the shade it was a cool and nice. Finiy we were the next rid we got out the and one nice. @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 where so happy. My mom boy friend timed the rid it was only @NUM4 seconds long. We waited @NUM5 hour for a @NUM4 second rid. That was one time that I should patience.
16, "“@CAPS1” The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didn’t complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain."
19, "The time I was patient as when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue and we went to see the puppies. My mom didn’t want another dog but when she saw our future dog boxter she gave in. he has grey fur with some black spots and and a black line running down his fore. At the center of the ???. He was a grown short hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him but she said they are going in sport and we could buy him there. We got in the car and ??? to ???. we signed the forms and played with him in the store. But ??? down town with him on the sosh and we got some ice cream and went home."
11, "One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. He kept saying five more minutes, so I just sat there in the car. Finally I got out to find him a sleep with a note saying @NUM1 more min."
10, "A time when I was patient is when I was at home watching my baby brother for for my mama so she can go grocery shopping and my brother was crying cuz @CAPS2 was sleepy, hungry so I put him to bed and I had to be patient cuz @CAPS2 was a bady and my mama was gown for a long time and she had to do other stuff like shop for clothes, @CAPS1, shoes, when my brother woke up @CAPS2 was cying and I could’nt stop him from crying and when my mama pulled up @CAPS2 stop crying and @CAPS2 started laugh That’s a time when I was patient!"
23, "To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to cedar point can not wait for it to be here. I did try to make it rush by, but it didn’t work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying, “ can’t it come anymore,” but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didn’t. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient."
17, "One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of game stop. One day til  @CAPS1 @NUM1 come out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said “@CAPS2 must be a good game”. So instead of waiting at game stop I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my xbox @NUM4 then I got tired , tired and more tired so I fell aslteep on my pep game chair  till the morning. My older brother woke up and said “lets go to gamestop to get @CAPS1”. So we went to game stop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes til in was  are turn to buy @CAPS1 it  cost like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 my brother had @MONEY1 he did’nt wanna put no money in for the game and I said “I’ll pay @MONEY3 and you will @MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it tell we beat it."
17, "I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my called and said she was go send me @NUM1$. @CAPS1 I asked her when she was to send it and she said @DATE3. Today was @DATE4 so that mean I had to @NUM2 days. @CAPS1 the next day had cameup  and the ???  truck came by and I thought I had mony but it wasn’t @DATE3 yet, @CAPS1 I said, “@CAPS2.” @DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the day can past by “ @CAPS3 it! So @CAPS1 it was @DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale “The bully” the case had a yellow sticker that @NUM3 and no tax at all,@CAPS1 I was mad and @CAPS4 went home. My dad woke me up and said “its @DATE3 “ I @CAPS1 I rose up ate breakfast @CAPS1 check the mail, @CAPS1 it bills, bills,bills and “ my money” my sent we an ???. At last I said I have money, so I bought some icecream @CAPS1 I bought my favorite game “bully”. “that’s the time when I was patient."
15, "You will say that you are board very fast. Most people are cause when you get out in the woods theres nothing you can do except watch and waist if you make one noise you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patients but it is a great reward when that doe, buck or whatever you’re hunting is rite in your sight. There are sometimes that I have been impatient and there’s times that I have been patient when I was younger I was very important I would got up and walk around but when I got older I got more patient like when. I got my first deer it was an eight point. Hunting @MONTH1 take patients but I like it and its fun."
24, "When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn’t seem to notice. “@CAPS2 this is going to take forever!” I whined. “@CAPS3’t be so negative. It’s not that long.” @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. “@CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game?” @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS7, when you’re patient, you get food!” @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home."
18, "I’m going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldn’t do that."
17, "A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chiuahuce @CAPS1. It was @DATE1 and my dada sold his giutar to his uncle to get money for the day of coarse he didn’t have it. A day went by and still nothing. When my mom came and picked his ??? I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around @NUM1’oclock my dad called saying he won’t get the money till @DATE2 @TIME1! I was mad, but still tried to be patient. A few days went by and soon it was @DATE1 again. I was so excited. We finally got @CAPS2 I had been patiently waiting for a week and was tired of it. So when I was him my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good.It had really paid off."
18, "One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went up stairs to read a book. A hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I don’t know how meny times do I have to ask you to tell. Sow I was buging her all day. She said I am running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of papper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times “yikes”! My said twelve days and that is final, I said okay. I think I lerend a lesson today? Don’t bug your mom all day and do better in school!"
16, "One sunny after noon I was so waited because. I was going to see my faveret band. When I’m in school! My mom picked me up from thired gread I was so excited it was time to go. My dad droped my broter of at my grandma’s house (he was only at doy so he could not go.) I was bounsing of my seut “mom are we there yet?” I ask “@CAPS1 we have two more hou’re to we are there, then a nother hour, so we are going to see the place here.”mom said  “@CAPS2, can I have my d.v.d please.” I side. So now it has been two hours I’v been in the car. Then we went every were my mom and dad wanted to go not were I wanted to. Then it was time to go see. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! When we aroved I was a little sleepy but that would not stop my. When they only plaed two song I want to sleep on the seet. I wated all day to see them and I went to see. That was a time I was patient to see my faveret band."
13, "Patient is a very hard thing to do in life. It’s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do some times, even for little kids. You can tell when someone being patient is when there being polite and waiting  their turn without complaining about it . Sometimes people don’t like being patient I know I don’t lik to a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not ??? tuned others wait. But people who are pacient they sometimes tend to be anoying or quiet don’t talk very much even when they do talk they ??? talking when people inturupt them. And they defiantly don’t yell as someone  out at all. It’s a good thing to have patiencets because you will grow up with an ??? (part not legible) good family good friends and a ??? .So in conclusion that;s why it’s good to be patient."
11, Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So I’m happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.
19, "Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot.@CAPS1 my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said “I don’t think there is anything wrong, but we won’t be sure.” @CAPS1 she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patient because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle."
10, A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any hep. Not one comeint from me. It was so hard. I had one hour to finish it. I needed three hours to finish. It was so hard not even collage student could finish I t. @ORGANIZATION1 was the hardest match test I ever done.
23, "“@CAPS1, how much longer.” I complained at the airport, “@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.” “@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes sweety.” replied my @CAPS1 in a stern voice. “@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world.” I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I haven’@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didn’@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad don’@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more."
16, "One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I didn't have to do nothing after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we was just sitting there talking and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient."
6, "I’m writing about a time when I was patient. Because I was about to go to a party in I had to be patient but I didn’t  I had got angry in I just couldn’t patients. In I also no someone who patient. They just couldn’t wait they really couldn’t  wait but I waited, waited, waited in I got mad I couldn’t even wait no longer. I was actually was waiting on my aunt to come pick me up in she didn’t @CAPS1 I called my mom in she said she was going to take me to the party In I was patient in she didn’t come @CAPS1 I didn’t go to the party in I was mad. Because my mama didnt come pick me up, @CAPS1 I calling my grandma and she came in pick up. That was the only time I was patient of learning."
15, "It’s about three @CAPS1 clock the clock tells me, but I can’t go to sleep because my @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I are going fishing. So  it’s eight @CAPS1’clock now my @CAPS2 was suppose to be here at seven, but my grandma kept say he’ll be here, so I believe her but I was a little worried.Now it’s ten @CAPS1’clock in by know. I’m just furious I am about to cry, but my grandma said he’ll be here, in I said, “@CAPS4 he won’t in went in my room then I realize he well be here he will be here.Then I heard the door open I ran in it was him I ran in said you finnaly came in we ate then I look outside in seen the boat. That’s a time I should patience."
24, "Clunk! I @CAPS1 in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole ""look whose awake so my mom berked as annoying as possible. ""You slept for long was though him might sleep until school that back up. ""@CAPS2 are we"" asked in a dreary voice. ""ohio"" replied my mom's friend @PERSON1. We were going to @LOCATION1 with my mom @PERSON1 and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2 over spring break. We would be staying in the florid @CAPS4. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in @CAPS4. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @NUM3 day would be the hardest of there all. This was the day we would he driving through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding in the corners, the ?? the @CAPS5 ??. However when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm like her life her depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started getting up! All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop. As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved and we were pulling into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in all asylum. I will always remember that ride through the mountains."
20, "A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two hours along with my team. We warmed up and stretched and were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor. We dida head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got their and the coaches had their meeting and we stan?? The meet. That is a time I was patient."
20, "“@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?” I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes .One of these, I hoped was the letter. “@CAPS2 yet honey ,” she said “but there’s plenty of bills to go around.”  I wanted  to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said ,”  just wait long  enough and you’ll get what you want”  I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesn’t sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results .Pretty good system ,huh? No ! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!"
16, One @CAPS1 I was patient of waiting for a game to arive. I waited @NUM1 years for it to come and the @CAPS1 finele came I started out the the @CAPS1 like it was eany other. @CAPS8 the @CAPS1 just kept @CAPS4 on so @CAPS5 the time I @CAPS6 @CAPS7 I just sat the froant porch the rest of the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 it never came so I just went to @CAPS9. The next @CAPS1 I came @CAPS7 I checked the mail @CAPS11 it was empty so I  slamped on to the coach and watched tv I looked out the front @CAPS12 and the was a packeg that was just @CAPS13  it was my game and that's the story of my patients.
21, "There were many times when I was patience. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your home work. Maybe waiting days for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. @MONTH1 be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patience to get my first dog. @CAPS1 was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn’t find the right one. @CAPS1 took @NUM1 weeks til we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didn’t find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow @CAPS1."
16, "One day when I was at my sisters football game. My mom droped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked me if I had my money with me. I said no then she said your just going to be hungry. I said @CAPS1. @CAPS2 when the game started. I got really hungry. @CAPS2 I checked all of my packets, it just @CAPS2 happened that I found @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I went to see how long the line was. The the was @CAPS2 long it was almost in the street. @CAPS2 I sat back down trying to let the line get shorter. But the line had gotten way longer @CAPS2 I ran in the line. I had to stand in the line for about @NUM2 mins. @CAPS2 when I finally got out of line I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. @CAPS2 she came up to us and asked me to bye her some @CAPS3 fries. I said no because the line was to long. @CAPS2 she said please! @CAPS2 I went back in line and it moved way slower. When I got back she said, what took you @CAPS2 long. I said look at the line. @CAPS2 that is one of the times I was patience."
22, "It was a hot sizzling @DATE1 day I had descidid to ride my  dirt bike @CAPS1 I but on my helmet, boots, goggles, and gloves. I headed out the door and out to my dirt bike, started it and took off. Like a speeding bulit “zoom” I went up one of the ramp and I landid but I was going to fast around a corner and “wam” I fell off and the foot deg went into my leg. My dad came running picked me up and put me in the truck to go to the @CAPS2. When we arrived my dad had to check in after that we sat down. There was a lot of people there men women kids and babys.

The doctor took me to get xrayed when we got back the doctor said I had brused my bone and gave me crushes and said to stay off of it for a week. When we got home I laxed on the couch and went right to sleep. That was the time when I was patient for six hours in the @CAPS2."
22, "Patient help you got through life. If You aren't patient then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4 uncle had to be patient face month. He was running a muck just @CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone yelled just be patient they will call. He bid  us being patient is the hardest thing he was to do. He was dined why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting about  here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4 under was waiting for a patient ???

21, "Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car.When she got in the ca    we were off.On the way to the???  For the @CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a couple minutes,when got out of midland I thought  it would go by preety fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever.I was bored out of @CAPS2 mind and the thing s that made it worse was that @CAPS2 little sisters were screaming in the back.So  then we stoped at a gas station witch felt like forever.I preety  much never talked the whole way up there I was trying to be patient but I  couldn’t take it.I manged to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming.They finally fall asleep.I just sat there loking out the window when we where about forty-five  minutes away it felt like we have been driving for days.It was probly like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally wake up.They started screaming “Are we there yet”@CAPS2 mom and dad just keep saying “@CAPS3”When we pulled into the drive way it was probly the happiest thing that happened hat day.I thought I was preety patient on the way up there but on the way back I might just sleep.At the party I was  patient  until we could open the presents.I freacked  out.I hope next time none of that will happen."
24, "Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn’t  something they teach you in my school. There isn’t a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so ‘tick,tock,tick,tock’. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, there’s come action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient."
20, Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters’ face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.
16, When I was at universal studios and I was waiting in the long lines to get on the rides I was patient. It did take a while but I never got mad or impatient. My dad and I was in a line for this dragon rollercoaster we were so close to being next then it started raining and lightning. A lot of people left so we ended up being in the front of the line. We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while. We eventually got on the ride and we realized the wait was worth it so we went again.
23, "To @CAPS4 being patient means to not while if you ordered something and its taking long to come to you. That’s what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one poped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn’t going to be bush over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up. By the time @CAPS7 were done the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing, I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. My parents got soo annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music.” mom that our favorite song.” @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said “you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here.” @CAPS7 got into the waiting room, @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost faint because of how much people there was. “lets just calm down I mean how long will @CAPS8 take for a sudden a deep voice in my head said, “ @NUM2 hours later”. My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. “@CAPS8 you don’t crack @CAPS5 its are turn to take the pictures I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal.” @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper and a sleep @CAPS5, the @PERSON1 family your next.” The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. “@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @CAPS12 you have to do anything I want”. I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in there  life just like @CAPS4"
6, When it comes to patience you have to be relax. You have to be with your patience when you to do the doctor. When your at the doctor you will still be done being patience. When you get home you will be patience for someone. So rember make sure you patience at everything
22, "RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didn’t care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they weren’t bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now we’re at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself “be patient.” @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most."
10, One day I was watching @CAPS1. I was bored there was nothing good on. So my mom was on the computer. I told her if I can get on she was like ok. In @NUM1 mins. I waited for her to be done. Ok now you can go on. Thanks mom. You welcome. I was very patience. That’s the time I was patience to go on the computer
18, "I amwriting a story about a time when I was patient, When I was in @NUM1 grade I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1. I ordered with my mom and dad and waited. The waiter said about @NUM2 minutes. Our food didn’t come after @NUM2 minutes or @NUM4 or @NUM5 or @NUM6 or even @NUM7 minutes. Our food came after an hour and @NUM8 minutes. All the time i was waiting  I was getting more and more hungry. I didn’t start complaining or yelling I sat in my seat and waited patiently."
6, "Patience is useful in certain times like waiting for a blood test or to me your ??? again. In other times patience is usless as in the army, any army, you sometimes wait to die by the hand of your enemy .Patience is mostly good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy."
16, A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was waiting to get on the dragster the line was suppa long. We waited for @NUM1 hours long and we still was in line being patient. Finally we got up there and they said that the ride will be closed   for a while that have to check something and it took them a whole hour for them to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train @NUM2 minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to get on which was shoot the rapids the line was really long so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn we got on it was fun then when it was over we got back. On the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the line was back long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long I was about to lose my mind but we had don. And we are going back this @CAPS3.
22, "Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up keep trying and your will succeed, rush through life and become impatient and you used and succed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. ""@CAPS1 year in the fall a big race takes place. All the animals in the @CAPS2 come to the. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @CAPS1 year, one slow animal and one first around commute to see who is this up is champion. At the time the @CAPS5 was the fastest @CAPS2 around. @CAPS11 signed up @CAPS1 year and won @CAPS1 time. The @CAPS15 had signed up to complete this year. @CAPS11 was very wat don't in himself and was had to pride that @CAPS12 because @CAPS11 was about, slow and @CAPS11 can't be a champion. ""runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The @CAPS5 and @CAPS15 lined up. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4!! "" @CAPS5 rushed ahead kicking the air. For the @CAPS15 very slowly waiting behind. @CAPS5 run like @CAPS11 has never won. @CAPS11 never looked back. @CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his any ways. Right? I mean, @CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @CAPS15 continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS6 ."" @CAPS5 stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""@CAPS9 is that noise?"" @CAPS11 asked aloud. ""@CAPS6"" it came from his stomach @CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS12 one little handful of berries."" @CAPS11 decided. @CAPS11 picked a handful, then another and another. Finally @CAPS11 was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll @CAPS12 take a little nap after all that @CAPS15 ain't gonna catch up anyways."" @CAPS11 laid down and slept. Little did @CAPS5 know that the whole time @CAPS11 was eating and napping, @CAPS15 was catch up? @CAPS11 saw the @CAPS5 sleeping and decided but to wake him @CAPS12 to case @CAPS11 was sick is @CAPS11 continued to slowly very slowly walk up the hill to the inish line. @CAPS5 woke to the sound or cheering. @CAPS11 stood up. The @CAPS15 won! @CAPS11 raced to the finish line but was to late, the @CAPS15 had already won. If @CAPS11 had been patient @CAPS11 might have won."
15, "I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at ceder point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the rapter that took one hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer then the wait in line it felt like @NUM1 hours because of how ??? it was. We walked and saw the ??? force it had a ??? ??? on it so we waited in line was much longer than the rapter it was like 3-@NUM1 hours. But when we got to the hop of the stairs we were up it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped complen because he was so ??? in me. the ride was fun but when we were done we had to leave ??? was like mom. We only wait on the rides but it was fun and ??? That was a time when I was patient."
12, "My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 children’s @CAPS2 . They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other."
10, My own way about patient is that when somebody is doing something. You have to wait until they done. An if you rush them they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important thing. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you not being rude.
16, "I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my bracts put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors. I waited about @NUM1 mins. Without complaining. Next, they started putting the brackets on the glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and kido tasted like heated metal “@CAPS1” I said. After they had put on the brockets and then they put colors. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed  it had been @NUM2 hours! I was surprised because I didn’t know I sat there for @NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office."
21, "A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “@CAPS1” at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I don’t think so."
15, "There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"
18, "Once upon a time their was a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 was invited to a royal ball where @CAPS1 awaited her handome prince. As her carriage  arrive @CAPS1 stalked at the people before getting out. Finally @CAPS1 stepped out of the vehicle. @ORGANIZATION1 walked down the red carpet. As @CAPS1 arrived, the more noisy it got the princess finally aproched the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and warched the village people dance among her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. @CAPS1 wandered “will he show up?” and “  will he like me?” @CAPS1 doubted her luck. The princess grabed the microphone, “@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Does @CAPS3 know where my prince is?” “@CAPS3?” a complete silence went over the croud. Finally at the last minute. ‘@CAPS4” an anonomyse voice crosered. I am the prince!” A sigh of relif came over her. “@CAPS5 I’. I’m so late ??? fought a dragon and a thousand knights. To get here  to meet my love!” awwwww! The crowd said softly. And they lived happily ever after. The @CAPS6!"
24, "“@CAPS1!”I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ” That was @CAPS1!”@CAPS2 said.  “@CAPS3 I was already there.”I responded.  “@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it’s @CAPS1.” @CAPS13 argued.  “@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. “@CAPS7 I guess.”@CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. “@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!” the A team coach demanded. “@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!”@CAPS13 said??? Mu two best friends som and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. “You want to be partners with me and make? “@CAPS14 asked. “@CAPS15, “I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. “@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!”??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A-team! So that’s a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded."
18, "Are you patient?well I am always patient.Iam going to tell you a time when I was patient at school.One day I had to register for school it was very busy.I had to wait to every line atleast to ten to fifteen minutes.When I finally got all my paper work done,I had to take my id picture.When I took the pictures I went to get my id.All of a sudden it comes out,but my eyes were closed.So I had to wait in the line again and take more pictures.Then I went to take my other id. I waited very long,like about twenty minutes.My second id came out and it was messed up.T he lady told me when I start school,I will get the correct one.That is a time when I was patient in my life."
19, A time when I patient was during last @DATE1. My friends and I were waiting in line to get an autograph of the detrnit tigers @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was going to be exiting to meet the players???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????then left. This was a day when I was patient.
8, I was patient last year when I was when I was taking the ??? and it was not done. I hate being patient and when I do it is boring. Patients seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting head akes and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking to much. And that is why I don’t like being patient.
6, every school year I wait patiently for @DATE1 vacation. It fell like a a terify waiting for @DATE1 but it is werth it.
14, "Hi, I’m @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have green eyes, blonde hair, I have a good personality. Okay, so am going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay so it was @NUM1 last year yar @DATE1 I think. My mom and I were left for a doctor’s appointment. So we left around @NUM2 after school started. So when we got there I was just waiting for like @NUM3 hours bored out of my mind. I didn’t know what to do so I saw the fish @CAPS3 I was watching them for about @NUM4, doing nothing then finally the women of the counter desk said , “@PERSON1 then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot it hurt so bad. Then I woke up and that was the time “when I was paitient.”"
21, "We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean”  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s  text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!"
14, I was at the great wolf loge and we could not go in because some kid poop in the pool and a big part of the pool was brown we could not go in for three hours and it was very boring then we went outside and there was a pool there the hole time.
11, "A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed schoo) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my xbox @NUM1 and I got on the computer. But while xbox I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in @CAPS1. Moures @CAPS2. After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn’t work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (nowaround @TIME1) it got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online. We played all day till night"
19, "A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun  time in @LOCATION1!"
14, A time when I was patient I was patient on @CAPS1. I got to open are presents at nine thirtey in the morroning I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I wacth telavison. I though @CAPS2 would be hard @CAPS4 I made @CAPS2 through. That @CAPS1 I thougt was the funnest @CAPS4 I lied I think this year will be. That day I made breaskfest in bed. I actually had a lot of fun. I got my mom a couple things of purfoom. @CAPS4 of course she doesn’t use them I do I got her some candles we got my dad a bright orange sweat shirt. We also got him some @PERSON1.
16, "I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was to far away for me to visite he lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I’m not really the patient tipe.I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient I have to being doing something so I get myself to rest by writing stars and drawing, reading, going to any around mother house to help with our animals. And when he finally comes I didn’t even get it. Milk @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer within I guess on sit that was to do you just have to have mind on the thing you have to be patient about it."
13, "A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was a long ride. It was long because he had a nagshion that went the long way to six flag and to our hotel. I try not to complan and be patient because the ride was a daylong so that means sitting for almost a day! We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cusion that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tird. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever! At the hotel I was unpacking my stuff and notice I was patient for almost a day which I though I would never be able to do in a car. That was the time I was being patient."
16, Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @DATE1 I was so exicted. I’m not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. it’s always hard having to leave her when she’s calling your name it’s like I want to cry. I don’t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what I mean.
9, "At the @CAPS1’s office. I had an @CAPS2 appointment. At the @CAPS2 office I was waiting in the room for her to come back. Then the @CAPS1 asked me questions and my foster mom question. Then she left out she went an found the othere @CAPS1 and talked to him. Then they came back and said @CAPS4 you. here goes the papers you need. The foster mom said ok @CAPS4 you. Then the @CAPS1 said to me, “@CAPS4 you for being patient @PERSON1. I apprisiate that so much,” “@CAPS5 to I’ll see you guys next time ok.” @CAPS5 we said “bye.”"
18, "To say really I’m not a very patient person, but once I was, I don’t really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldn’t wait any longer. I “@CAPS1” and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!!"
16, "A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know."
