17, "I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride."

14, "The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for an half an hour. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time."
17, "Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again."
15, "Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad."
12, Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so that’s when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at @NUM3 a.m the next morning.
20, "It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I don’t remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, I’m sorry if I could’nt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didn’t I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient."
16, A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!
15, "My sister is very patient unlik my brothers and me. Well my sibling and me had are proggress reports coming and I was so excited to see what I got, and my brothers were anxious and we work always both a mom saying when are they coming did you them. But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she trys to keep off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even @CAPS1 because we got good grades. Then after that my brothers and me learned from my sister and now we all have patience."
17, "I know I can I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! Errg! I stood back up and asked @PERSON1 my coach, “@CAPS1 my shoulders right?” @CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder the kick over. “@CAPS3 got it” I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient.” @CAPS4 said “@CAPS5 for you baby.”"

16, "There was one time I was patient when my little brothers play station wasn’t working so it took a while to get use to it. It was an @TIME1 and my little brother had jus finished eating and he wanted to play his @CAPS1 but he was having a hard time turning it on but the problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn`t do it. So than he asked me if I can help him so I helped him but it still didn`t work until I cleared up the play station than we had to wait patiently and than finaly at??? but  my little brother and I say “ work, work, work, work” until it went on. Then this day we still say that for the @CAPS1 can work."

My mom had to have paicents so i just fell asleep while standing with my eyes open. My mom had to have patient when we were in traffic  to get to the camping grounds. We had to wait @NUM2 hours just to get out of traffic but mom didnt freek out or anything.
10, "Tic tak times tiking  I was patient one time it was in the doctors office my oppment was at two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait I sat there until it was @NUM1 and they finnly called me in. Once again I had to wait and wait again. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust me it is not easy for me at least because I can’t even sit there for @NUM2 minitues and stay still I have to move aroud so it was hard to sit there  lisening to the sound tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was pacient it was hard to belive but I did it. The hardest part was when you here one off those tiker clocks go tik tok and I was stinn there for a while now you absolutely now that for some people incuding me. It is sometime hard for you to be pacient some times its ok to be pocient and sometimes its so hard to be pacit and sit there and oh absolutely noting, so that is my story arbout the time I was pacient and was not inpocit sitting there doning noting not conplaning  wating  to and @CAPS1 mazines."
24, "Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know lur lne being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom il just not pretty. But one time l really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride."
14, A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients.
9, "Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."
18, "A @DATE2 ago my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because of her incision from a previous operation panste open. Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it."
14, I am writing about a time when I was patient. Me myself @CAPS1 not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus to come but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So my mother said “@CAPS2 stop complanning and be patient @CAPS1 serious!” so as soon as I sat down the bus came!
6, Patience is to be quiet in lines wate to do some thing or going some were suntiel to be ??? and not ??? like ??? the wall and going crazy about wating for some thing wait to get a ??? game our wait to get a ticiket to go the the show to see a movie theis are way you could be pantient while do different thing in life. Like a day I was waint to get a game in line but it took so long to get it but I stay in line and used paintion.
21, "That is the time I was to be patient.  Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went “@CAPS1” then the lady and I had ?????????? for an early ?? mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for…."
16, "The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted saad on their he did everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 mineuts. We went around the mall and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 mineuts. So I asked the guy is it done he said ""not yet"" I was watching him doing another guys hat. So he stopped the other guys hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat that took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat & I was happy."
8, "This is my way of patience: patience is power without patience where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? Yaid probalay be going crazy because you don’t want   to be living in a trashy trailer, camper or even a house! What about if your in a doctor’s office for @NUM1 hours! Yes your going to be agitated! But, see if you have patience your going to be able to wait patience is power!"

13, Every day I have this kid sit by me on the bus. He is annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We usely et a long but we debated about things sometime. He tells out rages story about @CAPS1 and snipers. He’s not really my friend but he come one to talk to. I think if I listen and talk to this kid is a god sent mission because he doesn’t have many friends.
24, "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."
20, "Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait."
14, "One day when I was going to @LOCATION1  we drove for @NUM1 whole day because we went in the wrong direaction and my mom got made at night we were trying to find a hotel about @NUM1:30am I was the only one aware because my three brothers @PERSON1, @LOCATION2, caman were sleping in the back of the van my sister @CAPS1 and me were in the front and I got really angry because a guy. Look the last room they had but I was really angry patient and really we a room the next day we went to the @ORGANIZATION1 to stay we were going to the water park/musment park there was a new ride"" the scoping tail butt we had to wait for @NUM1 hour to go on that ride and I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because  it took so long then the next day it rained and rained so we went to the indoor fool at our hotel but we couldnt go in because there were in many people so we had to wait but I wasnt patient because I wanted to go swimming  the almost a halve hour we got to go swimming then the next day we had to leave and this time it took almost two days to get us back home the time & we got there was at @TIME1 I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house then we finally got to go to bed I was so happy."
12, "Supper beast patience I was coming here from school are day on the  going bus so @CAPS1 what felt live  @CAPS2 I finals got have I ran inside I saw my high school bro with a box of pop I asked  blare here did you set the mong  for that is allows need mong .

I thought now he is so patient with me, he could of killed me and he didn’t??? next week he save me ??? back and he last hit me sence ."
19, A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.
16, One time at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times I just waited there quitley and patiently. I was waiting for about @NUM1 min for some to come and when some one did come they said thank you for being so patienet and ringed me up so I could leave. That was a time I was patient.
16, "One day we were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to see the president of the united states of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 when we got to the park where we going to see him there were cars parked a mile away! When we finally parked the car we started walking it was a long walk but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! after we got through security we though we would never get there. Me and my parents stood in that I think for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and look their places sang the national anthem the president stepped up to the podium and gave along speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in and I was very patient."
18, "“left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boys arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! “@CAPS1!” the old man yells “my boy.” @CAPS2 says “you are lacking patience.” The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 puts a blind fold on the boy named @CAPS3 and let’s jolbs sand bags during at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks the second one and busts it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one. The boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first."
17, "A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip ,she moved slower than my grandpa you are probally asking yourself  hour does this make her patient ,@CAPS1 @CAPS2  had to follow her every where she went if @CAPS2 wasn’t patient I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in @CAPS2 mean @CAPS2 took here almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom . Normally I’m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I’m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .Being patient is a good thing, you look at life  different .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I’m not glad my mum get hurt but I’m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom."
22, "I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1""  ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. "" @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened.""  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you. Started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day."
8, One thime i was in the doctors office and there was alot of people there and I was just getting there and my dad was telling me we should go because there are so many people and I said lets be puctiont and wait and he did so person after person and my dad was pactiont so it was @NUM1: hours till they caled are name and we went in and I got my five and vaxsene shots and we left and we went home and ate diner we not taco saled for dinner.

But a ups truck came and didn’t see it and guess what in the package was my as! I didn’t even realize it till @DATE1 I was so happy that I got it. That I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient see ya."
24, "Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day."
15, "My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights untill we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there."
15, "One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . Then we seen a sign  that says “you are how leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are how entering @LOCATION1 and that’s when  it happened the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m how smart was that not very but the worst part was the waiting I t  lasted for hours just sitting there but we found ways to away ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience."
21, "Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for @CAPS1 city, I @CAPS2't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were standing. ""@CAPS3 you please finish packing see I really want to go! "", I exclaimed ""You'll just have to wait a minute, ""Do ?? But I @CAPS2't wait, so I grabed??, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags @CAPS4 their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look. He thanked me, saying ""@CAPS5 for being so patient, and just for that, mom and have surprise. For you. He set down the sultans, and briskly walked over to a white plastic had the suddenly pulled at a rectangular favor it was the some in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7?????? it wash ? you????????.

22, "That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”"

We had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three.

In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.

14, "I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive."
6, I saw someone @CAPS1 patient the got to a rest runt before I did and den I orderd my food and it came. They done sill had no food so I left and finally they got the food now that’s what I call patiants.
18, "When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me."
18, "The I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there. We went to this lady and wait for the doctor call us. We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn`t want her to do the other. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn`t she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn`t so bad."
12, "Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing."
14, "Anna sat there waiting patiently, come on come on come on! She thought to herself, meets, and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go,only making her situation more difficult she took a deep breathe,and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges"
12, "A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She @CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on @DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" @CAPS6, I said. Next day was @DATE2. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. ""@CAPS11 I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back @CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle @CAPS14 dog. I said, @PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I @CAPS11 move on @CAPS4 body hurt. So @CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where @CAPS16? @CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in @CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for @CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for @CAPS4 mom's @CAPS1."
16, "A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too."
24, "Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom."
18, Once apoon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut “at mtso fast saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente  land renamed it @CAPS2 land from that day forward every body was pacient.
18, "A Time when I was Patient  A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient."
4, "When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal .I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .I went to @ORGANIZATION1 .I said ,”@NUM1 @CAPS5 please “ @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said ,” @NUM2 days ago “ I was like “ wow “ @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend she said ,” get down there now I was like  wow."

By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn’@CAPS6 ask he once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up @CAPS2!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. “@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?” “@CAPS5” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
23, "I showed patience before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off."
23, "Middleton middle school, I’m one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."
22, "I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minny van.

After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."
22, "Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"
16, "I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore."
8, I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers and I told my mom to wake me if she gets oyr the computer and after an hour I fell asleep and I woke up after a little while and my brother was on for three hours reading manag we already have and after three minutes my dad kicked me off to check his email and he said he would be off soon yet he spent the rest of the day a  hit more of the next day watching indearath  star(for six hours even though he spends eight hours on a connecting at work so that adds @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the internet everyday of the year.
21, "“When do ve get the xbox!” I asked @CAPS1. “@CAPS2 hours,” he replied. “@CAPS3!” “yes.” “@CAPS4.” “@CAPS4.” @CAPS2 hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” @CAPS13 then I said, “@CAPS14,” and then fell asleep. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered."
12, "A time I was patient. @CAPS7 were going to go camping, so @CAPS7 got packed up and loct the car cide was @NUM1 hours long so i had to be patient. I played @CAPS4 ps @NUM2 for a cupul of minutes it was @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 left early so @CAPS7 could Do some thing when @CAPS7 got there. Then I tried to @CAPS1 I was so ticed.

17, I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.
23, "A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient."
11, "Patience is the key to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things."
14, One time. My cousin in patient because she was going to the mouie @CAPS1 a party. @CAPS1 it was a lot of kids at her house @CAPS1 she had to clean up the house before her mom come home.

20, "I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort @PERSON1. It was @NUM1 my mom was on time prepare ???. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grcery state. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. After what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day."
21, "One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie."
24, "There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!"
20, "A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients."
20, "One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper."
20, "Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners."
10, A time I was patient was when my family and I went to west viragna. And we had to wake up early to get on the road show we would’n have to go in traffic. Show are on the round and when we get they had a nice house. But we had to want in a long line just to get in a resturant . and it took them @NUM1 just to get us in. And we had a happy dinner. that a time when I was patient.
22, "What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient."
8, The time I was patients with my little brothers! I was baby sitting and they wouldn’t lison to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them after that all went well.
14, My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it it took a hour just for her to get in. and she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that. I sat and read magazines why I was waiting she finally came out. When she was the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day.
13, Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.
18, I rember when I was at luck if steak house and the lady said we have to wait a half  hour before we sit down. I thought I was going to die but my mom said to be patient. So about twenty mituens left I was about to scearm but I sat on my chair waiting didn't say a word. But I waited excienley and bould out of my mind. Ten minuets left and I am about to explode I want to eat but I can't but I still didn't do anything did not talk ??? got the bathroom. @NUM1 left I am calming down and about ready to eat still didn't say anything or do any thing. The ??? can kuinly eat and cum so happy then we ordor is mitens later are food comes out and that was the most patient I have ever ben in my life.
19, "A  time   when   I  was  patient  was when  I  went  to  the  doctors. When  I  went  to  the  doctors  for  a  checkup, my  appointment  was  at  @TIME1 and  we  didn’t  get  called  till @NUM1.  I had to wait a long time! Finally  when  we  got into the  doctors room  the  nurse  did my blood pressure and then  I  had  to  wait  another  @NUM2 mins  for  the  actuall  doctor. By the time the doctor   actually came it was about @NUM3.  I  got  my  flue  shot  and  the  swine  flue  shot.  When  I  was  all done  it  was  @NUM4  I was  ready  to  go  home.  That’s  a  time  when  I  was  patient."
24, "This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello."
14, Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.
16, "Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."
16, "This is my story about being patient, I close my hope to be ""write a stay about also you was patient"".

5, My dad can be very patient sometimes. When he’s not angry.
12, Thompson volleyball playersaka @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lost our tournment. We went on @DATE1 at a @CAPS3 resturant. And you know @PERSON1. She had asked for some chopsticks and the @CAPS1 made us wait for @NUM1 minutes for chopsticks. So @CAPS4 a volley ball player asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get none.I was really made at the waiter but I had fun and the other aris had fun!
17, "I was wating for my grand pa to get home. He was gone to an aumish sale to find me a chicken coop for my chickens. I was helping my grand ma can. I the maring. I was so exited for him. To get home. Then I went outside. I was doing work to pass the time. I first cleaned the barn. Then I did the cattle @CAPS1 I fed them walked them then wattered them, then I cleaned chiken coop. Then I did chicken @CAPS1.I collected the eggs. I fed them and I watered them. then I had some fun, I worked on volleyball. Then I practiced hitting and piching for softball. Then I worked on shooting hoops. Then I rods the gator for a little while. Then I went in for @CAPS2. When I came back out I thought what can i do . Then I saw the ??? hill.I know I wuld thrush some ???.So I got out the slasher went to the field @CAPS3 thrashing. I loaded the track to. Then when I got back to put the other tractor out and attached the header to do   I went out and worked ground, when  I got back I was thinking what am I  @CAPS4 to do know, when I hear same and pulling it was my grandpa. We get in the track to town."
20, "Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever."
18, "This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took olday to give it to me . I waited so patient. Other people was ??? in ???  there ??? they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food . I told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long. So I went back in the food store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it’s coming in a second. Then I set down in the food store and I looked and so my friends coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patient for are food. Their names are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @PERSON1. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1 , I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I’m about to go home, after that I left. Thats a story about a time when I was patient."
11, A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in @LOCATION1 and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him that I would not tell on him even when I busted my chin open the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everybody else and then I was being swarmed like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey. That was when I was being patient.
13, One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go to micigman adventure so I was waiting till he would come home is and then my dad told me that I should get ready to go so like to back up my shorts and ??? ???  that so I did that then I just sat there for about ??? was then I called him and he said ??? ??? I
17, "There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end."
24, "Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned."
10, Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. you just walk around like honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come. If your inpatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to. This one tim I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. And we never got mad just a little board. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad didnt  come home until the @DATE1
18, "Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient.” I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles."
16, "One time was the often best friend I had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how . When we sat down in the rollar coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for."
19, "One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs."
8, "I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting. For example “you were very patience in line for cotton candy”, said the clown. You know something like that I know this a short story, I’m sorry."
18, "One day I was at my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 house to celebrate my cousins @CAPS3. He was turning @NUM1 years old. So we played games played on the trampolenc. They we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with there dog after a while. Then a lot of people came over. We went outside for a third time played. We had to come inside and @CAPS4 up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeen, beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tisue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to domine. So I walled waited ??? then finally I got to do my project but I was ?? Only one there sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all. Being patient con get you very far in life. You have to be patient in a job, restraunt, and lots more. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patien will guide you through your hole life."
12, I remember the time when my there older sister was so patient fo her birthday on the “fourth of @DATE2” man she was patient every time I ask her can you what until your birthday she said yes I can what until my birthday I can’t what untill my birthday because it is in “@DATE1” untill “fourth of @DATE2” she was so happy I just can’t believe that she wated for her birthday she went to her freinds house did some shoping of her own and fire works was in the air my sister well that is how my sister was patient.
24, "I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way."
9, One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut infront of me to get some food. And when me and my brother both had to use the bath room I let him go first even though I was first in line.
24, "Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me."
12, I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. Trying to build the whole store and I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I started to get real; mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tryed to go slow so I couldn’t use it. The only reason why I didn’t complain was because most of the stuff and the bascket was mine. That was a time I was very patient
16, "Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient."
9, One time I had to be very pationt. I had two wait five hours before my grandma to get to my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did and I was very happy. Some examples too shels stay patient are… @NUM1. Focus on something else @NUM2. @NUM3 too someones house for a while. @NUM4. Or even tack a nap @CAPS1 are examples of staying patient.
14, A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at cedar point. There was a two hour line and me and my friend were getting bored. There was some music but that didn’t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever.
17, "I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time."
18, "One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient."
9, The @CAPS1 out in @DATE1. One day when my aunt @PERSON1 was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse so my aunt @PERSON1 and she went to go fix it and it didn’t work so she ??? calling my mom and he connection got lost so then we got our generator and watched the news and my mom got stuck in the highway ??? I was worried so the we finally got our phones to work and some of are family came and we were so mad cause nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient.
16, "One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!"
12, One time me and my dad were at a store.There was a line about @NUM1 people my dad and I were starting to get impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still not calming down then the very first person left and then was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go.
12, I was patient when I was waiting for a guy to ask me out::) and I’m still dating him this day. His name is @PERSON1 and yes he goes in my school when he asked me out I didn’t now what to say cause he took to long and I still did not like another guy but him. When someone patient that don’t rush threw they wait for something or someone like I did. When I was patient I didn’t ask him @NUM1 times I waited until he asked me out cause if someone doesn’t like they might turn you down and hurt you. Okay well if you don’t want to take my advice get hurt.
17, "I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I was only hunting squirls but still. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So that’s my story on patients."
20, Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would’ve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience.
8, "The time I waited for party to happen. It was @DATE2 until I’ve been invited to a party at zapzone. He told me the party was on @DATE1. @NUM1 weeks he told me that, and still didn’t have the party the he told that I had pay for myself accepted. But it was a party so I didn’t have @NUM2 weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes. I came back he said he already had a party. He wasn’t there because a party takes an hour or two so I just let it go."
16, "When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don`t care cause I didnt eat the fries. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have patience."
23, "We climbed in the rental car waving goodbye to realitives as we drive back to the airport. “I can’t believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my @CAPS4. “@CAPS1 I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport smelling that strafoam smell, and checked in our bags. “@CAPS2 to @LOCATION1 @NUM1, @CAPS3.” @CAPS4 explained to the clerk “@CAPS5 sorry according to this your @CAPS10 is full” she told us through a chessy smile. “@CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” “@CAPS5 sorry @CAPS6 it wouldnt be fair if we gave away @CAPS2 that were rightful owned.” @CAPS8 again another chessy smile “@CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like,” @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4 I knew the place inside out. Soon it time to leave suddenly the speaker came on @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 has been deylayed by an hour and a half” @NUM6 now really? Luckly my @CAPS4 took me to an extotic restraunt. Beautiful restraunt soon it was time to leave. Please don’t get delayed again?! It wasn’t. I felt happy that we finally left @CAPS8 sad. I learned a great lesson about patience! It’s not hard @CAPS6 not impossible."
10, "I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and I waited till he had time to put gas in it. When @PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but he had to wait and then asked the question"
10, One day when I was patient was when we all had to go on the same ride at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1’s out we where going to go on this one ride and there where tons’ of people in line for it and I had to wait patient in line because I was in the back of the line and we where there for about an half hour waiting for to go on the ride and then we wait there patient and the ride was dumb and it is not even going up @NUM1 sets of stairs and then we went on a whole bunch of water park rides and then went home.
18, "Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."
16, "A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My kept saying “@CAPS1 you will be able to go out”. My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom said. After an hour past I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not. She wasn’t being patient. That is a time when I was patient."
16, "A time I was patient was when my sister got her lisense. When we got thare she pulled a ticket out of a michenie then it said # @NUM1 the screen said @NUM2. I said well this should be short, @CAPS1 no like every preson was a half an hour @NUM3 min if were lucky. We stayed thare for @NUM4 hours strait I hope it dos not take that long for my lisence."
9, "Being patience is like being a good person. If you are patiat, then good ??? will inffent to you. Some patience people got ??? good ??? like moving, ???, and ??? but some patience that you do could ??? you the bad ???"
11, Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.
16, "It was a light breezey morning. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient."
17, "Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field."
19, In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.
15, "A A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines."
24, "Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad."
13, "Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient."
18, "My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, “@CAPS1’s one mom” “sweet,” she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience."
16, "“?? Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1.” I looked at the clock. Five thirty. “you’ll have to wait.” I said. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on till eight.” “@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1 . he ???Not again. I thought. Do we have to go through this every day. Why don’t I still have ???. I walked slowly to my room, knowing I would have to keep ??? @CAPS2. ??? until eight oclock “kumehnn“@CAPS2 quiet.” I was starting to mad. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on until eight okay.”"
18, "I am never patient. Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room."
22, "My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient"
23, "Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks."
24, "Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed ”@CAPS3 is going to have babies”then I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now’ I told my sister, @DATE1 . “I wouldn`t doubt it,’ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. “then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!"
20, "I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient."
22, Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient
15, "Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. @NUM2 weeks “I thought well that’s going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I glamced at the clock. It said @NUM4, “I said,” @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. So I started to play a game and I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box. I’m like, wow did it fly by. I guess if you don’t think about it and be patient it will be over in no time."
11, "This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do."
17, "I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while."
7, "It’s like when your wating in line thats patience. Or like when you kep on rasing your hand the techer kep on saying do your work and you does l it a gen she will say, if you do that agen you will go to the chouse room. Thats when a teacher loses her patience."
14, "I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!"
19, "Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4’t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “ @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing “he added. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded!."
22, "Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. “@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isn’t even moving.” @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasn’t being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? “@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.” A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5.” @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasn’t for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .” @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he’s all big and can di anything he wants. “@CAPS8, little man you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5. “ well , too bad .” while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasn’t really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  “@CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. “@PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park’ @CAPS15 in line please, “  “ @CAPS1 that’s me …. Won.Were “was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient. And the worst when your not."
8, "Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have."
12, "Every day I must be patient in difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring. I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations."
20, "Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”"
17, "A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else."
13, "There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!"
12, "I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."
14, "ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten."
8, I was patient went I had to wait for my grandpa in the er. For his hart because his not doing very go my grandpa is in and out of the er. For my grandpa heat  everyday my grandpa has to go see has decert to chuck up his heart any that is why I am on patient.
15, In this narrative essay I will write about @NUM1 different times when I was out had to be patient. Such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final so as in the ??? all these times I had to be understanding. One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient.
15, "A  time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to get my hair cut. That was a time I was patient"

6, A time when I was patient was when @CAPS1 came. And I was getting hungry so I went inside and asked when is dinner @CAPS2? And @CAPS3 and hour.
23, "Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient."
21, "Who likes being patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off."
17, "A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost.  I showed patience by not yelling at them. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"
13, "One day when I was walking put side I found a snake on a rock. I yelled for my big brother who was playing his game. He said” hold on I need to beat the leavie “ but the snake was getting eratatid sot said,” now garrid its leaving finally after ten minutes he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me “why do you have a snake “I re plied “I saw it cool.” he liked I and let it go."
16, "I’m going to tell you a time when I was patient. a time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach. I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something."
18, "Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again."
9, Patience is when  you have problems and don’t complain. You need patience  at an amusment park to wait in all the lines. Patience is not complaining about being board on a long car ride. You need to be patience to  fish or to be rewarding and it can save others head aches. You want always be streesd if you are patient. So you should always be patient it can make your life so much easier long  lines wont seem so long  fishing is very rewarding for patince.
13, I don’t have a time when I’m patience so today I going to write about how impatience I am. I thank one day I was in a long line at the stare. (@ORGANIZATION1). I was a hot day and I was ready to go my cool and big house and relax and chillout. You all know how old people are they walk slow and talk to much. If you already notice. @NUM1 of those people where in front of me. He’s taking all the day taking out his wallet and talking to much. So I said “you know what I’ll jus go to another @ORGANIZATION1 and get me a slippery due rite know I can’t deall of this slowness or a humid day” and left.
9, I  am patient  every  even  this  year  for  @CAPS1 so  I can get  some  @CAPS2. I was buying  @CAPS2  but  I can’t buy  any more  because   @CAPS1 is  coming up  that  why I half to be  patient because it will seen longer  if  I keen getting excited.    Every day  is  patient sometimes I can’t wait to  get  out  of  school so  I can  play. I’m always trying to be patient because it’s one holiday after another each one gets more exiting.  Every kid tries but being patient is one of the most hard thing to do.  How I’m patient is I act like nopthing  exciting  is even comimg up.

23, "Today was the final day of tryouts. The deciding day .Tryouts we over I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didn’t know if could handle this. “@CAPS1 until you’ve left the building to open your envelope,” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS3’s only fair .If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out .Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building.” she called my name .I came up and grabbed my envelope .She dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .But, they didn’t make @CAPS3 .karma .I waited until I got outside.

19, "One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctor’s because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor’s office’s and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told it will only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some games. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said “how are you sweety”, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after the ???

The teacher said do you have, a page of a story that was due a month ago. @CAPS4 said “no” teacher asked “why” the kid said “because I have been going to a basketball tournament.” teacher said “you have tell tomorrow.” @CAPS2 the next day the kid is at @CAPS1 class @CAPS4 said “I’m @CAPS2 sorry I don’t have my paper.” teacher asked “why” “because my grampa died.” teacher said “okay tomorrow.” @CAPS2 the kid got his paper done."

20, "One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldn’t start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didn’t care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient."
16, One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.
6, "Patience is about whaiting and having what for staff you want like if I wont anything Patience is that you have to what before you get it. So patience, it means that you have to what in a good maner"
16, Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.
18, "It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now."
19, One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easly devoloped a nice windup and delivery but the arin angle was off. But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said “no!” @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On day’s that he’s unaccurate he doesn’t gave he keeps trying and doesn’t wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience.
24, Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @NUM3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
24, "Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
13, "One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don’t know what that is I’ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met."
20, "@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes."
14, "That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game."
20, Once upon a time there was a princess named @PERSON1 was a nice princess but one day she was hungry and did not feel like getting  her food so she told her made to but she was taking a shower so @PERSON1 had to wait and be patient she sat in her room for what had seemed like years to her she read a book watched @CAPS1.V and she went to see if her made was done she was not done and @PERSON1 was unpatient and got really mad and pounded on the door and said you better hang up or or and then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye and she realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and nobody was in there her made was now right behind  her in the hell she was emmbarassed and humiliated so she ran to her room and cried and that is the story of the time the princess was unpatient!
24, "Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volley ball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way."
17, "Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."
13, "Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”"
15, "My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors’ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen."
18, Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.
20, "On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe."
17, Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from @LOCATION2. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.
19, When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.
17, "Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience"
10, "My mom and I were were on are way to are house from sonco. We got stop by a trane, and it was going varey slow and my mom and I were waiting vary patiently but my mom, after  afew minutes wanted to ternanon but we stod  than and it was done."
19, "I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)"
12, "One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun."
24, "“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you."
17, "I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient."
10, I had to have patient's in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 we had to have patient in the @CAPS3. The @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 here slow we got ther a @TIME1 the we @CAPS5 it at @NUM1 we where in the @CAPS3. For hours and at a @CAPS7 pant's at the @CAPS3 I was @CAPS9 going to go @CAPS10 to the car and fall a sleep. But I used patient's to go trow that @CAPS3 and got the @CAPS11 scering of a @CAPS12 I had patients sowe I can Do something @CAPS13.
17, "I had patience when my dad din because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came and said that he went into a seizer and then a stroke. They @CAPS1-@CAPS2 him (mydad) and we waited about a good @NUM1 minutes and we used about @NUM2 boxes of tissues. The doctor said that ""we will keep him over night to observe him"" @CAPS3 the next day went to the hospital and after a white they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that store because I waited in the labb of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the @CAPS1-@CAPS5 and lastly when they said the need to pull the plug on him. @CAPS3 that's my story about when I had patience."
2, I show loyalty a lot of peolpe that I no and they show me loyalty.
24, "Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after……..for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages we’re left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."
22, "For this passage I am going to tell a story most patient person in the world. In the old testament long ago there was a man named @PERSON1@NUM1 was very rich, very happy and was loyal to god.

12, Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.
7, A time when I am patient. Is when I want something really bad. Like a phone or to get on the computer or something. But that is not  the only way to @CAPS1 patient you have too @CAPS1 patient in church and in the doctors office so there are many way to @CAPS1 patient
24, "Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack. The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient"
20, A story of being patient A kid wakes up. He goes upstairs to get a drink. He goes back down and watches cartoons. He becomes very excited. When he remembers he gets to go to a football game today. The @CAPS2 are playing @CAPS1. His dad comes downstairs and tells him to get ready for the game.  They drive about @NUM1 miles to the @CAPS2 stadium. They get there find their seats. The game starts. The @CAPS2 kickoff. The @CAPS2 stop them and by the end of the first half the @CAPS2 are down. ??? the score was @DATE1 to @NUM2. You can already see people leaving. Then comes the @DATE1. Now at the end of the @NUM3. the @CAPS2 are down??? More and more people leave. The @CAPS2 are coming back. We are still here. Now down by @NUM4 the @CAPS2 get another touch?? They are only down by three. @NUM5 seconds??? to give @PERSON1 culler throws a ??? pass to @LOCATION1 ??she. the crowd goes wild. We were patient enough to stay till the end of the game.
17, "Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, @CAPS1 was early in the @TIME1, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. Then we were on the rode again for @NUM5 hours. to go to @LOCATION1. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And that’s a time  when I was patient"
15, "On a morning @DATE1 when every one of my family members wake up at @NUM1 or @NUM2 o’clock am. Me my brother and my sisters told my mom “can @CAPS4 play the @CAPS1 and the labtop.’ @CAPS2 said sure but you guys have to wait until each other’s turn” and @CAPS4 said “ok.” @CAPS3 the @CAPS4 played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because I’m the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my town. Well until it was my turn @CAPS4 wood have to take playing the game on the things, @CAPS4 wold do that until the day was done. Or until tomoro was done. That wold be it until next @DATE2 or until @CAPS4 can play it again.  And that’s what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters."
16, "atime when I was patient was at my grandma’s house in @LOCATION1 my cousins and I had to wait for my grandma to get home @CAPS1 we can go to beach. After about an hour of waiting my cousin and; started to play video games to entertain ourselves @CAPS1 the time went faster my grandma had  probably worked for @NUM1 hours @CAPS1 at three- pm I decided to watch a movie I had been patient for the whole movie, at the middle of the movie my grandma got home @CAPS1 we all waited patiently till she was ready to  the beach.This was a time when I had been patient."
11, The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting and something and much more. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I’@CAPS1 the type who complain a lot and I don’t have patience. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life.
16, "My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave."
17, "We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do."
21, "One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient."
16, My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldn’t be able to be that patient without loseing  it.
7, Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.
15, "The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera my mom always promises me to get the film but sense her money was use on ??? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1 have crine up and this is what happened I ask my mom again can I get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money??? school supples. I was happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again.

8, "Do you have patients? I have very? Patient.I???will for anything for long. Where you have patient you have to wait on what you wait, or need."
12, "There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said “@CAPS1 not tonight,” because it was a school night. So I said “okay I know it’s a school night,” @CAPS2 at least I said it with maners and loyalty! and thats a time I when I was loyalty to someone and here is a time when I stuck up for someone, well my bestfriend was in a fight with this other girl and it was in person and I went right up to my @CAPS3 friends “enimey” and said why don’t you just go home and leave my friend alone and she backtalked me then finally we started ignoring her then she left, that’s a time when a stuck up for my bestfriend while she was in a fight.”"
8, My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you.

21, "My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars."

19, "One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient."
21, "Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!"
17, When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient.
14, "What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient."
9, I know person that’s way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you’ll ever meet. I am not patient at all.First of all when were going somewhere my sister would just sit there. I would say can we leave now.My sister is always patient! That’s why I think she’s patient.
19, "At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!"

She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""@CAPS2 can't I fly yet"" and momma said,"" @CAPS1 be patient."""
17, "I was @CAPS1 excited to get my first ipad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient."

Hours later of trying to keep him warm @PERSON4 arrived. They got @PERSON3 on a talk. And started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while @CAPS11 eventuly got belter. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1."
12, "I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life."
15, "I have been patiencent a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! Thats alot of patience just for one ticket its @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It’s hard being patience it exspecially when your are going to meet a celebirtly that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patiencent a lot during this process of saving up money. No matter how hard its going to be I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patiencent and still are. I meant could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well it’s not that easy first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money that really sets you back. But like said no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life."
20, "It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."
13, A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called x-men @CAPS3 wolver in and my mom said I had to what until @CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me @CAPS3 and played it all day long
11, "The time when I was patient I was about @NUM1 because I was in @NUM2 grade im @NUM3 now but back to what I was sayin, I was sayin that I was seven in the @NUM2 grade and I was standing in the lunch line and these kids just kept on cuttin me in line jus for some lunch and I just sat there, being patient and myself. but I just stood there so when we did something else I was patient when we got up there I was ok it was ok ‘cause I still got to eat."
18, "Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that??? has to be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time."
17, "Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening."
16, "At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient."
13, In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.
16, "One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!"
10, "Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet."
15, "When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly she didn’t find the blanket.I have to be patient. I had  and it wasn’t done, then ???. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago ???. She ??? found a time to ??? that she ??? find ??? in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is fiished but I’m not. I s ??? I can be patient for alittle while???"
16, "One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample."
21, "We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting the to ride the skyline. After we ate, me my cousins and my??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole??? of cedar point. “im so excited” said one of my sisters. “yaa me too!” said the the other. We were walking towards it. It took really long. When we saw the line we heaked! “this will take so long” said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? ???. “wow it look really high” said my cousin. “@CAPS2’t, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. She’ll take care of us” said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us. Wanting to go on so badly. “why @CAPS2’t you go ahead” said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again!"
15, "Patience is a hard thing to have, but there is rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”"
18, "Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting."
19, "When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day."
24, "Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"
18, "A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing. Sometimes when @CAPS6 in a bad mood I have @CAPS9 be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away. I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed. “@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 go get ice-cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!” @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob –goblen get off my bed OR @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU @CAPS9 A @CAPS10!!! I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying is sound so sill and stuped. Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little (fore years old) and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t fell good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was n’t patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the “beginning” but at the end I was."
17, "The time I was patient was whene I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient."
17, "One sunny beutful day I went out and was driving my glad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and she said I couldn’t go @CAPS5 I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I was playing far two hours strait, and then I decided to go watch @CAPS6 assassain  (@CAPS7) . After that was com I went back to play in playstation @NUM1(p.s.@NUM1.), again. played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @CAPS5 I look out the window, and it was my .  @CAPS1 ma. Then we talked bout the new qlad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my . my .  new @CAPS8!. Then I ran out took it out and roud it for like @NUM3 hours strait. That is how I had patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new @CAPS8."
10, "This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me."
16, "Patience, whats the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that’s the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It’s hard enough to be quite. But it’s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That’s the story when I had to be patient."
18, "??? ??? ??? was about the mid of @DATE1 my family and I were going to ??? @LOCATION1. ???/ mid @LOCATION1. I was so excited  I ??? the days ??? with all of my ??? (part no legible) and accessories. I was pumped of ??? my mom and my brother pack the morning at the ??? my dad and I were all set. We packed everything in our old,??? can @NUM1 we headed off.

I was still ??? because ??? wher in mid @LOCATION1 and ??? get to ??? and have an awesome time together. That was my story about the time I had to be patient."
15, "There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient."
15, "To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. “@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort."
12, Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.
20, "Today was the first day I was patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again."
8, "Everyday at school I have to be patience to get my food like pizza,saled,sand with milk what is bad all the time but i check my milk. I had to be patientce to get my gun to."
18, "I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one."
13, "Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patiencet is when I want I get on the computer. I Was also patiencet for getting my second class rank, well thats all I have to say about patience."
21, "I have exprienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didn’t sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed."
17, "Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!"
17, "A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”"
14, "I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do. AS the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth. The grass was also as dry as cactus, but the day moved on. Finally when we went are own way. We knew we had patience."
13, "One day in the @CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only @NUM1 docters and this lady took so long. So it was my turn to go in but I was scar that if hurts but then he was doing and it didn’t hurt for nothing. And then I went home."
12, My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.
18, "I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat."

Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach your mind has to be patient when you wish you do things but you really can`t. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have."

But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the trooper for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time.

Eventually he did came back. That was a hard time, but it was patient and got thought it."

And this line was really long. @CAPS1 was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and @CAPS1 was getting ??. This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “@CAPS3,shut up,man. I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining? “exclaimed @CAPS1. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line . After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line. Then something bad happened. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the @NUM4 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his ipod @CAPS5!"

13, "There are many times I was patient, but this one was not to long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I just sat there finished, just read and drawed. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn’t complain I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably worst time when I want to talk but couldn’t."

16, "Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza is supposed to hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tanruns. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tanrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast.  Always be patient."
21, "Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!"

18, "A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time I was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner. It was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more."
22, "On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did."
19, "Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."
24, "“@CAPS1!” @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a wail. “You can’t do this to me. I’m ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you."
13, "Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient,he waited @NUM1  months for the xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game.But one day after school it arrived."
15, "Patient people are the people that tolerate life. If you’re not patient you won’t get through to welI.I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’@CAPS4 why patient is important"
16, In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way is airport and there was?? trying to work through traffic but we could not. So my mom starting yelling and l told her just calm down we will make it. So finally we got to the airport and there were a lot of people so we had to rush finally we made it to airport and l taught my mom to be patient and you will get were your going. So finally we made it to @LOCATION1.
