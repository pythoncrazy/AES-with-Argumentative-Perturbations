That ' s costly ! 	0
Fees result in longer durations of studies . 	0
Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone . 	0
Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany . 	1
Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion . 	1
For in this way , Sunday shopping days would be better spread out through the year . 	0
Also streets and shops would presumably be emptier as not everyone would be open on the same day . 	0
However then you ' d have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day . 	0
Courts are also subject to human error . 	0
No human being or human committee should again be given the permission to rule over ' life or death ' . 	0
Every human , even those who have committed a despicable crime , can bring themselves to regret and change their opinion . 	0
That ' s why Germany should not introduce capital punishment ! 	1
A door must remain open for making amends . 	0
Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee , and others , such as “ Musikantenstadl ” and soap operas , are only interesting to certain audiences . 	0
Nevertheless , everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure , for we need general and independent media . 	1
After all we want to get our view of the world neither through the lens of the government nor through that of rich media entrepreneurs . 	0
Their tools , data and expertise have been used to keep us under surveillance for a long time . 	0
Having said that , state funds are often wasted on nonsensical investments , so that this ideal appears unworthy of support in many ways . 	0
Besides , the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain . 	0
It is desirable that no one channels his or her wealth past the tax authorities . 	0
Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible . 	0
Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state . 	1
Despite the severe clashes in Kiev , which at times have threatened to escalate , the EU should not intervene in local politics . 	1
Although Ukraine is a European country , and the Ukrainian opposition is primarily interested in installing a robust democracy , possible supporters face a considerably stronger opponent in the intervention of Russia in local politics . 	0
It doesn ' t matter after all that those who administer the treatment don ' t have ' doctor status ' . 	0
Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment , since there is a chance of recovery . 	0
Alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments , since both methods can lead to the prevention , mitigation or cure of an illness . 	1
Since however skat , chess etc . are not accepted as Olympic events , computer games should also not be recognized as Olympic events . 	1
Our society is strongly digitized and influenced by computers . 	0
Yet sports are usually associated with physical training . 	0
Olympic events are rooted in old traditions . 	0
On the other hand , the events have a culturally determined character . 	0
The statutory health insurance companies should also cover treatments with non-medical and alternative practitioners . 	1
Their treatment methods and successes are not amply researched or proven . 	0
Yet many patients subjectively experience relief or are cured of their complaints , which ultimately also saves costs for conventional treatments and medication . 	0
Also conventional medicine is in many cases not successful , and , moreover , entails significant risks and side effects . 	0
To oblige non-academics to finance others ' degrees through taxes , however , is not just . 	0
As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly , one can continue to regard this as social justice . 	0
Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees . 	1
It ' s always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship . 	0
Those who study later decide this early on , anyway . 	0
Granted , those concern primarily the British and American intelligence services , but the German services evidently do collaborate with them closely . 	0
Intelligence services must urgently be regulated more tightly by parliament ; this should be clear to everyone after the disclosures of Edward Snowden . 	1
' Property entails commitment ' is one of the tenets of our social order . 	0
Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property . 	0
A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone , however , will lead to a further division of society . 	0
The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods . 	0
A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society . 	1
