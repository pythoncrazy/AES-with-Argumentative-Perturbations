There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements . 	1
Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt , the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it . 	0
Besides , the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement , which is disproportionate . 	0
Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste , but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense . 	0
It is an asset for the economy . 	0
The negative impact of air traffic however is considerable . 	0
Air traffic is extremely environmentally unfriendly . 	0
For those people the late opening hours , which meanwhile already extend to 12 : 00 midnight , present a good alternative . 	0
As a central airport Berlin Tegel is particularly attractive for business travellers and should by all means remain operational . 	1
Particularly in Tegel , the residents have been bearing the stress of aircraft noise for decades . 	0
If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing , then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction . 	1
Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners , especially in spring and summer . 	0
Since the area belongs to the federal state , or the federation , it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents . 	0
For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin , so that using Tempelhofer Feld , which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed , as living space is a sensible idea . 	0
I find the peripheral housing development at Tempelhofer Feld right for urban planning reasons , as the area is right in the middle of the city ( capital ) . 	1
The size of the field allows for both housing and generous open space . 	0
People , however , who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem : everyone else can shop weekdays , but they can ' t . 	0
Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays . 	1
Likewise public holidays should remain what they are : for some a day of introspection , for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper . 	0
Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work . 	0
Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments . 	1
Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials , yet it ' s precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional ' western ' medical therapies that ' s been demonstrated as beneficial . 	0
Besides many general practitioners offer such counselling and treatments in parallel anyway - and who would want to question their broad expertise ? 	0
Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family , otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc . Furthermore , there ' s no need to keep shops open on Sundays . 	0
For you can go shopping 6 days a week , as shops are open till 10pm on some days . 	0
It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest . 	1
Besides you ' re not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment . 	0
One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up . 	0
Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements , although there aren ' t enough bins and bag-dispensers for dog dirt . 	1
The city , especially the green spaces , should be kept tidy after all , for they are there for our recreation . 	0
A higher fine , so dog owners would have to dig deeper into their pockets , is supposed to be a deterrent after all . 	0
One could worry that our farmers would then run into economic difficulties . 	0
We should thus all limit our consumption of meat rigorously . 	1
Furthermore , the production of meat is comparably resource-intensive . 	0
Excessive consumption of meat is unhealthy . 	0
However , no serious economist has confirmed this prediction to date . 	0
No , the retirement age should be raised to 65 again . 	1
People are getting older on average , but they are not sicker and not duller because of it . 	0
Without them we ' d forgo a great deal of collected experience . 	0
And we ' d have to offer more leisure activities for seniors . 	0
Capital punishment is not a solution , as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes . 	0
Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons , though . 	0
After all there are criminals who enjoy ' living ' in prison for its decent board , no taxes to be paid , no stress with work . 	0
Still , the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes . 	1
