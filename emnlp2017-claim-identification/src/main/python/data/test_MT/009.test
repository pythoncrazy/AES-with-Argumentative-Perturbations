US series are preferred over “ Tatort ” , and online magazines are turned to instead of the “ Tagesthemen ” . 	0
The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism . 	0
Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence . 	1
Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters . 	0
But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds , the fee quite rightly annoys them . 	0
Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins . 	0
Yes , it ' s annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time . 	0
We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation ! 	1
But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt . 	0
The steering system may still need a bit of tweaking , as the car jack-knifes at higher speeds , and surely you ' ll want to be speeding a lot with that beauty . 	0
Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease . 	0
All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease . 	0
These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors ( housing health and employment ) . 	0
After the new BER Airport has been commissioned , Tegel should definitely be closed . 	1
Also , Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry , and for housing . 	0
Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path . 	0
I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades . 	0
For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong . 	0
The prototype of Audi ' s new sports car has car lovers raving . 	1
But aside from that the car caters to pretty much every wish . 	0
This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society , which may reduce discrimination of financially and / or socially disadvantaged children . 	0
School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again . 	1
Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one ' s individuality but what ' s really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community , which would possibly be strengthened by an equal , collective appearance . 	0
Furthermore , it would facilitate the finding of truants , who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school . 	0
Always having to visit the doctor first ( including travel and waiting time , possible embarrassment , etc . ) leads to more unwanted pregnancies . 	0
Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor ' s and many women take it unnecessarily . 	0
Being a pharmacist myself , I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies . 	1
From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse . 	0
However , the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors . 	0
But for snap shots that ' s still enough . 	0
I can only recommend the new smartphone XYZ-123 to everyone . 	1
Of course the camera could be better , as it only has mediocre resolution and images in dark surroundings are often snowy . 	0
Rent prices should be limited by a cap when there ' s a change of tenant . 	1
Landlords may want to earn as much as possible , and many , consistent with market principles , are prepared to pay higher rents , but that people with the same income suddenly must pay more and can ' t live in the same flat anymore seems implausible . 	0
Gentrification destroys entire districts and their culture . 	0
But as long as it is unclear as to how this works , the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty . 	0
It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents . 	1
But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease . 	0
The patient could learn to be more aware of his or her body and to treat it more healthily . 	0
This will do little damage to the pharmaceutical industry , and conventional medicine will also hardly suffer . 	0
A reduction in the amount of chemically produced medication per person is most certainly desirable . 	1
From time immemorial humans have had complementary medicine , and it has not generally been ineffective . 	0
Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments . 	0
Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases . 	0
Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven . 	1
