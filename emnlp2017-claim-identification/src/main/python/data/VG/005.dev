The notion that there is a media vendetta to prove that black people are inherently corrupt is fallacious . 	0

Therefore , the God of the Bible does not exist . 	1

With regard to the second premise , it is far from obvious that the Bible teaches eternal punishment for minor sins . 	0
Also , we do not know what the effect of modern medicine on their culture will be . 	0

Why should we assume that modern medicine would cure them ? 	0
Perhaps they do not wish or need to be cured . 	0
Rather , what separates us from God forever is the sin of freely rejecting God out of our lives . 	0
This is a sin of infinite gravity and proportion , since it is the creature ' s free decision to reject God Himself . 	0
Admittedly , Dr . Curley ' s Calvinism has no room for this sort of sin . 	0
But on a biblical view , it is not so much God , as creatures themselves , who determine their eternal destiny . 	0

Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

According to reliable sources who spoke to Human Rights Watch , doctors from several humanitarian organizations who were in the theater ' s immediate vicinity sought access to the released hostages but were denied by security officials . 	0
When doctors finally did see the hostages , in ambulances or hospitals , medical personnel were unable to prescribe appropriate treatment , as officials had not informed them of the substance that was used . 	0
Footage indicated that no doctors were available outside the theater at that time . 	0
Russian authorities continue to withhold vital information about the gas , even though it is of key importance to medical doctors who are still treating hostages-some of whom are still in grave condition-and to survivors , who may face long-term health consequences . 	0
Increasing evidence suggests that many hostages died because they were not given basic medical care immediately after their rescue . 	1
