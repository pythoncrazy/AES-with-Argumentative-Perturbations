In a partnership action , especially where the partnership agreement was oral rather than by deed , it is not uncommon for issues to arise on the taking of the accounts in the course of winding up and for those issues to be directed to be tried in order to determine the legal and factual basis on which the accounts should be taken . 	0

This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1

To evaluate that response , I need to know whether natural selection really has the fantastic creative power attributed to it . 	0

The continuing survival of Darwinist orthodoxy illustrates Thomas Kuhn ' s famous point that the accumulation of anomalies never in itself falsifies a paradigm , because " To reject one paradigm without substituting another is to reject science itself . " [ 5 ] This practice may be appropriate as a way of carrying on the professional enterprise called science , but it can be grossly misleading when it is imposed upon persons who are asking questions other than the ones scientific naturalists want to ask . 	0
All I want them to do is to be candid about the disconfirming evidence and admit , if it is the case , that they are hanging on to Darwinism only because they prefer a shaky theory to having no theory at all . 	1
