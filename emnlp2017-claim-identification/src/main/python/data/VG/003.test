But neither can it be explained from the side of Jewish influences because the Jewish concept of resurrection was radically different than Jesus ' resurrection . 	0

The simplest Christian who has neither the oppurtunity nor wherewithal to conduct an historical investigation of Jesus ' resurrection can know with assurance that Jesus has risen simply because God ' s spirit bears unmistakable witness to Him that this is so . 	0
This means that no one is justified in rejecting the Christian faith simply because the evidence isn ' t good enough . 	0
If were no historical resurrection , then there then today there would be no encounter with the risen Lord and no witness of the Spirit . 	0
From the fact that there is such an encounter and witness , it follows logically that there was historical resurrection , even if in certain situations historical evidence concerning the resurrection , which is available at that time and place , is slim , ambiguous , or even deleterious .
