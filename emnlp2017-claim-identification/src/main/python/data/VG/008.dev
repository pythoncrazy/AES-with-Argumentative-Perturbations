Multiple Wits sources of varied ideological and other hues say that signs emerged very early in Reid Birley ' s tenure that she was extraordinarily difficult to work with and that the unanimous initial goodwill towards her steadily dissipated among those who had to interact with her daily . 	0
We report this week that senior Wits academics , whom we name with their permission and whose own transformation and gender credentials are impeccable , despairingly recount that Reid Birley repeatedly rejected long-term attempts at constructive intervention . 	0
It is also a matter of record that two very senior managers , recruited from an historically disadvantaged university and who can scarcely be said to be anti-transformation reactionaries , have distanced themselves from Reid Birley . 	0
With such considerations in mind , it is difficult to understand Reid Birley ' s claims that allegations against her are without substance . 	1

We made that commitment because when we consulted on our call for action , which we published in December last year , one of the messages that came back very strongly was that people did not think that the world or , indeed , the UK were doing enough for orphans and vulnerable children , and we reflected that in the strategy that we published in July . 	0

No health-care system can hope to be perfectly egalitarian , but patient power should drive up standards for everyone ; keeping power in the hands of doctors and bureaucrats , on the other hand , will keep standards low while being just as unequal . 	1
Of course , giving more power to patients will mean giving the most power to articulate , well-informed and pushy patients , who tend to be better-off . 	0
Nor is it safe to assume that , because the poor are less well - informed , it is in their interest that all the important decisions about their care should be made for them . 	0
For example , the late J . L . Mackie of Oxford University , one of the most influential atheists of our time , admitted , " If . . . there are . . . objective values , they make the existence of a god more probable than it would have been without them . 	0
Thus we have a . . . defensible . . . argument from morality to the existence of a god . { 12 } But in order to deny God ' s existence , Mackie therefore denied that objective values exist . 	0
If God does not exist , then objective moral values do not exist . 	1

It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0
Naturalistic philosophy has worked out a strategy to prevent this problem from arising : it labels naturalism as science and theism as religion . 	0
The former is then classified as knowledge , and the latter as mere belief . 	0
The distinction is of critical importance , because only knowledge can be objectively valid for everyone ; belief is valid only for the believer , and should never be passed off as knowledge . 	0
The student who thinks that 2 and 2 make 5 , or that water is not made up of hydrogen and oxygen , or that the theory of evolution is not true , is not expressing a minority viewpoint . 	0
He or she is ignorant , and the job of education is to cure that ignorance and to replace it with knowledge . 	0
Students in the public schools are thus to be taught at an early age that " evolution is a fact , " and as time goes by they will gradually learn that evolution means naturalism . 	1
