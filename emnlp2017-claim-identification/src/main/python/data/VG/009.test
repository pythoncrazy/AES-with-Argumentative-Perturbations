The Bible teaches that God gives justifying faith to those He arbitrarily chooses and excludes others . 	0
I think that a quick look at the evening news any night would show you this is not the case . 	0
For all these facts , we should be led to believe that there ' s basically no suffering in the world , or that there ' s very , very , very little . 	0
We think individuals around here are good because they want to minimize suffering in the world , among other reasons , and if we apply the same standard to God , we assume this is true of God , too . 	0
What my first argument draws attention to is that given God ' s , given God ' s omnibenevolence , God should desire to have a world in which there is as little suffering as possible , perhaps none . [ 8 ] Okay , this should be a desire of any good person , and we think that goodness will generalize . 	0
One quick aside , I ' m going to refer to God as " He , " more or less out of deference to tradition . 	0
So assume that since God is infinitely good , He desires to minimize suffering in this world . 	0
I also do it swallowing kind of hard implicit sexism , but please bear with me over that . 	0
I don ' t want to suggest that God has a gender , because that ' s not part of standard Christian doctrine . 	0
And lastly , God is omnipotent , so any design that God brings into being , God can actually implement . 	0
Secondly , God is omniscient , so God ' s supposed to figure out how to design a world that has basically no harm at all . [ 9 ] If you ' re omniscient , you ' re really smart , and you can figure these things out . 	0

This is often called a cosmological argument , or an argument from first cause . 	0
I want to look at Dr . Craig ' s argument about the cause of the universe . 	0
And you have to bear with me , I ' m not used to doing this , I have to read a little bit more than I would like . 	0
Now I want to move on to discuss the arguments , Dr . Craig ' s arguments . 	0
We rapidly draw the conclusion that this universe had a cause . 	0
The second premise is everything that exists must have had a cause . 	0
In fact the universe had a beginning is the first premise . 	0
In short , the argument is that God must exist because the universe had a beginning . 	1
That ' s the nature of this argument . 	0
Dr . Craig identified this cause as God . 	0
Nowhere does the New Testament teach that justifying faith is arbitrarily bestowed by God . 	0
Rather , justification by faith is the wonderful doctrine that God ' s forgiveness and salvation is a free gift that you can ' t do anything to merit . 	0
Here Dr . Curley ' s argument seems to go like this : 1 . 	0

Now in this argument I think that both of those premises are false . 	0

Therefore , the God of the Bible does not exist . 	1
But time only allows me to deal with the second . 	0
With regard to the second premise , it is far from obvious that the Bible teaches eternal punishment for minor sins . 	0

So far as I am able tell , this thesis is no longer defended . " { 2 } Similarly , William Alston , a prominent philosopher , says , " It is now acknowledged on ( almost ) all sides that the logical argument [ from evil ] is bankrupt . " { 3 } So I don ' t think anyone has been able to show a logical incompatibility between God and harm . 	1
Peter Van Inwagen of the University of Syracuse reports in the Philosophical Perspectives of 1991 , " It used to be widely held that evil was incompatible with the existence of God : that no possible world contained both God and evil . 	0
And in fact this is very widely recognized by philosophers today . 	0
Even supportive friends can find themselves shut out . 	0
When drugs take over as a priority , the user becomes increasingly isolated from those around them - partners , siblings , parents , employers . 	0
The resulting social isolation often triggers more drug use . 	0
Drug buddies are always there , but it becomes very difficult to maintain relationships outside the drug culture . 	0
People use drugs to block out painful underlying problems , and those problems won ' t dissolve after a mandatory drying-out period . 	0
Has Watters considered what would happen once they were released ? 	0
Families of drug addicts know that addiction chips away at healthy relationships . 	0
The newly " clean " addict may also feel violated , traumatised and betrayed by their detention : an excellent emotional recipe for getting straight back on the gear again . 	0
However much they want to help , if your loved ones have conspired to have you thrown in the slammer against your will - and many addicts will see it that way - you ' re hardly going to pop round to their place for a cuppa and a chat when you get out . 	0
But forcibly locking up addicts could do further serious harm to these relationships . 	0
Rather , what separates us from God forever is the sin of freely rejecting God out of our lives . 	0
This is a sin of infinite gravity and proportion , since it is the creature ' s free decision to reject God Himself . 	0
Admittedly , Dr . Curley ' s Calvinism has no room for this sort of sin . 	0
But on a biblical view , it is not so much God , as creatures themselves , who determine their eternal destiny . 	0

Copies of the comments of the Ministers have already been made available to Dr . Raghuvansh Prasad Singh . 	0
I have accordingly disallowed the notice of question of privilege . 	1
In order to constitute a breach of privilege or contempt of the House , it has to be proved that the statement was not only wrong or misleading but it was made deliberately to mislead the House . 	0
It is well established that if any statement is made on the floor of the House by a Member or Minister which another Member believes to be untrue , incomplete or incorrect , it does not constitute a breach of privilege . 	0
On a perusal of the comments of the Ministers in the matter , I am satisfied that there has been no misleading of the House by them as alleged by the Member . 	0
A breach of privilege can arise only when the Member or the Minister makes a false statement or an incorrect statement wilfully , deliberately and knowingly . 	0

This realisation is an internal one : the decision to quit drugs cannot be enforced from the outside . 	0
