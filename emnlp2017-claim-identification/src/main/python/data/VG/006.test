How much more probable ? 	0
We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life - permitting universes like ours . 	0
God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe . { 8 } During the last thirty years , scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicately balanced set of initial conditions simply given in the Big Bang itself . 	1
Donald Page , one of America ' s eminent cosmologists , has calculated the odds of our universe existing as on the order of one chance out of 1010 ( 123 ) , a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement ! { 9 } Robert Jastrow , the head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God " ever to come out of science . " { 10 } Once again , the view that Christian theists have always held , that there is an intelligent designer of the Cosmos , seems to me to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation of chance . 	0
Now with those numbers in mind , consider the following . 	0
The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is about1080 . 	0
The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 1018 , that ' s ten followed by eighteen zeros . 	0
