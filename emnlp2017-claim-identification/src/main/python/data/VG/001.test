In a speech that appears to have been timed for the upcoming elections , President Bush attacked the Senate this week for having a " lousy record " of confirming his judicial nominees . 	1
The facts do not bear this out . 	0

Watching him once on a mobile phone to Mr Blair , striding up and down and wagging his finger , I felt I was hallucinating : surely here was the Prime Minister issuing orders to an official rather than the other way round ? 	0
He has called him " a prat " in front of one witness , has told him to " get a f----- - move on " when he believes a meeting has gone on too long , and instructed him to drop what he is doing and concentrate on something else " because it can ' t f----- - wait " . 	0

God is said to be timeless , and the only timeless things around are abstract objects . 	0

This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0

It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

The author , Zheng Yu , writes , " Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult " for Russia to be part of the West . 	0
The process of catching up for Russia has lasted " several hundred years , since Peter the Great , [ and ] has not made Russia entirely Westernized . " 	0

I would still be rational on the basis of my experience to believe in the resurrection , even if I didn ' t have the chance to look at the evidence for it . 	0
Let me give you an analogy . { 7 } Suppose you are accused of a crime that you know you didn ' t commit , and all the evidence stands against you . 	0
