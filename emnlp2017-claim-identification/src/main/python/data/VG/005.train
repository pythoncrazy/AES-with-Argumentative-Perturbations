In the balance are not only the dead and mutilated of Iraq ( and who knows how many from the invading force ) , but the very real possibility that such an act of pre-emptive world-destabilising aggression could spin out of control and lead to other despots pre-emptively arming themselves with all manner of apocalyptic weapons and , perhaps , to Armageddon . 	0

Given human freedom , God cannot guarantee how people are going to use that freedom . 	0

What my first argument draws attention to is that given God ' s , given God ' s omnibenevolence , God should desire to have a world in which there is as little suffering as possible , perhaps none .

This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0
We believe it is a tragedy of history that in the Middle East - - which gave the world great gifts of law and science and faith - - so many have been held back by lawless tyranny and fanaticism . 	0

Those of us who work in the Health Service see every day the tragic consequences of exposure to the powerful carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke . 	0

If no minister is responsible for all that went wrong in our capital markets over the first eighteen months of this government ' s rule ( October 1999 to March 2001 , the period of the scam as defined by the JPC ) does it mean the liberalisation of the economy has liberated ministers from their responsibility to the country through Parliament ? 	0

Our first and most sweeping point - - QUESTION : But may I just point out on 3a , it - - the quote --you left out the first clause I think . 	0

It was an opportunity we felt we should seize , because for the first time we were seeing the removal of settlements and not the addition of settlements . 	0
And then at the Ninth Circuit level , on page 3a of the petition , the language is that Dastar copied , et cetera , and marketed it without attribution to Fox . 	0
Neither court , Justice Ginsburg , examined Dastar ' s credits , affirmative credits , for accuracy , for whether they registered with the consumers , for misleadingness or falsity in any way . 	0
I would suggest that the record indeed is that it was the omission of credits for their competitors that was , in fact , the basis for the double award . 	0
QUESTION : This is a failure --this is a failure to attribute case then ? 	0
QUESTION : Can we go back to your statement ? 	0
As I --as I understood it , it wasn ' t the omission of Fox , but the addition of your people . 	0
In other words , it wasn ' t the failure to give credit to respondents , but it was petitioner ' s taking credit for it that was what the lower courts thought was wrong . 	1

Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

We can know that Jesus rose from the dead , wholly apart from a consideration of historical evidence . 	0
We can know Jesus rose because Jesus is alive today and by God ' s spirit He is an living reality to those who follow him . 	0
The simplest Christian who has neither the oppurtunity nor wherewithal to conduct an historical investigation of Jesus ' resurrection can know with assurance that Jesus has risen simply because God ' s spirit bears unmistakable witness to Him that this is so . 	0
This means that no one is justified in rejecting the Christian faith simply because the evidence isn ' t good enough . 	0
If were no historical resurrection , then there then today there would be no encounter with the risen Lord and no witness of the Spirit . 	0
From the fact that there is such an encounter and witness , it follows logically that there was historical resurrection , even if in certain situations historical evidence concerning the resurrection , which is available at that time and place , is slim , ambiguous , or even deleterious .

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1

It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

I have accordingly disallowed the notice of question of privilege . 	1
In order to constitute a breach of privilege or contempt of the House , it has to be proved that the statement was not only wrong or misleading but it was made deliberately to mislead the House . 	0
It is well established that if any statement is made on the floor of the House by a Member or Minister which another Member believes to be untrue , incomplete or incorrect , it does not constitute a breach of privilege . 	0
On a perusal of the comments of the Ministers in the matter , I am satisfied that there has been no misleading of the House by them as alleged by the Member . 	0

It increasingly requires education of national and foreign judges to explain the jurisprudence and context for prosecution . 	0
I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

Well , before I give you an estimation , let me just give you some numbers to give you a feel for the odds . 	0
How much more probable ? 	0
We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life - permitting universes like ours . 	0
God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe . { 8 } During the last thirty years , scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicately balanced set of initial conditions simply given in the Big Bang itself . 	1
Donald Page , one of America ' s eminent cosmologists , has calculated the odds of our universe existing as on the order of one chance out of 1010 ( 123 ) , a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement ! { 9 } Robert Jastrow , the head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God " ever to come out of science . " { 10 } Once again , the view that Christian theists have always held , that there is an intelligent designer of the Cosmos , seems to me to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation of chance . 	0
Now with those numbers in mind , consider the following . 	0
The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is about1080 . 	0
The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 1018 , that ' s ten followed by eighteen zeros . 	0

The author , Zheng Yu , writes , " Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult " for Russia to be part of the West . 	0
