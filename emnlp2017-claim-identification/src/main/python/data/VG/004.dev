It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

But if there is , we ' ve no reason to believe it ' s omniscient , no reason to believe it ' s omnibenevolent , and no reason to believe that it ' s omnipotent . 	0
From the fact that the universe was created , all we have some reason to believe is that it is slightly more powerful than its effects . 	0
What Professor Craig has given us is that there is some sort of cosmological sparkplug . 	0
Maybe there is . 	0
So we don ' t have any reason to conclude this thing is infinite . 	0
It may be strong but finite . 	0
So maybe it ' s a little stronger or more poweful than the nature of the universe as it exists . 	0
But the universe is finite , as Dr . Craig has argued . 	0

The Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 80 judges in its first 15 months in power - more than the Republican-led Senate confirmed in its final 30 months in control , from 1999 through the summer of 2001 . 	0
The facts do not bear this out . 	0
In a speech that appears to have been timed for the upcoming elections , President Bush attacked the Senate this week for having a " lousy record " of confirming his judicial nominees . 	1

I want to thank Dr . Curley for his very personal and sensitive remarks . 	0
In this speech , I hope to show , however , that most of his objections are aimed at a false target , at a conception of God which I , as a Christian , reject . 	0
What Dr . Curley offers is really seven deadly objections to the Calvinistic God , not the Christian God . 	0
It is only by equating Calvinism with Christianity that his objections have any force . 	1
Be seen to care about the mess they have created . 	0
Secure the borders , round up the criminals , curfews , road blocks and checkpoints , and properly train and equip the new Iraqi army and police force . 	0
Tony Blair and George Bush and the rest of the allied countries must inject massive resources and personnel immediately to deal with this . 	1
The apparent current policy of waiting and seeing must change . 	1
The focus should be on the overall picture ( of mayhem and murder ) rather than on one event ( a kidnapping ) . 	0
The borders are wide open to infiltrators , the country is awash with weapons of all types , and the streets are swarming with criminals and ex-Saddam loyalists . 	0
I put the blame completely on the US and British troops for not having a proper plan for the " morning after " the invasion , and the chaos that ensued . 	0
Very little coverage given to those Iraqis kidnapped for ransom or revenge . 	0
Iraqis are as much victims of these crimes as the foreigners who are trying to help Iraqis in reconstruction and humanitarian work . 	0
As an Iraqi , I feel disgust and shame that such atrocities are carried out in my country . 	0
We succeeded because America has an enormous capacity to do good ; an enormous capacity to learn from its mistakes , and to move on . 	1
In a way , then the world bank is loaning Brazil money which will ultimately result in environmental destruction in the name of environmental and economic progress http://www.theenvironmentsite.org/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=436 	1

There ' s this explosion of gasoline igniting . 	0
You can think of the ignition of the gasoline as somewhat of a big bang . 	0
[ holds up a sparkplug ] Every morning , I , a lot of you , get up and we go to our car , and we put the key in the ignition , turn it over , and the car starts up . 	0
Let me give you a quick analogy here , okay . 	0
We have no reason to believe this thing has any of the properties that God has . 	0
But , even if you grant this conclusion , you have no reason to believe this is God . 	0
Although I think there may be reasons to question them , I ' m going to grant them right away . [ 10 ] I ' m going to grant the immediate conclusion , that there was a cause to the universe . 	0
I want to say right off that I ' m going to grant both of Dr . Craig ' s premises , that the universe had a beginning , and that every event has a cause . 	0
The sparkplug . [ 11 ] It ' s a spark off this sparkplug , which causes the gasoline to ignite , that causes the small big bang that gets you to school every day . 	0
What ' s the cause of the gasoline igniting ? 	0

So , if you put that into the equation , I think it makes it clear that it is not necessarily true that an all-good God would have to create a world in which there is no harm . 	1

Of course it ' s also possible , as the Christian believes , that there ' s an afterlife , in which God will compensate us for the harms that we have borne if we have borne these in courage , faith , and trust in Him . 	0
Every immoral act will be punished . 	0
Though acts of terrorism meant to intimidate the judiciary are not uncommon in India , the Jakarta blast , which was directed at the American-owned Marriot Hotel , does not appear to have been meant to warn the Indonesian judiciary . 	1
Was the blast meant to intimidate the judges trying the cases arising from the Bali explosion not to pronounce a guilty verdict . 	0
It would be difficult to say . 	0
Was the timing intended ? 	0
If they had wanted to convey a warning to the judiciary , they would have chosen as their target a building associated with the judiciary or at least the government . 	0
