Numbers are abstract objects . 	0
The second argument I want to give against God ' s existence draws attention to the fact that the definition of God in classical Christianity is , I think , contradictory . 	0
As far I know , it ' s common to think of God as an abstract object , the kind of abstract object that Professor Craig talked about . 	0
God is said to be timeless , and the only timeless things around are abstract objects . 	0
At the same time , it ' s believed that God is causally efficacious , that is that God can affect material objects . 	0
God brought the universe into existence , we ' re told , and God can influence the events of the world on a day-to-day , hour-to-hour , and second-to-second basis . 	0
The problems is that abstracts objects , as standardly understood , have no causal properties . 	0

They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	1
But , what is different between Muhammad and other perported figures who claimed Divine Revelation , were those who were closest to him . 	0

Certainly these characteristics were unusual in a man surrounded by a society indulged in all forms of idolatry and immorality . 	0
During his youth , Muhammad never once touched wine , nor engaged in any game of gambling , nor did he even begin to develop a liking to war , in which the Arabs of his time were constantly engaged in . 	0
Sir William Muir once stated " Our authorities all agree in ascribing to the youth of Muhammad a modesty of deportment and purity of manners rare among Meccans . " 	0
During his childhood , Muhammad garnered quite a reputation for his outstanding moral character , so much that he was titled al-Amin , or ' The Faithful ' . 	0
He spent to help those who were poor after marrying the wealthy widow Khadija , and in every instance did he free a slave who entered his household . 	0
When young , he become a member of the Hilfal-Fudzul , an alliance formed to vindicate the rights of the weak and help the plight of the poor . 	0
Muhammad would ' ve have rather spent his time in prayer , or in solitude , during much of his youth . 	0
Nor did Muhammad develop a fond of wealth , and not once was he energetic in pursuit of riches . 	0
So it follows , therefore , that God does not exist . 	1
In the balance are not only the dead and mutilated of Iraq ( and who knows how many from the invading force ) , but the very real possibility that such an act of pre-emptive world-destabilising aggression could spin out of control and lead to other despots pre-emptively arming themselves with all manner of apocalyptic weapons and , perhaps , to Armageddon . 	0

Given human freedom , God cannot guarantee how people are going to use that freedom . 	0
And if He intervenes every time to prevent people from choosing evil , then we turn into puppets or marionettes . 	0
Secondly , if God is all-powerful , can He in fact create a world of free creatures in which no harm occurs ? 	0
I think this is clearly not necessarily true . 	0
And therefore he hasn ' t been able to prove that harm and God are logically incompatible . 	1

Multiple Wits sources of varied ideological and other hues say that signs emerged very early in Reid Birley ' s tenure that she was extraordinarily difficult to work with and that the unanimous initial goodwill towards her steadily dissipated among those who had to interact with her daily . 	0
We report this week that senior Wits academics , whom we name with their permission and whose own transformation and gender credentials are impeccable , despairingly recount that Reid Birley repeatedly rejected long-term attempts at constructive intervention . 	0
It is also a matter of record that two very senior managers , recruited from an historically disadvantaged university and who can scarcely be said to be anti-transformation reactionaries , have distanced themselves from Reid Birley . 	0
With such considerations in mind , it is difficult to understand Reid Birley ' s claims that allegations against her are without substance . 	1

Decades of instability , he said , have reduced foreign investment in the region to a trickle . 	0
We think individuals around here are good because they want to minimize suffering in the world , among other reasons , and if we apply the same standard to God , we assume this is true of God , too . 	0
What my first argument draws attention to is that given God ' s , given God ' s omnibenevolence , God should desire to have a world in which there is as little suffering as possible , perhaps none . [ 8 ] Okay , this should be a desire of any good person , and we think that goodness will generalize . 	0
One quick aside , I ' m going to refer to God as " He , " more or less out of deference to tradition . 	0
So assume that since God is infinitely good , He desires to minimize suffering in this world . 	0
I also do it swallowing kind of hard implicit sexism , but please bear with me over that . 	0
I don ' t want to suggest that God has a gender , because that ' s not part of standard Christian doctrine . 	0
And lastly , God is omnipotent , so any design that God brings into being , God can actually implement . 	0
Secondly , God is omniscient , so God ' s supposed to figure out how to design a world that has basically no harm at all . [ 9 ] If you ' re omniscient , you ' re really smart , and you can figure these things out . 	0

Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1

The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

Even if Saddam s nuclear weapons program had made more progress than his crude attempt at a restart-the worst case-it was known to be less advanced than those of North Korea and Iran . 	0

We can know that Jesus rose from the dead , wholly apart from a consideration of historical evidence . 	0
We can know Jesus rose because Jesus is alive today and by God ' s spirit He is an living reality to those who follow him . 	0
The simplest Christian who has neither the oppurtunity nor wherewithal to conduct an historical investigation of Jesus ' resurrection can know with assurance that Jesus has risen simply because God ' s spirit bears unmistakable witness to Him that this is so . 	0
This means that no one is justified in rejecting the Christian faith simply because the evidence isn ' t good enough . 	0
If were no historical resurrection , then there then today there would be no encounter with the risen Lord and no witness of the Spirit . 	0
From the fact that there is such an encounter and witness , it follows logically that there was historical resurrection , even if in certain situations historical evidence concerning the resurrection , which is available at that time and place , is slim , ambiguous , or even deleterious .

Watching him once on a mobile phone to Mr Blair , striding up and down and wagging his finger , I felt I was hallucinating : surely here was the Prime Minister issuing orders to an official rather than the other way round ? 	0
It appears to us to be too extreme a penalty to strike a solicitor off in circumstances where there is no substantive charge of dishonesty or recklessness ; no finding that the Legal Aid Fund ( or anybody else ) paid out any money in respect of unjustified claims put forward by the solicitor or by staff under her actual supervision ; no finding that she was paid anything at all in the course of the matters complained of ; no finding of any cash shortage in relation to any of her clients ; and no previous conviction which related to a period earlier than the offences with which she was now charged . 	1

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1
I don ' t think this is necessarily true . 	0

In order to constitute a breach of privilege or contempt of the House , it has to be proved that the statement was not only wrong or misleading but it was made deliberately to mislead the House . 	0
It is well established that if any statement is made on the floor of the House by a Member or Minister which another Member believes to be untrue , incomplete or incorrect , it does not constitute a breach of privilege . 	0

Business investment and confidence are at a low , and not helped by the Government ' s failure to offer any hope that it is serious about joining the euro , which could offer exporters and inward investment a much-needed boost . 	0
I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

Take premise ( 2 ) , that an all powerful God can create any world that He wants . 	0
Now the problem with this argument is that Dr . Curley hasn ' t shown either of the two crucial premises to be necessarily true . 	0
So Dr . Curley would have to show that there is a world of free creatures , which God could create , which has as much good as this world , but which has less evil . 	0
If God wills to create free creatures , then it ' s logically impossible for Him to make them freely do what He wants . 	0
It is pure speculation . 	0
But how could he possibly prove such a thing ? 	0
What about premise ( 3 ) , that an all loving God would prefer a world without evil . 	0

Jeffrey : The UN covenant provides that the international community has a duty to intervene - 	0

So let ' s look at my first major contention together , that there are no good reasons to think that atheism is true . 	1
Atheism , or the claim that there is no God , is just as much a claim to know something as is theism , the claim that God does exist . 	0
Therefore , if the atheist is to prove his view , he must do more than say , " There ' s no good evidence for God ' s existence . " 	0
He must present positive evidence against God ' s existence . 	0
Atheist philosophers have tried for centuries to disprove the existence of God , but no one has been able to come up with a convincing argument . 	0

Study Reports on the International Situation-1997-1998 , a yearly compilation of the views of authors from a variety of institutes published by the Chinese Society for Strategy and Management , contained an article that argues why Russia and China are very natural strategic partners . 	1
The author , Zheng Yu , writes , " Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult " for Russia to be part of the West . 	0

A strong Chinese partnership with a recovering Russia is the preferred countermeasure . 	0
This chapter , which introduces the views of 55 Chinese authors on Russia , lists the factors they foresee Russia will face in its future dangerous security environment . 	0
Chinese military estimates of Russian national power by 2010 to 2020 place Russia as the second - or at least the third-ranking country in terms of overall military power . 	0

. 	0
In spite of these dangers , they believe Russia also has advantages , such as its potential partnership with China and advanced military concepts and technology , which cause China to assess the Russians as far more likely to exploit successfully the revolution in military affairs ( RMA ) than the United States . 	0

and is taking aim at America ' s commanding position in the RMA . " 	0
