Li Yonggang , a scholar at the Chinese Society for Strategy and Management , holds a similar view , " By dismembering the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or forcing Milosevic to surrender , the external front of Russia will be brushed away , therefore , Russia will be further oppressed , which is the key step to finally annihilating Russia .

He writes , " In addition to sharing the advantages of militarily and politically squeezing out Russia , " one of the reasons " NATO European powers have been so enthusiastic " about their actions in Yugoslavia is that it is an " attempt to get through the Balkan corridor in the south and extend their sphere of economic influence to Central Asia and even further to a wider scope .

When a habeas petitioner s claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings , 28 U . S .

Still , it is possible that , should war erupt in Iraq , American and British forces might fall foul of , for example , the provision of the ICC treaty outlawing attacks on military targets that cause " clearly excessive " harm to civilians . 	0
The weapon most likely to produce such harm is the cluster bomb . 	0
A typical cluster bomb is a container that opens in mid-air and scatters up to 200 bomblets over an area the size of half a soccer field . 	0

Sky News correspondent Jeff Reed rose after one of those military briefings in Doha to ask : " Can I ask the daily weapons of mass destruction question ? 	0

This is because , as you go back in time , you reach a point at which , in Hoyle ' s words , the universe was " shrunk down to nothing at all . " { 6 } Thus , what the Big Bang model requires is that the universe began to exist and was created out of nothing . 	0
Therefore , as the Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle points out , the Big Bang theory requires the creation of the universe from nothing . 	1
Physical space and time were created in that event , as well as all the matter and energy in the universe . 	0
The astrophysical evidence indicates the universe began to exist in a cataclysmic explosion known as the Big Bang 15 billion years ago . 	0
This conclusion has been confirmed by a series of remarkable discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics . 	0
Therefore , the series of past events can ' t go back forever ; rather the universe must have begun to exist . 	0

Says jurist Fali S . Nariman , " There is no international law justifying a state taking pre-emptive military action against another state where the doctrine of necessity would not so warrant . 	0

If not , the very act of war would be illegal , and Saddam ' s reign of brutality glossed by his one truth : that Iraq possessed no wmd . 	1

Naturalistic philosophy has worked out a strategy to prevent this problem from arising : it labels naturalism as science and theism as religion . 	0

Thus , in essence , the submission is that the war on terrorism is at least the equivalent to a conventional war , the military ' s judgment as to who is an enemy combatant should be upheld , and the rights available to citizens in relation to ordinary criminal prosecutions , e . g . the right to counsel , and the right to be brought before a court and charged within a reasonable time , are inapplicable . 	1
prisoners of war have no right to counsel ; iv . the military has properly determined that Hamdi was an enemy combatant , " the executives ' determination that someone is an enemy combatant and should be detained as such [ being ] one of the most fundamental military judgments of all " , v . the sworn declaration explaining the military ' s determination readily satisfies any constitutionally appropriate standard of judicial review . 	0

Jeffrey : . . . the basic criterion is continuing to commit crimes against humanity , the most common is the killing of civilians , sometimes the killing of prisoners , political prisoners and so forth , but you construct the legality of intervention because otherwise we ' d never intervene no matter what barbarities were happening . 	0
Clifford : No , military intervention has to be authorised by the security council . 	0
Jeffrey : The UN covenant provides that the international community has a duty to intervene - 	0
But the security council authorises it under chapter 7 which means there ' s a grave threat to the peace , and under some international conventions which this country and even America in the case of the genocide convention has signed , there is a duty to intervene . 	0
