So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1
I don ' t think this is necessarily true . 	0
First of all , if God is all-good , is it necessarily true that He would want to create a world with no suffering ? 	0

They did not think of God as an inferred entity , but as an experienced reality . . . . 	0
