The second argument I want to give against God ' s existence draws attention to the fact that the definition of God in classical Christianity is , I think , contradictory . 	0
As far I know , it ' s common to think of God as an abstract object , the kind of abstract object that Professor Craig talked about . 	0
God is said to be timeless , and the only timeless things around are abstract objects . 	0
At the same time , it ' s believed that God is causally efficacious , that is that God can affect material objects . 	0
God brought the universe into existence , we ' re told , and God can influence the events of the world on a day-to-day , hour-to-hour , and second-to-second basis . 	0

In a partnership action , especially where the partnership agreement was oral rather than by deed , it is not uncommon for issues to arise on the taking of the accounts in the course of winding up and for those issues to be directed to be tried in order to determine the legal and factual basis on which the accounts should be taken . 	0

Not even did the blessed Biblical prophets , nor Jesus himself change the behavior of a people so steeped in immorality and idolatry . 	0

They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	1
But , what is different between Muhammad and other perported figures who claimed Divine Revelation , were those who were closest to him . 	0
So , if Muhammad exhibited such outstanding moral characteristics that those who were not close to him would come to believe that he was always a trustworthy and honourable person , and that they would have no reason to disbelieve in his claim of Divine Revelation . 	0

Certainly these characteristics were unusual in a man surrounded by a society indulged in all forms of idolatry and immorality . 	0
During his youth , Muhammad never once touched wine , nor engaged in any game of gambling , nor did he even begin to develop a liking to war , in which the Arabs of his time were constantly engaged in . 	0
Sir William Muir once stated " Our authorities all agree in ascribing to the youth of Muhammad a modesty of deportment and purity of manners rare among Meccans . " 	0
During his childhood , Muhammad garnered quite a reputation for his outstanding moral character , so much that he was titled al-Amin , or ' The Faithful ' . 	0
He spent to help those who were poor after marrying the wealthy widow Khadija , and in every instance did he free a slave who entered his household . 	0
When young , he become a member of the Hilfal-Fudzul , an alliance formed to vindicate the rights of the weak and help the plight of the poor . 	0
Muhammad would ' ve have rather spent his time in prayer , or in solitude , during much of his youth . 	0
Nor did Muhammad develop a fond of wealth , and not once was he energetic in pursuit of riches . 	0

We think individuals around here are good because they want to minimize suffering in the world , among other reasons , and if we apply the same standard to God , we assume this is true of God , too . 	0
What my first argument draws attention to is that given God ' s , given God ' s omnibenevolence , God should desire to have a world in which there is as little suffering as possible , perhaps none .

This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0

How can those , especially Vajpayee who bayed for blood at the special extended session of Parliament on December 29-30 1993 and then disrupted proceedings for two long weeks from July 27 to August 11 1994 , now turn their backs on the principles they so vigorously upheld when they were in Opposition ? 	1
If no minister is responsible for all that went wrong in our capital markets over the first eighteen months of this government ' s rule ( October 1999 to March 2001 , the period of the scam as defined by the JPC ) does it mean the liberalisation of the economy has liberated ministers from their responsibility to the country through Parliament ? 	0

Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1

The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1

It increasingly requires education of national and foreign judges to explain the jurisprudence and context for prosecution . 	0
I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

Take premise ( 2 ) , that an all powerful God can create any world that He wants . 	0
Now the problem with this argument is that Dr . Curley hasn ' t shown either of the two crucial premises to be necessarily true . 	0
So Dr . Curley would have to show that there is a world of free creatures , which God could create , which has as much good as this world , but which has less evil . 	0
If God wills to create free creatures , then it ' s logically impossible for Him to make them freely do what He wants . 	0

Clifford : No , military intervention has to be authorised by the security council . 	0
Jeffrey : The UN covenant provides that the international community has a duty to intervene - 	0
But the security council authorises it under chapter 7 which means there ' s a grave threat to the peace , and under some international conventions which this country and even America in the case of the genocide convention has signed , there is a duty to intervene . 	0

So let ' s look at my first major contention together , that there are no good reasons to think that atheism is true . 	1
Atheism , or the claim that there is no God , is just as much a claim to know something as is theism , the claim that God does exist . 	0
Therefore , if the atheist is to prove his view , he must do more than say , " There ' s no good evidence for God ' s existence . " 	0
He must present positive evidence against God ' s existence . 	0

Well , before I give you an estimation , let me just give you some numbers to give you a feel for the odds . 	0
How much more probable ? 	0
We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life - permitting universes like ours . 	0
God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe . { 8 } During the last thirty years , scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicately balanced set of initial conditions simply given in the Big Bang itself . 	1
Donald Page , one of America ' s eminent cosmologists , has calculated the odds of our universe existing as on the order of one chance out of 1010 ( 123 ) , a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement ! { 9 } Robert Jastrow , the head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God " ever to come out of science . " { 10 } Once again , the view that Christian theists have always held , that there is an intelligent designer of the Cosmos , seems to me to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation of chance . 	0
Now with those numbers in mind , consider the following . 	0
The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is about1080 . 	0
The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 1018 , that ' s ten followed by eighteen zeros . 	0

After more than a decade of diplomacy , we gave Saddam Hussein another chance , a final chance , to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world . 	0

The author , Zheng Yu , writes , " Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult " for Russia to be part of the West . 	0

Chinese military estimates of Russian national power by 2010 to 2020 place Russia as the second - or at least the third-ranking country in terms of overall military power . 	0

. 	0
In spite of these dangers , they believe Russia also has advantages , such as its potential partnership with China and advanced military concepts and technology , which cause China to assess the Russians as far more likely to exploit successfully the revolution in military affairs ( RMA ) than the United States . 	0
