Given human freedom , God cannot guarantee how people are going to use that freedom . 	0
And if He intervenes every time to prevent people from choosing evil , then we turn into puppets or marionettes . 	0
Secondly , if God is all-powerful , can He in fact create a world of free creatures in which no harm occurs ? 	0
I think this is clearly not necessarily true . 	0
And therefore he hasn ' t been able to prove that harm and God are logically incompatible . 	1

The Army of Palestine is claiming responsibility for yesterday ' s atrocity , but that does not rule out the involvement of bin Laden ' s organisation ; when the American embassy in Nairobi was bombed in 1998 , al-Qa ' eda operated in the name of the Islamic Army against the Jews and the Crusaders . 	1

Glasgow NHS chiefs want ban on smoking " Evening Telegraph " , monday , September 16 , 2004 , p . 6 	0
Those of us who work in the Health Service see every day the tragic consequences of exposure to the powerful carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke . 	0
The damage done by cigarettes is suffered disproportionately by the poor and if we are serious about narrowing health inequalities we must do what we can to discourage cigarette smoking and to protect the majority of Scots who choose not to smoke from damage to their health . 	0
Environmental tobacco smoke damages the health of every Scot from the youngest to the oldest . 	1

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1
I don ' t think this is necessarily true . 	0
First of all , if God is all-good , is it necessarily true that He would want to create a world with no suffering ? 	0
It would lead to total irresponsibility , total irrationality in our actions . 	0
It could be that if God were to create a world of free creatures in which He intervened every time to rescue us from harm , this would be a world in which rational behavior was completely impossible . 	0
