Multiple Wits sources of varied ideological and other hues say that signs emerged very early in Reid Birley ' s tenure that she was extraordinarily difficult to work with and that the unanimous initial goodwill towards her steadily dissipated among those who had to interact with her daily . 	0
We report this week that senior Wits academics , whom we name with their permission and whose own transformation and gender credentials are impeccable , despairingly recount that Reid Birley repeatedly rejected long-term attempts at constructive intervention . 	0
It is also a matter of record that two very senior managers , recruited from an historically disadvantaged university and who can scarcely be said to be anti-transformation reactionaries , have distanced themselves from Reid Birley . 	0
With such considerations in mind , it is difficult to understand Reid Birley ' s claims that allegations against her are without substance . 	1

To evaluate that response , I need to know whether natural selection really has the fantastic creative power attributed to it . 	0
A typical Darwinian response is that there is no reason to invoke supernatural action because Darwinian selection was capable of performing the job . 	0
Suppose , for example , that I want to know whether God really had something to do with creating living organisms . 	0
The continuing survival of Darwinist orthodoxy illustrates Thomas Kuhn ' s famous point that the accumulation of anomalies never in itself falsifies a paradigm , because " To reject one paradigm without substituting another is to reject science itself . " [ 5 ] This practice may be appropriate as a way of carrying on the professional enterprise called science , but it can be grossly misleading when it is imposed upon persons who are asking questions other than the ones scientific naturalists want to ask . 	0
He rejected objections based on a number of grounds , including inadequacy of the authority ' s Economic Impact Study and Environmental Assessment , incompatibility with EC Directives , and adverse effects on public safety . 	0
All I want them to do is to be candid about the disconfirming evidence and admit , if it is the case , that they are hanging on to Darwinism only because they prefer a shaky theory to having no theory at all . 	1
I am not suggesting that scientists have to change their rules about retaining and discarding paradigms . 	0
The fact that scientists don ' t like to say " we don ' t know " tells me nothing about what they really do know . 	0
It is not a sufficient answer to say that scientists have nothing better to offer . 	0

Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0
