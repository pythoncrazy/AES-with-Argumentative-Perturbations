If no minister is responsible for all that went wrong in our capital markets over the first eighteen months of this government ' s rule ( October 1999 to March 2001 , the period of the scam as defined by the JPC ) does it mean the liberalisation of the economy has liberated ministers from their responsibility to the country through Parliament ? 	0

Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1

It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0
