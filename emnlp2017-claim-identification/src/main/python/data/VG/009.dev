God is said to be timeless , and the only timeless things around are abstract objects . 	0
At the same time , it ' s believed that God is causally efficacious , that is that God can affect material objects . 	0
God brought the universe into existence , we ' re told , and God can influence the events of the world on a day-to-day , hour-to-hour , and second-to-second basis . 	0

This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0

Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

I think that when you think about this , clearly it would make rational behavior completely impossible . 	0

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1
I don ' t think this is necessarily true . 	0
First of all , if God is all-good , is it necessarily true that He would want to create a world with no suffering ? 	0
It would lead to total irresponsibility , total irrationality in our actions . 	0

Let me just cite the Harper Collins Dictionary of Philosophy , which defines material objects as " an object that causally interacts or inter-relates with other independently existing things . " 	0
An abstract object is defined as " an object that is not a material object , " so an abstract object is an object that does not causally interact with other indepedently existing things . 	0
It increasingly requires education of national and foreign judges to explain the jurisprudence and context for prosecution . 	0
I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1
9 . 	0
Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0
That something more of this security exists at the present moment , I not only admit , but contend that the prospect is improving every day , and that this becomes more and more ascertained C .

So , if Muhammad exhibited such outstanding moral characteristics that those who were not close to him would come to believe that he was always a trustworthy and honourable person , and that they would have no reason to disbelieve in his claim of Divine Revelation . 	0
