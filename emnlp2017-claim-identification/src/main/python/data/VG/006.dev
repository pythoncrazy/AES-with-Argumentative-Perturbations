This doctrine has implications I find appalling . 	0
It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace , have not been forgiven , and will , if we continue in that state , go to Hell . 	0
So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1
Consistently with the doctrine of original sin , it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified , it is by faith in Jesus . 	0
Since we are all sinners , we cannot earn salvation by our works . 	0
But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous . 	0
The mark of our having been forgiven is that God , by an act of grace , gives us faith . 	0

Still , it is possible that , should war erupt in Iraq , American and British forces might fall foul of , for example , the provision of the ICC treaty outlawing attacks on military targets that cause " clearly excessive " harm to civilians . 	0
Iraq ' s weapons would be presented to inspectors , and the world would witness their destruction . 	0
Instead , with the world demanding disarmament , and more than 200 , 000 troops positioned near his country , Saddam Hussein ' s response is to produce a few weapons for show , while he hides the rest and builds even more . 	0
http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_030703.htm 	0
The weapon most likely to produce such harm is the cluster bomb . 	0
A typical cluster bomb is a container that opens in mid-air and scatters up to 200 bomblets over an area the size of half a soccer field . 	0
To evaluate that response , I need to know whether natural selection really has the fantastic creative power attributed to it . 	0
A typical Darwinian response is that there is no reason to invoke supernatural action because Darwinian selection was capable of performing the job . 	0
Suppose , for example , that I want to know whether God really had something to do with creating living organisms . 	0
The continuing survival of Darwinist orthodoxy illustrates Thomas Kuhn ' s famous point that the accumulation of anomalies never in itself falsifies a paradigm , because " To reject one paradigm without substituting another is to reject science itself . " [ 5 ] This practice may be appropriate as a way of carrying on the professional enterprise called science , but it can be grossly misleading when it is imposed upon persons who are asking questions other than the ones scientific naturalists want to ask . 	0
All I want them to do is to be candid about the disconfirming evidence and admit , if it is the case , that they are hanging on to Darwinism only because they prefer a shaky theory to having no theory at all . 	1
I am not suggesting that scientists have to change their rules about retaining and discarding paradigms . 	0
The fact that scientists don ' t like to say " we don ' t know " tells me nothing about what they really do know . 	0

It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

Even in their new , " wind-corrected " form , cluster bombs are not precision weapons . 	0
