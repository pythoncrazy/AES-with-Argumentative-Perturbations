So let ' s look at my first major contention together , that there are no good reasons to think that atheism is true . 	1
Atheism , or the claim that there is no God , is just as much a claim to know something as is theism , the claim that God does exist . 	0
Therefore , if the atheist is to prove his view , he must do more than say , " There ' s no good evidence for God ' s existence . " 	0
He must present positive evidence against God ' s existence . 	0

Approaching the matter in that way , I am satisfied that the present is not a very exceptional case of that kind . 	0
The claimants have published articles supporting a transition to a republic and , even though Mr Rusbridger specifically drew the articles to the attention of the Attorney-General , they have not been prosecuted . 	0
Their decisions as to whether or not to publish such articles are not affected in any way by the existence of section 3 . 	0
The issue of the compatibility or incompatibility of that section with article 10 is therefore moot so far as the claimants are concerned . 	1
And as freedom advances heart by heart , and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world more peaceful . 	1
Look at the figures : 121 Labour MPs , 13 Tories ( including Mr Clarke ) and 52 Liberal Democrats voted for an amendment declaring the case against Saddam Hussein as yet unproven . 	0
A total of 199 MPs voted against early military action , while 393 voted for war . 	0
But if fewer than 100 of the 125 Tories who backed Mr Blair had instead voted with Mr Clarke , the Prime Minister would have lost . 	0
So the Tories , amazingly , can still make a difference . 	1
Again , it is pure speculation . 	0
And I just deny that equation . 	0
I am not a Calvinist . 	0

I want to thank Dr . Curley for his very personal and sensitive remarks . 	0
In this speech , I hope to show , however , that most of his objections are aimed at a false target , at a conception of God which I , as a Christian , reject . 	0
What Dr . Curley offers is really seven deadly objections to the Calvinistic God , not the Christian God . 	0
It is only by equating Calvinism with Christianity that his objections have any force . 	1
And the purpose of life is not happiness , as such , but rather the knowledge of God and His salvation which will ultimately bring true happiness . 	0
But many evils occur in life which are utterly pointless with respect to producing human happiness . 	0
But they may not be pointless with respect to producing a deeper knowledge of God . 	0
Dr . Curley would have to prove that there is another world that God could have created with this much knowledge of God and His salvation but with less evils . 	0
And , therefore , the problem of evil , I think , is simply inconclusive and doesn ' t disprove Christian theism http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/craig-curley04.html 	0
If used where civilians are present , the size of the area they attack and the difficulty of directing them reliably mean that civilian casualties - sometimes substantial casualties - are foreseeable . 	0
A court conceivably could find that the use of cluster bombs in such circumstances is a war crime 	1
A typical cluster bomb is a container that opens in mid-air and scatters up to 200 bomblets over an area the size of half a soccer field . 	0
Even in their new , " wind-corrected " form , cluster bombs are not precision weapons . 	0
Friend will be aware of the recent Environment Agency report showing from research that within a radius of 2 km from a hazardous waste site , recorded birth defects are 7 per cent . 	0

What is the Department doing to research that and to find out what the direct link is , and what joint work is being done by his Department and the Department of Health to ensure that people are protected ? 	1
The Israelis continue to settle people of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan , so they do not intend to allow it to be a Palestinian homeland . 	1

So he is a better candidate for the promotion than Marvin . 	1
Sam is more astute than Marvin : he is a clearer thinker and knows more about the company s product line . 	0
Brian Cotter : Bearing in mind the fact that Axa Insurance has today announced that 210 , 000 small firms are operating without employer ' s liability , and therefore illegally , will the Minister ask the Department for Work and Pensions to carry out its review urgently , ensure that it covers issues such as competitive practices and consistency of cover , and ensure that firms are given proper notice when the insurance basis is to be changed ? 	1
He has thus far refused . 	0
All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end . 	0
In recent days , some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part . 	0
They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq , so that disarmament can proceed peacefully . 	0
For their own safety , all foreign nationals - - including journalists and inspectors - - should leave Iraq immediately . 	0
http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_031803.htm 	0
Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours . 	1
Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , commenced at a time of our choosing . 	0
Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone , including the Iraqi people . 	0
Do not destroy oil wells , a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people . 	1
In any conflict , your fate will depend on your action . 	0
And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning . 	0
And it will be no defense to say , " I was just following orders . " http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_031803.htm 	0

Now , on what basis do have of condemning his claim of recieving Divine Revelation as demonic ? 	0
If we were to take a look at Arabia before and after the coming of Muhammad , we would see two completely different societies . 	0
They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	0
He was affectionate towards everyone , never interupted their speech , no matter how short or long , always was the first to stretch his hand to greet , and the last to let go . 	0
Unlike the U . K . , the U . S . has not revealed the number of ground-launched cluster munitions used in Iraq . 	0
