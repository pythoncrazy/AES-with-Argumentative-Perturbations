These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . 	0
A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . 	0
There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	0
Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . 	1
And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . 	0
In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . 	0
If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing . 	0
After all , you spend most of your day at office . 	0
This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships . 	0
Finally , the co-workers should believe in fellowship . 	1
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	1
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
Based on the above discussion , I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem . 	1
The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . 	0
Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . 	1
In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	0
Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . 	0
In other word , tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential . 	0
Secondly , even though environmental damage is inevitable , it is not tourism to be blamed for . 	0
First of all , tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be . 	1
Basically , places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet . 	0
Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up . 	0
It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents . 	0
Tourism : good or bad ? 	0
Tourism , since its first appearance a long time ago , can be described as a controversial celebrity . 	0
Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion , environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places . 	0
However , I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons . 	0
Otherwise , the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday . 	0
Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	0
All in all , I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world . 	1
Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	0
Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . 	1
As a mass media majoring student , I think that it ' s true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society . 	1
Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media 	0
My reasons include the following : It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . 	1
In my point of view , disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages . 	1
However , journalism is changing . 	0
The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . 	0
First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . 	1
Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	0
Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	0
The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . 	0
On the other side , if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss , only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position . 	1
Consequently , make a good relationship with them . 	1
To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned , good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons . 	0
Ability to Relate Well to people Vs Studying Hard 	0
First of all , friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career . 	0
However , if one coniders the issue carefully , he or she may agree the title statement as I do . 	0
Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions . 	0
Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job . 	1
If top-level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them . 	0
Futuermore , no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue . 	0
First , under globalization and industrial integration , the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging . 	1
The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world . 	0
Some people believe that little things changed through generation , while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation . 	1
Challenges are different from generation to generation 	0
While debating about generation issues , people always have different opinions . 	0
According to statistics , 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet . 	0
Further , by means of some communication tools , it has become very easy to make new friends . 	0
However , the other side of the coin is that , by communicating via Internet or phone , we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully , because during such conversations , some of our words can make a completely different sense . 	0
In this sense , Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends . 	1
By way of conclusion , I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable . 	1
As a result , the rate of divorces is increasing day by day . 	1
Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance . 	0
As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever . 	0
Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education . 	0
The Internet is an adequate source of academic information 	0
Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . 	0
This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . 	0
Personally , I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning . 	1
However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists . 	0
Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace . 	0
First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils . 	1
We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present . 	1
What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media . 	1
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
However , using computer can make people easier to complete their work . 	1
As it can be seen from the example , the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected . 	0
A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to , due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working . 	0
I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people . 	1
However , I strongly believe that computer can influence society , and people ' s lives have already been controlled by device . 	1
Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing , and they cannot do anything without that device . 	0
However , many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life . 	0
People use computer particularly for work , study , even for communication . 	0
Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life . 	0
Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use 	0
It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . 	0
First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . 	0
Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . 	0
Study at school or get a job ? 	0
Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school . 	1
Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . 	0
Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . 	0
Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . 	0
For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	0
Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . 	1
All thing considered , tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact . 	1
In my opinion , the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings . 	1
Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment-friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures . 	0
Because of that , tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity . 	1
In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration . 	0
To be precise , for instance , a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild . 	0
Instead of this , some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution . 	0
After analyzing both points of view , I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process . 	1
Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study . 	0
This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances . 	0
Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? 	0
However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself . 	0
Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs . 	1
Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying . 	0
College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries . 	0
In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . 	1
While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query . 	0
Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . 	0
Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade 	0
Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . 	0
Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries . 	1
On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . 	0
High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . 	0
Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . 	0
To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	1
In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . 	1
Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . 	0
In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language . 	1
Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to . 	1
On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice . 	0
There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language . 	0
When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible . 	1
Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
As a result , rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh . 	1
Needless to say , their action will make a beeline for obesity , short-sighted , diabetes and other heart-related problems . 	0
In conclusion , despite the contribution of IT to the society , its effect on the users ' independence and prositution should not be out of concern . 	1
They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . 	0
Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . 	0
Overall , I believe that students should study at school . 	1
Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	0
There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job . 	0
Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job , studying at school is always the best choice for children ' s future . 	1
The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	0
As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . 	0
Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland . 	1
In conclusion , richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade . 	1
Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . 	1
Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	1
For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . 	0
Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . 	0
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions . 	1
This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	0
For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . 	0
This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . 	0
Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . 	0
In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . 	1
As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	0
Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported . 	0
However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well . 	1
On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government . 	0
It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society . 	0
Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences . 	0
This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable . 	1
Should government control media crime 	0
The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media . 	1
It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy . 	0
In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure . 	0
The co-workers should be cooperative with one another . 	0
If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes . 	0
I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious . 	0
Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not . 	0
Some important characteristics of a co-worker 	0
At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment . 	0
However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . 	0
Therefore in my view , a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship . 	1
The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . 	0
Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . 	1
To sum up , not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind , but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways . 	1
This situation becomes lifestyle habits , and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use . 	0
Every day , people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it . 	1
In conclusion , in era technology like this age , computer becomes important thing in human life . 	1
This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer . 	0
Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country . 	0
Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues . 	0
In my opinion , by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution . 	1
On the other hand , I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies . 	1
Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals . 	1
In conclusion , due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution , both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution . 	1
Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment . 	0
What is more , the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict , therefore , staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative . 	0
With the rapid developing pace , IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves . 	1
In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going . 	0
However , it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental . 	0
In my opinion , there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense . 	1
Future information technology : positive or negative ? 	0
The appearance of information technology ( IT ) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency . 	0
This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive . 	0
For example , in earlier times , people didn ' t leave for faraway places , because they could easily get lost . 	0
But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative . 	0
Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . 	0
No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . 	0
The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate . 	0
The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts 	0
First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . 	1
While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services , I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society . 	1
However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . 	0
Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . 	0
On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . 	1
There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . 	0
As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong . 	0
However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children ’ s television programs . 	0
Admittedly , reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate . 	0
Personally , I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids , while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable . 	1
Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today . 	0
Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society . 	0
Large amount of violence in television programs 	0
Nevertheless , it would certainly be a violation of adults ’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences . 	1
Therefore , it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies . 	1
For example , now there are more chances to do business with people around the world , so besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well . 	0
For another example , financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century , thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management . 	0
I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution . 	1
First , in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions . 	0
Air pollution 	0
Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way . 	0
If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause . 	1
Second , private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating . 	0
The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution . 	0
While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution . 	0
However , as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges . 	0
It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them . 	0
They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences . 	0
In conclusion , challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation , whether in career or in self-identification . 	1
It is hard to judge which generation ' s problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation , there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters . 	1
Second , this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation . 	1
The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them . 	0
They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
To begin with , nowadays , to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever . 	0
From my point of view , this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks . 	1
By means of some software such as Skype , MSN , Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want . 	0
Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present , it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete . 	1
Nowadays , the Earth has become like a small village . 	0
Technology impact on people 	0
In the course of the last hundred years , the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology . 	0
In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage . 	0
For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . 	0
In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . 	0
Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . 	0
They are being rude towards others . 	0
A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues 	0
Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . 	0
First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . 	1
Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . 	0
Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . 	0
Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following . 	0
In conclusion , it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency ; however , the adults should not be the victim of this policy . 	1
Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them . 	0
For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment . 	0
Frequently , adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day . 	0
I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me . 	0
To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him . 	0
They should not act on suspicion . 	0
This is a very important aspect in the work environment . 	0
Therefore , I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment . 	1
The co-workers need to trust each other . 	1
When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse . 	0
From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility . 	0
However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me . 	0
But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department . 	0
On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process . 	1
Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	0
It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future . 	0
Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . 	0
The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . 	0
The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . 	0
To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . 	1
Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . 	1
There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	0
Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . 	0
Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? 	0
From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress . 	1
In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . 	0
This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers . 	0
Thus , it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations . 	1
Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely . 	0
To start , non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain . 	1
People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit . 	0
Smoking should be made prohibited in public places 	0
This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers : who are around smoking is taken place . 	0
Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral . 	0
After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public . 	0
Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents . 	0
In addition to what mentioned , medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind . 	1
In conclusion , in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places , technologies facilities , better education and medical services . 	1
But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation , because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly . 	1
Every technology has it ’ s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology . 	0
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns . 	1
Big city vs small town 	0
I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside . 	1
The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns . 	1
Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life , because the environment that a person grow up , build the personality and his / her culture . 	1
There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc . People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends . 	1
Better education results better career and been well paid . 	0
Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . 	0
To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . 	0
As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . 	0
If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . 	0
First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . 	1
In my opinion , we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons . 	1
But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? 	0
As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . 	0
In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . 	0
Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals 	0
In my point of view , I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school . 	1
Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job . 	0
However , someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job . 	1
I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future . 	0
But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? 	0
It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . 	0
However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace . 	0
Be wise and conscious . 	0
Little wonder , then , that by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes . 	0
Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
To my mind , there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual ' s life . 	1
For the above-mentioned reasons , I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood , which will be beneficial to our community . 	1
Accordingly , with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy . 	0
In addition , the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes . 	0
Lastly , it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand . 	1
There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers . 	0
It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job . 	0
Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money . 	0
Furthermore , it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs . 	1
There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall . 	0
No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills . 	0
He also has access to the most up-to-date language . 	0
On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives . 	0
He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country . 	0
Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language . 	0
Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way . 	0
Person ' A ' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method . 	1
In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country . 	0
Where to learn a new language ? 	0
Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries . 	1
Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . 	0
Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . 	1
As house heating is a major need in the winter time , some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes . 	0
Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person . 	0
However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor . 	0
For instance , further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health . 	0
In addition to this , introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing . 	1
After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka , it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement . 	1
As this shows , smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems . 	0
It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries . 	0
Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . 	0
The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click . 	0
Here is a positive example : Queens Center Mall , a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City , provides a wide vairtey of stores , products and services , from clothing to electronics and restaurants , that consumers can choose . 	0
It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York . 	0
I found that I could find virtually every brand or store , including Macy ' s and JCPenney , when I visited there . 	0
As far as I am concerned , a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time . 	1
I believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community 	0
I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community . 	1
The following are my reasons . 	0
In the first place , the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping . 	0
In contrast , young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually . 	1
They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want . 	0
Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns . 	0
In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers . 	0
It ’ s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life . 	0
