Developing globalization , people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world . 	0
During the history of the world , every change has its own positive and negative sides . 	0
Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more . 	1
In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages . 	1
In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together . 	1
Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . 	0
Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . 	1
As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	0
Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . 	0
It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life . 	0
As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time . 	1
What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles . 	1
From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path . 	1
To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc . People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end . 	0
For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives . 	0
However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case . 	0
Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons 	0
There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success . 	0
Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens . 	0
Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way . 	0
Instead , he hardly cared about something else . 	0
For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . 	0
Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others . 	0
However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax . 	1
Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well-being of the whole society . 	0
The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers . 	0
For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment . 	0
To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens . 	1
Personally , I tend to disagree with this view . 	0
Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that . 	0
Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country . 	0
Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens 	0
In conclusion , it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement . 	1
There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . 	0
Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . 	0
Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	0
Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	1
Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . 	1
Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . 	0
Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . 	0
Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . 	0
To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . 	0
Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
On the other side , if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss , only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position . 	1
Consequently , make a good relationship with them . 	1
To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned , good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons . 	0
Ability to Relate Well to people Vs Studying Hard 	0
First of all , friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career . 	0
However , if one coniders the issue carefully , he or she may agree the title statement as I do . 	0
Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions . 	0
Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job . 	1
If top-level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them . 	0
Futuermore , no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue . 	0
Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance . 	0
As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever . 	0
Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education . 	0
The Internet is an adequate source of academic information 	0
Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . 	0
This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . 	0
Personally , I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning . 	1
However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists . 	0
Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace . 	0
First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils . 	1
Personally , I agree with this statement . 	0
First , the core of group working is " consensus " . 	1
It ' s the idea that everyone ’ s opinion accounts . 	0
In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . 	0
People who can ’ t accept others ’ criticism can ’ t succeed in group working 	0
In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . 	0
It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . 	0
Therefore , here goes the point that people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working . 	1
In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . 	0
It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . 	0
What is more , the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area . 	0
To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit . 	0
However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution . 	0
Out of the case of economic development , industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society . 	0
Nowadays , whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society . 	0
Influence of large factories 	0
With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
Nonetheless , innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience . 	1
It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments . 	0
Hence , creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions . 	1
Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message . 	0
Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras . 	0
Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message . 	1
Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions 	0
Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious . 	0
Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds . 	0
Creativity originates in a free mind . 	1
Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
However , a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters . 	0
On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . 	1
To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . 	0
What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	0
On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . 	1
A more convenient life in a city 	0
There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . 	0
The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . 	0
However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons . 	1
You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . 	0
For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . 	0
However , the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness . 	1
Apparently , the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer , as they may be false , may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes . 	1
Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions . 	0
Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
However , using computer can make people easier to complete their work . 	1
As it can be seen from the example , the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected . 	0
A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to , due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working . 	0
I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people . 	1
However , I strongly believe that computer can influence society , and people ' s lives have already been controlled by device . 	1
Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing , and they cannot do anything without that device . 	0
However , many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life . 	0
People use computer particularly for work , study , even for communication . 	0
Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life . 	0
Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use 	0
Hence , I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work . 	1
Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies , but doing so can bring us a healthy body , a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness . 	1
A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society . 	1
And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it . 	0
However , buying habit is a very personal things for individuals , the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy , sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption . 	1
It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income . 	0
Advertising impact on people ' s choice of consumption 	0
Nowdays , people ' s choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television , street , magazine etc . This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life . 	1
For example , in most asian countries , advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales , and some people , especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs . 	0
In addition , products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought . 	0
Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase . 	0
On the other hand , children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not , since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary . 	1
Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . 	0
Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	0
If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	0
There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . 	1
If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . 	0
For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . 	0
But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	0
Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . 	1
In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in . 	1
With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does , and higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life . 	1
Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities . 	0
Finally , although I prefer to live in a big city , I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste , to be clear , I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress . 	1
Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . 	0
Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . 	0
Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	1
In conclusion , teachers are the best for children ' s education . 	1
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
After analyzing both points of view , I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process . 	1
Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study . 	0
This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances . 	0
Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? 	0
However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself . 	0
Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs . 	1
Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying . 	0
College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries . 	0
In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . 	1
While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query . 	0
So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them . 	1
Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time . 	0
Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people . 	0
Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose . 	1
Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely . 	1
However , artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people . 	0
Frank Zappa once said , " Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open “ . 	0
Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains . 	0
In addition , creativity also gives aesthetic charm . 	0
For instance , Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue . 	0
This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds . 	0
By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . 	0
For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . 	0
By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	0
However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	0
Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . 	1
In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . 	1
For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . 	0
Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects . 	1
Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . 	0
To sumarize , there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life . 	1
They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention . 	1
Therefore , children may see that this behavior is inexcusable . 	1
On the other hand , too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions . 	1
Question about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities 	0
Today , celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media . 	0
Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip . 	0
Not surprisingly , many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them , especially on their children . 	0
This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants . 	0
Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols . 	0
Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively . 	0
This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace . 	0
This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . 	0
That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . 	0
You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . 	0
Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . 	0
Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . 	0
So , I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at . 	1
If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . 	0
In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
Instead , the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price . 	0
Therefore , the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation . 	1
In short , this is not a long-term solution . 	0
Moreover , these products prove to ensure human health completely . 	0
Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure . 	0
Additionally , charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free . 	0
In conclusion , I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines , which may exacerbate their qualities . 	1
Fortunately , there are other measures to improve the situation . 	1
It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes . 	0
It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . 	0
As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . 	0
Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . 	0
Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . 	0
Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
Should the cost of medicines be reduced ? 	0
At present , a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases . 	0
It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths . 	0
Admittedly , more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines . 	0
The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs . 	0
With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses . 	0
If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better . 	0
The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity . 	1
However , in my view , reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons . 	1
Secondly , reading a novel is more convenient . 	1
The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . 	0
Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . 	1
To sum up , not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind , but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways . 	1
Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
This situation becomes lifestyle habits , and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use . 	0
Every day , people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it . 	1
In conclusion , in era technology like this age , computer becomes important thing in human life . 	1
This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer . 	0
Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country . 	0
Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues . 	0
In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . 	0
As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter “ . 	0
However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . 	0
Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . 	0
Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . 	1
Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . 	0
It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . 	0
Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . 	0
Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . 	0
However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? 	0
This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media , but from the basis of their own interests . 	0
In conclusion , parents should be more worried about their children ' s attitudes to the ' cult of celebrity ' . 	1
As recent surveys showed , inspired by the fame and wealth , children now prefer more to become an actor / actress or a sports star than it was in the past . 	0
Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable . 	0
They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life . 	0
When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . 	0
If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . 	0
As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	1
In summary , doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better . 	1
Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	1
Some people would rather watch TV . 	0
Reading fictions is more pleasant 	0
There are many different opinions regarding hobbies . 	0
Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening . 	0
For example , after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people . 	0
Firstly , fiction books pay more attention to details . 	1
In fact , we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it . 	0
I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . 	0
Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . 	0
In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . 	1
People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose . 	0
Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . 	0
No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . 	0
The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate . 	0
The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts 	0
First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . 	1
While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services , I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society . 	1
However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . 	0
Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . 	0
On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . 	1
There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . 	0
Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks . 	1
Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens . 	0
This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings . 	0
When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine . 	0
Nevertheless , I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises , which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally . 	1
In a nutshell , many activities can let humans relax . 	1
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	1
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life . 	0
From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government . 	0
It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity . 	0
In conclusion , even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits , it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly . 	1
For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently . 	0
However , still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum , instead , they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done . 	0
Besides , most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs . 	0
Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness . 	1
This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects . 	0
However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . 	0
Most importantly , under such target-oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study . 	0
Moreover , the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study . 	0
It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students ' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents , while its shortfalls are so vital to students ' future . 	1
Therefore , I do support the view of learning all school subjects . 	1
Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour . 	0
Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains . 	0
For example , I have started to read a novel since last week . 	0
I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class . 	0
In contrast , I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study . 	0
Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies . 	1
This point has some merits on the surface ; however , movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners . 	0
For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable . 	0
To sum up , reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth , are much easier to use , and more useful for language learners . 	1
To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . 	0
We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . 	0
To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems . 	1
One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . 	0
There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . 	1
Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . 	0
If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . 	0
By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . 	0
It would mean another industrial revolution . 	0
It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . 	0
Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . 	0
Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . 	0
Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . 	0
If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	0
In conclusion , we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity . 	1
They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	0
The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . 	1
People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . 	0
The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . 	0
Nevertheless , educators and individuals themselves , especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one . 	0
These factors affect people who work or study from home . 	1
Following both the point of views , the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
Thus , the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious . 	1
On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . 	0
They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies . 	0
In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling . 	0
Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly . 	0
Due to this they lag in their studies . 	0
Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues . 	0
This harms an employee ' s deliverable . 	0
I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering . 	1
In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people . 	1
First , it ' s true watching TV take a lot of your day , nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs . 	1
Second , people like having meals while they are watching TV . 	1
Television destroys communication among friends and family 	0
Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day . 	0
Besides , watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros . 	0
However , while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families , I believe it has done the opposite . 	0
Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends . 	1
For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights . 	0
In conclusion , I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress . 	1
I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them . 	0
From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations . 	0
However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences . 	1
This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . 	0
Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation . 	0
Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline . 	0
Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency . 	0
Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy . 	0
Early retirement for 55 + employees to help younger people 	0
Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits . 	1
Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case . 	0
It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future . 	0
Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns . 	1
Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety . 	1
Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities , a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities . 	0
Living in big cities or living in small towns 	0
This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people ' s preferences for where to live . 	0
From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people . 	0
First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world . 	1
For me , I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones , this personal attitude is the result of many factors . 	1
For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns . 	0
Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for . 	0
It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating . 	0
Personally , I believe such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether . 	1
Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes . 	0
Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society 	0
Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes . 	1
These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings . 	0
Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced . 	1
We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	0
They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . 	0
They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . 	0
Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . 	1
On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . 	1
If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	0
It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . 	0
Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? 	0
In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints . 	0
Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . 	0
People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . 	0
Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . 	0
Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . 	0
However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . 	0
First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . 	1
Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . 	0
With this situation , some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language . 	1
I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means . 	0
Email and text messaging threats written language 	0
The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . 	0
Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ? 	0
There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . 	0
It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . 	0
However , from my point of view , what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society . 	1
It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . 	0
This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed . 	0
In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . 	1
Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . 	0
Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing . 	0
Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world . 	1
In my point of view , I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school . 	1
Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job . 	0
However , someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job . 	1
I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future . 	0
But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? 	0
Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws . 	1
Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries . 	1
I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression . 	1
Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
The main disadvantage is contamination . 	1
For example , the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need . 	0
First of all , a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate . 	1
From my point of view , the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories . 	1
It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . 	0
However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace . 	0
Be wise and conscious . 	0
This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police . 	0
An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise . 	0
Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken . 	1
Having one ' s own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits . 	1
First , having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit . 	1
Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze , so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted . 	0
My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company . 	0
People should have hobbies and do physical activities 	0
Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question . 	0
Different people have different ideas . 	0
Some people think we should focus on our jobs , but I don ' t agree with them . 	0
He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise . 	0
When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight . 	0
Last , we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured . 	1
Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar . 	0
Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty-four hours . 	0
Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries . 	0
Also , doing something for a long time can be boring , having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind . 	1
For example , at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class . 	0
He started to jog every morning . 	0
After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend . 	0
When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves . 	0
It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence . 	0
And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	0
By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . 	0
Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . 	0
Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages 	0
In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex . 	1
Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . 	0
By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . 	1
School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . 	0
They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . 	0
In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . 	0
So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need . 	1
In my opinion , I think buying habit is people ' s choice to make , not entirely affected by advertisements . 	1
But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop , it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising . 	0
It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident . 	0
In conclusion , criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism . 	1
And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	0
You should have your own judgments too ! 	0
Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . 	0
In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . 	1
Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? 	0
What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? 	0
For the above-mentioned reasons , I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood , which will be beneficial to our community . 	1
Accordingly , with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy . 	0
In addition , the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes . 	0
Lastly , it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand . 	1
There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers . 	0
It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job . 	0
Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money . 	0
Furthermore , it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs . 	1
There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall . 	0
Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . 	0
Those who disagree , believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects . 	1
Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country . 	1
They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments . 	0
Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception . 	0
Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world ; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue . 	0
Effects of globalization 	0
In addition , they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries . 	0
Moreover , the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization . 	1
Sports activities can improve mental health as well . 	1
Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises . 	0
Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies , such as reading , watching movies , or working in their gardens , I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise , which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions . 	1
Therefore , it is necessary for many to find ways to relax . 	0
In modern society , people often face many difficulties under great stress . 	0
The best way to relax is by exercises 	0
The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity . 	0
Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body . 	0
Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system . 	0
It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health . 	1
The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage 	0
Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one ' s personal as well as professional life . 	0
The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university . 	0
Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage . 	0
Both the points of views will be discussed in order . 	0
On the one hand , the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous . 	0
For one , it helps working people to maintain work life balance . 	0
The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby . 	0
People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours . 	0
For students too , studying from home is an attractive option . 	0
On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	0
Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . 	0
I , for one , strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . 	1
First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . 	0
As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . 	1
To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . 	0
Should people be forced to stop working ? 	0
The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . 	0
Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . 	0
In my personal point of view , the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old . 	1
Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject . 	0
Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children . 	0
Should teenagers learn all school subjects / focus on one subject 	0
Presently , it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school . 	0
The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized . 	1
In the first place , with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future . 	0
While , others claim that studying only one subject is more effective . 	0
Before rendering my own opinion , I will explore sides of this topic . 	0
Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate . 	0
In students ' point of view , the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes . 	0
For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
Its convenience saves our time . 	1
Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way . 	0
In conclusion , installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries . 	0
In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well . 	0
Therefore , how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it . 	1
However , it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society . 	0
For instance , in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances . 	0
It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems . 	0
Other than that , they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way . 	1
In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . 	0
So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department . 	0
There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited . 	0
Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force . 	0
In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support . 	0
It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough . 	0
To sum up , TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation . 	1
As well as it ' s one way of recent communications , based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people . 	1
Moreover , TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV , WDTV using Skype , tango and other apps . 	0
In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends ; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV . 	1
It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema . 	0
Third , TV can be one of communication ways . 	0

I found that I could find virtually every brand or store , including Macy ' s and JCPenney , when I visited there . 	0
As far as I am concerned , a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time . 	1
I believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community 	0
I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community . 	1
The following are my reasons . 	0
In the first place , the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping . 	0
Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . 	0
It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . 	1
First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . 	1
When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . 	0
Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . 	0
In my opinion , the latter opinion is true . 	0
Computer has negative effects to children 	0
