Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	1
In conclusion , " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers . 	1
Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . 	0
In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . 	0
Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . 	0
Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . 	1
Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . 	0
Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . 	1
Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational . 	1
Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . 	0
Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . 	1
In my opinion , all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved . 	1
There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . 	0
Old buildings should be preserved 	0
The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . 	0
Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	0
Old buildings are an essential part of history . 	0
As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . 	0
Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . 	1
In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . 	0
Which one is the promising way to succeed ? 	0
As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . 	0
In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . 	0
If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . 	0
We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . 	0
Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . 	0
Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . 	1
Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	1
Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . 	0
It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . 	0
This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . 	0
It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . 	0
Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums . 	0
Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity . 	0
Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city . 	1
Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint . 	0
He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . 	0
They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . 	0
Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	0
In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . 	0
They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . 	0
This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . 	0
Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . 	1
If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . 	0
They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . 	0
Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	1
Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds . 	1
Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture . 	0
Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle . 	0
There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists . 	0
Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees . 	1
Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful . 	0
Personally , I agree with this statement . 	0
First , the core of group working is " consensus " . 	1
It ' s the idea that everyone ’ s opinion accounts . 	0
In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . 	0
People who can ’ t accept others ’ criticism can ’ t succeed in group working 	0
In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . 	0
It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . 	0
Therefore , here goes the point that people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working . 	1
In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . 	0
It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . 	0
With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . 	0
Part time job for teenage students 	0
However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . 	0
In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . 	0
The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . 	1
In my view , it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student and this is for two reasons . 	1
For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . 	0
Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . 	0
I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . 	0
As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . 	0
Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
Are museums necessary ? 	0
In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . 	1
However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . 	0
On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . 	1
To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . 	0
What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	0
On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . 	1
A more convenient life in a city 	0
There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . 	0
The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . 	0
However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons . 	1
You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . 	0
For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . 	0
In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings . 	0
The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings . 	0
The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity 	0
As far as I am concerned , we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them . 	1
For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China . 	0
By seeing historic buildings - - whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . 	0
Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	0
If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	0
There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . 	1
If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . 	0
For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . 	0
But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	0
Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . 	1
In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in . 	1
The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . 	0
For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . 	0
I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online . 	1
In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people . 	1
It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . 	0
A single international language or not ? 	0
The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . 	0
Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	1
Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . 	1
As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . 	0
In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . 	0
They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . 	0
Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . 	0
Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus 	0
While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that . 	1
To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . 	0
If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health . 	0
For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . 	0
Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	1
In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
Studying alone or in a group 	0
Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . 	0
Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade 	0
Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . 	0
Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries . 	1
On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . 	0
High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . 	0
Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . 	0
To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	1
In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . 	1
Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . 	0
The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . 	0
But , the break should be an optional thing . 	0
Importantly , the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them . 	1
A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	0
Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition . 	0
Thus , a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies . 	1
One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life . 	0
Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	0
As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . 	0
Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland . 	1
In conclusion , richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade . 	1
Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . 	1
Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	1
For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . 	0
Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . 	0
Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . 	0
If you did , it was probably at a zoo . 	0
Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey ? 	0
Zoos have no useful purpose ? 	0
In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . 	0
When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . 	0
I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction , education , and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding . 	1
A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose . 	0
The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	1
Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . 	0
Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	1
After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . 	0
We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . 	0
Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . 	1
As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . 	0
By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . 	0
During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . 	0
Why are groups or organizations important to people ? 	0
My reasons include the following : In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . 	0
In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals . 	1
Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success 	0
Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success . 	1
First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . 	0
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . 	0
Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . 	1
For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	0
By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . 	0
Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . 	0
For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	0
In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . 	0
As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter “ . 	0
However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . 	0
Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . 	0
Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . 	1
Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . 	0
It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . 	0
Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . 	0
Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . 	0
However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? 	0
I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum . 	0
Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . 	0
As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	0
In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . 	0
They will argue , it can destruct students from their study . 	1
However , as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result ; therefore , i believe part time job will be good for students . 	1
Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future . 	0
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
Some of them had no own savings . 	0
As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
Saving / Spending money 	0
Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . 	0
Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	0
Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	1
Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development . 	1
Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects . 	1
Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . 	0
What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . 	0
For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . 	0
Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . 	1
In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects . 	1
These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	0
For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . 	0
They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . 	0
A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . 	0
By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . 	1
When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . 	0
For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . 	0
Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . 	1
Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	0
Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . 	0
Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . 	0
Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	0
Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . 	0
A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . 	0
Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . 	1
In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . 	0
A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . 	0
Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . 	0
However , a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school . 	1
Is a break good or bad after high school for students 	0
Studies are an essential part of life . 	0
Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . 	0
Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . 	0
Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . 	0
Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . 	1
In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . 	0
In conclusion , being different and unique is the better way to achieve success . 	1
It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success . 	1
It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . 	0
Having job would affect their health , divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life . 	1
Thus , for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies . 	1
Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	1
However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace . 	0
The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves . 	0
However , the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street . 	0
Overall , I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity . 	1
There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities . 	1
This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos . 	0
In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . 	0
Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	0
It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions , but regardless of the condition , zoos are very useful . 	1
Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . 	1
Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	0
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . 	0
For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
Therefore , government should spend money on preservation of old buildings . 	1
There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it ' s gone . 	0
This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance . 	0
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication . 	1
On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage . 	1
Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
Economic development vs environment 	0
From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . 	0
This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . 	0
It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life . 	1
A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . 	0
He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . 	0
If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . 	1
Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling ? 	0
In my opinion , it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students . 	1
Although , many argue that it provide good working experience , but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways . 	1
Having jobs would affect the health of the student . 	1
The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
However , there are also disadvantages . 	0
A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . 	1
When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . 	0
For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . 	0
Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . 	1
It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . 	0
Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . 	0
Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	0
When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . 	0
Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . 	0
Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident . 	0
In conclusion , criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism . 	1
And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	0
You should have your own judgments too ! 	0
Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . 	0
In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . 	1
Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? 	0
What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? 	0
For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	0
For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
In summary , students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education . 	1
Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	1
For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . 	0
In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . 	0
Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . 	0
General education plays a significant role in specialized education . 	0
This might result in limited choices in the future . 	0
They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . 	0
Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . 	0
Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	1
Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . 	0
For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	0
I think , however , students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics . 	1
They believe this motivates students to study . 	0
Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . 	0
High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum 	0
They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . 	0
To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . 	1
In addition , it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles . 	1
I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university . 	1
For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1
To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . 	0
To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . 	1
This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . 	0
Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . 	0
Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . 	1
. 	0
Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	1
Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . 	0
So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them . 	1
Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . 	1
This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	0
I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . 	0
For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . 	0
Moreover , I learn money management . 	0
This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . 	0
From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . 	0
When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . 	0
By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . 	0
I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . 	0
Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
Gun control 	0
For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . 	0
For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds . 	1
The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . 	0
It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	0
The reasons are the followings . 	0
Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them . 	0
Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . 	1
From another point of view , traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban ; so it is out of drivers ' control . 	0
Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour 	0
Started in the late eighteenth century , the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles . 	0
The very fuel that they rely on , oil , has now become the dominant pollution of cities ' environment . 	0
While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts , I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them . 	1
Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? 	0
Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries . 	0
