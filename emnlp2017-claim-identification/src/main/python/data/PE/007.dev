These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	1
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	0
Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . 	0
In my opinion , however , I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment . 	1
In conclusion , young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials . 	1
People will spend less time on cooking food 	0
However , I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food . 	1
The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . 	0
There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . 	0
Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . 	0
As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . 	0
Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life . 	1
Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . 	0
We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . 	0
Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . 	0
Co-operation is essential for teamwork . 	1
However , co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle . 	0
Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . 	0
The modern society is full of cut-throat competition . 	0
Competition or co-operation-which is better 	0
It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . 	0
For instance , lions hunt in a team . 	0
Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future . 	0
This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual . 	1
Thus to conclude , it can be said that when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way . 	1
So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	1
For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . 	0
Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . 	0
Roles of international sports events 	0
To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . 	0
Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food . 	1
When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	1
Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car . 	1
Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . 	1
Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . 	0
There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . 	0
Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . 	1
However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . 	0
Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . 	1
Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	0
Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	0
Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . 	0
Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . 	1
In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . 	0
If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . 	0
Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	1
Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes 	0
There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . 	0
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
To some extent , it is true . 	0
Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . 	0
According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . 	0
Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . 	0
As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . 	0
I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition . 	1
A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	0
Thus , competition and co-operation go hand in hand . 	0
' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . 	0
Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . 	1
This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	0
However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . 	0
They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . 	0
When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier . 	0
Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . 	1
They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	0
Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . 	0
New high school 	0
The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education . 	1
The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community . 	1
Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . 	1
I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community . 	1
Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . 	0
Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . 	0
Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers . 	1
Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects . 	0
Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . 	0
Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . 	0
Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . 	0
Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . 	0
Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	1
And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . 	0
For example in relationships . 	0
Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . 	0
From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . 	0
To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . 	1
Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . 	0
Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children , otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time . 	0
In my point of view , both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children . 	1
Children should studying hard or playing sport ? 	0
Both can improve their future 	0
Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . 	1
Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . 	0
People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time 	0
Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life , for several reasons . 	1
Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . 	0
Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . 	0
I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . 	0
Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
Use of CCTV cameras 	0
It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	0
As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
Internet facilities such as msn , skype made visual communication possible . 	0
For example , via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends , but also make interviews for employment , enrolment into universities . 	0
With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes . 	0
In addition , it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office , but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends , family members in any part of the world . 	0
In result , communication has become cheaper , faster and visual . 	1
Finally , I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick , a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways . 	1
To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	1
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
I believe that experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice . 	1
Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ? 	0
For one thing , there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself . 	0
For example , a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous . 	0
If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely . 	0
In addition , family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time . 	0
You will grow to be dependent and reliant . 	0
In contrast , free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose . 	0
According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . 	0
It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable . 	0
What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . 	0
There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . 	0
First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . 	0
The reasons are based on the following aspects . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . 	0
Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	0
Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? 	0
Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . 	0
By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things . 	0
On the other hand , finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature . 	1
Therefore , learning about life , which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed . 	0
Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience . 	0
The best way of learning life 	0
Life is full of challenges , difficulties and unexpected obstacles . 	0
Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life . 	0
And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not . 	0
Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages . 	0
On one hand , the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter . 	1
They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . 	0
Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . 	0
For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . 	0
To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . 	0
Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	1
Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . 	0
These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . 	0
Young people move to cities 	0
To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . 	0
Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this . 	0
However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . 	0
For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	0
As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . 	1
To sum up , this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying . 	1
The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	0
So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment . 	1
The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate , but I think that it isn ' t a big deal . 	1
For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . 	0
After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . 	0
The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . 	0
This will increase the social connections of the students . 	0
Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process . 	1
Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	0
It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future . 	0
Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . 	0
The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . 	0
The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . 	0
To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . 	1
Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . 	1
There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	0
Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . 	0
Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? 	0
From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress . 	1
In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . 	0
Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . 	0
That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . 	0
Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being . 	0
In conclusion , both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children ' s future . 	1
At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . 	1
There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . 	0
Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . 	0
Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . 	0
This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	0
I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . 	0
As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power . 	1
The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . 	0
The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy 	0
Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . 	1
If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	0
Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . 	0
First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . 	1
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities . 	0
Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . 	0
This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	0
Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	1
In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	0
Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . 	0
Government and education 	0
Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . 	1
I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees . 	1
It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	0
In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . 	1
They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . 	1
Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . 	0
For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . 	0
In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . 	1
Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	0
My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . 	0
Furthermore , they are more flexible . 	0
If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	0
He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . 	0
If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . 	0
Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . 	0
There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . 	0
They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . 	0
For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . 	0
Competition helps in improvement and evolution . 	1
Competition has helped the development of science and technology . 	0
An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . 	0
Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . 	0
However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	0
A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . 	0
It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . 	0
Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . 	1
In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	0
To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
In conclusion , I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them . 	1
For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . 	0
Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . 	0
First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . 	1
This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors . 	0
It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth . 	1
These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . 	0
Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . 	0
Effect of celebrities on youth 	0
Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . 	0
This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	0
For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . 	0
Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . 	0
Teachers could augment their quality . 	0
Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . 	1
Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . 	0
Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . 	0
Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . 	1
Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	0
In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance . 	1
As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	0
First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
Hence , with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information , and can get it from different sources . 	0
Second , in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster , visual and cheaper . 	0
Computers have made life easier 	0
The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology . 	0
While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful , others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient . 	0
In my point of view , computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication . 	1
First , computers through internet made our access to information easier . 	1
Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly , store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed . 	0
Search engines such as google , yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes . 	0
Social networks such as facebook , twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments . 	0
Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	0
To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . 	1
Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it . 	1
In conclusion , the good technology bringing to us is undeniable . 	1
Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . 	0
In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . 	0
Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . 	0
In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	0
People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society . 	1
For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . 	0
On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . 	0
Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	0
Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes . 	1
Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	0
Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . 	0
Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture . 	1
Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism . 	1
Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . 	0
Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? 	0
Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons . 	0
However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . 	0
About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . 	0
In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . 	0
Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	1
Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . 	0
With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . 	0
Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . 	1
In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . 	0
Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . 	0
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
Living in a higher pace is better 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0
However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . 	0
To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages . 	1
Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . 	1
Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . 	0
Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes . 	0
Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	0
However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . 	0
In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . 	0
But to me , learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate . 	1
In summary , each way learning life has its own benefits . 	0
All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	0
With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . 	0
According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . 	0
Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . 	1
In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	0
Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . 	0
It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . 	0
Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . 	1
For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . 	0
On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . 	1
I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates . 	1
International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding 	0
Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . 	0
There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . 	1
Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . 	0
Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . 	0
Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	0
For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . 	0
