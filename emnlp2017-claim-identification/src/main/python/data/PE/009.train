Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	1
In conclusion , " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers . 	1
Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . 	0
In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . 	0
Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . 	0
Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . 	1
Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . 	0
Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . 	1
Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational . 	1
Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . 	0
Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . 	1
In my opinion , all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved . 	1
There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . 	0
Old buildings should be preserved 	0
The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . 	0
Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	0
Old buildings are an essential part of history . 	0
As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . 	0
Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . 	1
Developing globalization , people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world . 	0
For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school . 	1
During the history of the world , every change has its own positive and negative sides . 	0
However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . 	0
They have the life of a person at their discretion . 	0
They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . 	1
The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . 	0
When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . 	0
Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	1
Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . 	0
Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	1
For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . 	0
Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	0
Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more . 	1
In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages . 	1
In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together . 	1
Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . 	0
Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . 	1
As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	0
Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . 	0
These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology . 	0
Traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever 	0
Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated . 	0
It is evident that technology promotes economy . 	0
First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture . 	1
I totally disagree this opinion . 	0
Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence . 	0
They make differences between countries . 	0
For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries . 	0
Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions . 	0
Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . 	0
A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . 	0
There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	0
Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . 	1
And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . 	0
In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . 	0
To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
Finally , a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented . 	1
As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks . 	0
By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth . 	0
With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming . 	0
As a conclusion , I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space . 	1
In spite of costing a fortune , space exploration has given aforementioned benefits . 	0
Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater . 	0
Moreover , spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society . 	0
In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head . 	0
Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs . 	0
It will help people around the world understand each other more . 	0
Since , international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
When many people congregate in one place , I think that some kinds of social problems will follow . 	0
International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion . 	0
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	0
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	1
Moreover , when people have jobs , they will have money to spend on goods and services . 	0
For the time of occasions , people regardless of nationality , origin and religion will live together . 	0
It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away . 	0
Besides , advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle . 	1
We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles . 	0
Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . 	0
Which one is the promising way to succeed ? 	0
As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . 	0
Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	0
Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . 	0
Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . 	0
Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . 	0
For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . 	0
First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . 	0
Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . 	1
Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments . 	0
It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment . 	1
Prevention is better than cure 	0
It is are easy and usable . 	1
In my point of view , listening to music , exercising , and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress . 	1
In conclusion , there are many ways to reduce the stress . 	0
These could relieve me from stress . 	0
A way to do meditation is that I just sit down , close my eyes , and count my breath . 	0
Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment , and it take few minutes . 	0
when I have many things to think about , and this make me stress , I will do meditation . 	0
Third , meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress . 	1
And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind . 	1
The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists . 	0
For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . 	0
In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry . 	1
In addition , sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation . 	0
Funding artists 	0
Nowadays , in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country , every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely . 	0
Therefore , there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists , but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space . 	0
In my view , I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons . 	0
Therefore , culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art . 	1
Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts . 	0
With the rapid development of the standard of people ' s life , increasing numbers of animal experiments are done , new medicines and foods , for instance . 	0
Using animals for the benefit of the human beings 	0
In my essay , I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects . 	0
Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature , however , I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals . 	1
The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals . 	0
First of all , as we all know , animals are friendly and vital for people , because if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well . 	0
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance , it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life . 	0
In other words , doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation . 	1
The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life . 	0
To begin with , it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying . 	1
If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing . 	0
After all , you spend most of your day at office . 	0
This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships . 	0
Finally , the co-workers should believe in fellowship . 	1
there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . 	0
In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . 	0
If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . 	0
We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . 	0
Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . 	0
Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . 	1
Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	1
Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . 	0
It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . 	0
This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . 	0
It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . 	0
Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? 	0
Based on the above discussion , I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem . 	1
Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . 	1
It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . 	0
The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . 	0
Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . 	1
In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	0
Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . 	0
On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . 	0
Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear . 	1
It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . 	0
Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? 	0
First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . 	0
On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . 	1
However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	0
Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . 	1
Therefore , instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create . 	1
It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . 	0
There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . 	0
By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . 	1
For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	0
Children can effectively learn from watching television 	0
TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . 	0
But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth . 	1
If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study . 	1
Technology has made life too easy for most children . 	0
But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . 	1
For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . 	0
Nonetheless , passion on jobs , in my opinion , can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on . 	1
In conclusion , it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers . 	1
Finally , some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies . 	0
Besides , important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated . 	0
Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective . 	0
Human life today can ' t be imagined without computers , so not depending on them is out of question . 	0
Thus , dependence on computers is not a bad thing . 	1
However , one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things . 	0
The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful . 	0
Nevertheless , with all the mentioned demerits , computers have provided security and sophistication too . 	1
They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook ) . 	0
Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives . 	0
We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	0
It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life . 	0
As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time . 	1
What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles . 	1
From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path . 	1
To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc . People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end . 	0
For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives . 	0
However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case . 	0
Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons 	0
There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success . 	0
Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens . 	0
Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way . 	0
What is more , the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species . 	0
Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory . 	0
In sum , the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable . 	1
It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency . 	0
A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university . 	0
For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . 	0
I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . 	0
Thus , many people try to reduce their stress . 	0
There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress . 	0
in my opinion , reducing stress by listening to music , playing sports , and doing meditation are easy and practical ways . 	1
First of all , listening to music is a great way to relax . 	1
Best ways of reducing stress : listening to music , exercise , meditation 	0
Nowadays , we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated . 	0
Everything seem to be rush , and it have a lot of competition . 	0
These make people get stress . 	0
Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . 	0
Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . 	0
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field 	0
In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . 	0
For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . 	1
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . 	0
Thus , in my point of view , although it will take some time on it , high school students should take a course on basic economics . 	1
Let me explain it in detail . 	0
That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . 	0
Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	0
The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
To conclude , Earth is our home and it should be protected . 	1
Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . 	0
Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life . 	0
To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	0
Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . 	1
For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . 	0
Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	0
Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	1
Also , we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students . 	0
Next , students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades . 	0
As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams . 	0
Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights . 	0
First of all , as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study . 	1
In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice , to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude . 	1
High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in . 	0
Educated high-school students with bright and independent mind 	0
Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit . 	1
For example , when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other . 	0
Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea . 	0
Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . 	0
Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . 	0
Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . 	0
Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	0
The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . 	0
In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . 	1
Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors . 	0
But from my experience , I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit . 	1
Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors . 	0
People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities . 	0
One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . 	1
For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . 	0
Also , outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty . 	1
There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . 	0
Obviously , it is waste of time . 	0
Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	0
People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition . 	0
Therefore , lives in the old days is easier than today . 	1
All in all , I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world . 	1
They must take only a bus to go to another place . 	0
If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . 	0
For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . 	0
On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . 	0
Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly . 	1
Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . 	0
It is absolutely a major problem . 	0
For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . 	0
Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	0
Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . 	1
Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this . 	0
Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives 	0
Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society . 	0
Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits . 	1
For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans . 	0
First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more . 	0
Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits . 	1
From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support . 	0
However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . 	0
Children should grow up in a big city ! 	0
Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind . 	1
Doing all jobs at home don ' t make employees attempt to work like this . 	1
Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience , but i don ' t . 	0
Computers have made it possible for office workers to do their work 	0
Then again , the workers must try their best to finish the time limit . 	0
The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects . 	0
Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible . 	0
Pressure is motivation . 	0
I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . 	0
He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . 	0
Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . 	0
In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . 	0
The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . 	0
Benefits of students ' unpaid work 	0
To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . 	1
In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end . 	0
As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . 	0
In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . 	0
As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . 	0
For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	0
I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . 	0
For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . 	0
Although there are valid arguments to the contrary , it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication . 	1
Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . 	0
With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . 	0
To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . 	0
With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . 	0
Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . 	0
Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	1
If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . 	0
They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . 	0
He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . 	0
For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . 	0
Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . 	1
However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	0
To sum up , although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest , I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest . 	1
Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art . 	0
I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings , but , with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs . 	0
Finally , conservation leads us to a higher standard of living . 	1
Consideration is always important in relationship . 	0
In the meantime , communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate . 	1
Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine . 	0
For example , roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time . 	0
Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school . 	0
Roommates quality and their importance 	0
In my personal opinion , the most important quality of roommates is being considered . 	1
Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate . 	0
Instead , he hardly cared about something else . 	0
For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . 	0
Therefore , having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life . 	1
At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously . 	0
Although , they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do , but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team . 	1
If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves . 	0
Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way . 	0
Lastly , learning in classroom , student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body . 	1
This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes . 	0
On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . 	0
For instance , In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group . 	0
Secondly , online class could not provide knowledge about social skills . 	1
Unlike classroom , online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation . 	0
First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . 	1
From this point of view , I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education . 	1
During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . 	0
What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . 	0
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . 	0
Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? 	0
In conclusion , I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class . 	1
This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide . 	0
If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	0
Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . 	0
In my opinion , however , I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment . 	1
In conclusion , young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials . 	1
There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . 	0
Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . 	0
Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . 	0
With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency . 	0
Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning . 	0
In addition , being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life . 	1
Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently . 	0
By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching . 	0
This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic . 	0
Secondly , some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook . 	1
Secondly , animals are kept in unnatural conditions . 	0
Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money , since they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances . 	0
Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result . 	0
This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . 	0
Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . 	1
I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared . 	1
The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . 	0
It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
Languages ' extinction , discuss both views 	0
Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	1
For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . 	0
Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . 	0
There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . 	1
Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals ' rights today is animal experimentation . 	0
The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working . 	0
However , the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people . 	1
For another , using machines can save company ' s money . 	0
Because machines never ask for salary , over-time pay or pension , so employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare . 	0
For one thing , machines are more effective than human . 	0
Not like human , machines do not need rest , which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes . 	0
In my opinion , although using machines have many benefits , we cannot ignore its negative effects . 	1
It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits . 	1
Advantages and disadvantages of machines instead of human to do the work 	0
The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people . 	0
For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	0
More power than any friend or other adult could have . 	0
They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	0
Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . 	1
I completely agree that parents are the best teacher . 	1
Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else 	0
Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . 	1
Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children ’ s lives . 	1
That ’ s as important thing because even if the parents don ’ t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . 	0
Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . 	1
Moreover , parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children ' s future life . 	1
It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person . 	1
He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . 	0
They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . 	0
Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	0
In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . 	0
They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . 	0
This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . 	0
Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . 	1
If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . 	0
They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . 	0
Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	1
Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
If you want to stay healthy , be yourself and spend time with your family and friends , then you should spend less time watching these media . 	0
Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . 	0
These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images . 	1
They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies . 	0
When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together . 	0
When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don ’ t prefer it . 	0
I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people ’ s behavior in bad ways . 	1
When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly . 	0
Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body . 	0
As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others . 	0
However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax . 	1
Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well-being of the whole society . 	0
The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers . 	0
For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment . 	0
To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens . 	1
Personally , I tend to disagree with this view . 	0
Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that . 	0
Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country . 	0
Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens 	0
In conclusion , it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement . 	1
There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . 	0
Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . 	0
Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	0
Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	1
Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . 	1
Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . 	0
Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . 	0
Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . 	0
To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . 	0
As a mass media majoring student , I think that it ' s true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society . 	1
Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media 	0
My reasons include the following : It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . 	1
In my point of view , disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages . 	1
However , journalism is changing . 	0
The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . 	0
First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . 	1
Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	0
Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	0
The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . 	0
In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful . 	1
I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown . 	1
Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on . 	0
Staying in one place is better than moving number of places 	0
If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . 	1
Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . 	0
In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . 	0
I was born and grew up in here , a small town . 	0
I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . 	1
Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	0
Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
I believe that they are important somehow , but not essential . 	1
However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . 	0
On the other side , if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position , it ' s fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss , only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss ' s eyes , he will be more possible to enhance position . 	1
Consequently , make a good relationship with them . 	1
Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . 	1
For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	0
To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned , good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons . 	0
Ability to Relate Well to people Vs Studying Hard 	0
First of all , friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career . 	0
However , if one coniders the issue carefully , he or she may agree the title statement as I do . 	0
Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields , imagine when you are in trouble , you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you , so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible , even an esy phone call , instend of a series of complex solutions . 	0
Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job . 	1
If top-level managers want to make a project successful , have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers ' work complete successfully , managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job , pay much patiant and care to them . 	0
Futuermore , no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company , relating well to people is also a importent issue . 	0
In conclusion , although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial , it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages . 	1
Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . 	0
Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . 	0
This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . 	0
Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . 	0
Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	1
Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services 	0
As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . 	0
As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . 	0
However , from my perspective , I think arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well . 	1
On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . 	1
Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . 	0
On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . 	0
Specifically , price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ; however , whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated . 	0
On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . 	0
Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . 	1
As we read newspapers or watch TV , we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues , air and water pollution questions . 	0
Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices 	0
As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching , it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems , though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society . 	1
Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems . 	0
As illustrated before , several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems . 	1
In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours . 	0
In short , I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world , creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in . 	1
It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . 	0
Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . 	0
According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . 	0
Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . 	1
First , under globalization and industrial integration , the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging . 	1
The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world . 	0
Some people believe that little things changed through generation , while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation . 	1
Challenges are different from generation to generation 	0
While debating about generation issues , people always have different opinions . 	0
If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . 	0
Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . 	0
Second , learning abilities in each students is different . 	0
If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	0
Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . 	0
It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . 	0
This problems depend on how hard study they do . 	0
Therefore , testing result are different . 	0
Still , I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	1
In other words , students can procure more advantages from better facilities . 	1
Based on the reasons demonstrate above , I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other . 	1
It is not teachers fault . 	0
No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . 	0
It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . 	0
According to statistics , 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet . 	0
Further , by means of some communication tools , it has become very easy to make new friends . 	0
However , the other side of the coin is that , by communicating via Internet or phone , we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully , because during such conversations , some of our words can make a completely different sense . 	0
In this sense , Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends . 	1
By way of conclusion , I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable . 	1
As a result , the rate of divorces is increasing day by day . 	1
For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . 	0
Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . 	0
Therefore , I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students . 	1
To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . 	1
Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . 	0
According to my opinion , because it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice . 	1
Going to classes should be optional for the students 	0
University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . 	0
It was waste of the time . 	0
Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . 	1
Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market . 	0
Also , overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness . 	0
Life in Big Cities Vs People ' s health 	0
Today , more and more people are moving to big cities to live . 	0
However , while life in those cities is good in some ways , I completely argue that people ' s health would therefore be affected negatively . 	1
Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before . 	1
Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases . 	0
Besides , water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical . 	0
The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time . 	0
Moreover , it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink . 	1
They are essential to our spiritual life . 	0
They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way . 	0
Second , music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing . 	0
Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination . 	0
If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much . 	0
In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like . 	0
However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them . 	1
Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure . 	1
In this way , it will not be such pressure on children . 	0
In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills . 	0
Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside . 	1
Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth . 	0
However , the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now . 	0
They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away . 	0
Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems . 	0
Second , the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues . 	1
The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator , since the rising sea water could drown them . 	0
Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together . 	0
In conclusion , environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence . 	1
It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages . 	0
Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
Furthermore , it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing . 	0
Thus even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines . 	0
To sum up , I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals ' profits , the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits . 	1
Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication , they also contribute to some social problems . 	1
Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . 	0
Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed . 	1
For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat " , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . 	0
With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . 	0
Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars , and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities . 	0
In conclusion , although technological progress causes corresponding problems , it still provides us with much more advantages . 	1
People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas , and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions . 	0
This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment . 	0
In conclusion , I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly . 	1
In conclusion , students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes . 	1
Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	0
I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . 	0
However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . 	0
Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? 	0
Why wasting time going to classes ? 	0
Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . 	1
Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	0
In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . 	1
Many professors grade their students with class attendances . 	0
Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life 	0
Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working . 	0
From my perspective , those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date . 	0
In the modern world , computers are used everywhere . 	0
First and foremost , various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish . 	1
Ever since Charles Babbage ( know as " Father of computers " ) invented computers , its development never had a pause . 	0
Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life . 	0
Therefore , the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards . 	0
More importantly , they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly . 	0
These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not . 	0
But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks . 	0
For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months . 	0
Thus , easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health . 	1
After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone . 	0
So , I was quite aggressive , however . 	0
In addition , Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses . 	1
Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects . 	0
Also , there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea . 	0
We can study subjects through EBS lecture . 	0
As an example , I got too much stress from the school . 	0
When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses . 	0
Many children have a lot of stresses recently , since they have so much pressure about study . 	0
There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . 	0
However , I believe their concern is groundless . 	0
Instead , technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles . 	0
Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not ? 	0
Living in the 21st century , people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity . 	0
Thus , every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years , regardless of any potential problems it may bring about . 	0
Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	0
This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills . 	0
However , with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere . 	0
Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives . 	1
In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination . 	0
In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days . 	0
It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults . 	1
Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most . 	1
There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . 	0
Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . 	0
Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . 	1
Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered . 	0
In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity . 	1
As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	1
Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . 	0
In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . 	0
Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance . 	0
As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever . 	0
Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education . 	0
The Internet is an adequate source of academic information 	0
Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . 	0
This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . 	0
Personally , I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning . 	1
However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists . 	0
Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace . 	0
First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils . 	1
It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home . 	1
Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	0
In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency . 	1
It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . 	0
In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . 	0
Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . 	1
For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . 	0
Thus , I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers . 	1
It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . 	0
For another example , if one ’ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office . 	1
First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . 	1
They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . 	0
Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . 	0
Working at home vs Working in a company 	0
Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . 	0
People are no longer restricted in the office . 	0
This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . 	0
Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life . 	1
Personally , I agree with this statement . 	0
First , the core of group working is " consensus " . 	1
It ' s the idea that everyone ’ s opinion accounts . 	0
In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . 	0
People who can ’ t accept others ’ criticism can ’ t succeed in group working 	0
In everyday life we encounter different people , and we receive different opinions about us or our works , no matter positive or negative . 	0
It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism . 	0
Therefore , here goes the point that people who can ' t accept others ' criticism can ' t succeed in group working . 	1
In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . 	0
It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his / her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . 	0
The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
How to learn children more efficiently 	0
The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society , especially in high level such as college or university . 	0
Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
Some people argue that this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' , but actually it gives no harm to the whole community . 	0
Secondly , university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes . 	1
I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age , due to reasons that I stated below . 	1
From my perspective , the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons . 	1
Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . 	0
The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation . 	0
Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important 	0
Most importantly , there are many accidents happening on the roads . 	0
Moreover , the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing . 	0
The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia . 	0
First and foremost , we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents . 	1
Each year , Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan . 	0
For example , in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents . 	0
It ’ s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city . 	1
Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly 	0
With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . 	0
People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . 	0
Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals . 	0
These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent . 	1
First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . 	1
For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . 	0
On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	0
At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . 	1
People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . 	0
In conclusion , International sporting events will draw the international concern . 	1
Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world . 	0
It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . 	0
In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . 	0
Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . 	0
Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation . 	0
From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits . 	1
If I have to choose , I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment . 	1
I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life . 	1
Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills . 	0
In contrast , some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety . 	0
" Pen and Paper " Examination 	0
Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world . 	0
At virtually every stage of the learning process , exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage . 	0
However , many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered . 	0
There are clearly advantages to exams . 	1
They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates . 	0
They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple-choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability . 	0
However , exams also have some drawbacks . 	1
What is more , the factory is not isolated , other industries and business will be quickly established , resulting in economic growth of local area . 	0
To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit . 	0
However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution . 	0
Out of the case of economic development , industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society . 	0
Nowadays , whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society . 	0
Influence of large factories 	0
Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . 	0
My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . 	0
Because most people they contact with are also students . 	0
First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . 	0
So , they can teach students many things about adult life . 	1
However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . 	0
Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . 	0
The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it 	0
There are some reasons can support my view . 	0
If students want to get used to the society quickly , it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs . 	1
To conclude , I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life . 	1
Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	0
In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . 	0
Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . 	0
In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . 	0
I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . 	0
Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . 	1
It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . 	0
In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides . 	0
Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . 	0
Should high school make music lessons compulsory 	0
I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . 	0
For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . 	0
Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . 	1
Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality . 	1
Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . 	0
At school or university , success depends on how we study . 	0
Everyone has their method to success in life . 	0
Some students prefer to study alone 	0
In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	0
Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . 	0
Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want , In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons , because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood . 	1
Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	1
For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . 	0
However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . 	0
The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . 	0
Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . 	1
While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures , I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable , it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture . 	1
Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life . 	0
Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways 	0
Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . 	0
However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . 	1
Besides , when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer . 	1
For example , when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation . 	0
Physical exercises help to create healthy nation , assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country . 	1
First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : " Anima sana in corpore sano " , which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul . 	0
Physical exercise 	0
Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics , I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed . 	1
Additionally , there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better . 	0
So , if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation . 	1
There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises . 	0
The more we practice , the better we feel . 	0
It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old . 	1
By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life . 	1
They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	0
Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . 	0
With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	0
Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . 	1
Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . 	0
For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . 	0
Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . 	0
Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . 	0
We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject 	0
There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . 	0
Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students . 	1
On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . 	1
Nonetheless , innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience . 	1
It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments . 	0
Hence , creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions . 	1
Time and again , creative artists like Michaelangelo , Picasso , Salman Rushdie , Shakespeare etc . have made artistic works which gave a social message . 	0
Right from sculptures to paintings , books to drama and movies , all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras . 	0
Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message . 	1
Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions 	0
Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious . 	0
Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds . 	0
Creativity originates in a free mind . 	1
Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . 	0
However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . 	0
They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . 	0
Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	1
Celebrities & Their Influences 	0
Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . 	0
To some extent , I do not agree with this statement . 	0
First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . 	1
Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . 	0
We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . 	0
When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . 	0
Part time job for teenage students 	0
However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . 	0
In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . 	0
The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . 	1
In my view , it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student and this is for two reasons . 	1
For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . 	0
Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . 	0
I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . 	0
As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . 	0
Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
Who would the employer choose , an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . 	0
Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . 	1
However , in my point of view , it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company . 	1
All in a nutshell , workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects . 	1
Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace . 	0
There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution . 	0
To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis . 	1
Are museums necessary ? 	0
Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy . 	0
For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand . 	0
Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history . 	1
The last thing is about education . 	0
Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability . 	0
In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology . 	1
Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method . 	0
In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more . 	0
After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life . 	0
Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations . 	0
In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . 	1
Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . 	0
Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities . 	1
From all analysis suggested above , professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions . 	1
I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation . 	0
Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . 	0
It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . 	0
While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . 	0
They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . 	0
All in all , the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance . 	1
She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . 	0
One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . 	0
The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . 	0
The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	0
An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . 	0
The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . 	0
Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . 	0
Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . 	1
Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail 	0
When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication . 	1
Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . 	0
Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . 	0
However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . 	0
However , reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment . 	1
In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	0
As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . 	1
When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . 	0
For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . 	0
Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . 	0
Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future . 	0
This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual . 	1
Thus to conclude , it can be said that when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way . 	1
So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	1
For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . 	0
Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . 	0
First of all , many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones . 	1
Despite all these positive aspects , I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development . 	1
Nowadays , many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends . 	0
Popularity of mobile phones to young people 	0
I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends . 	0
In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone . 	0
Similarly , internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works . 	0
Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities . 	0
Secondly , juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic . 	1
That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester . 	0
However , a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters . 	0
If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	0
In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . 	0
All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those . 	0
In a nutshell , I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible . 	1
Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . 	0
On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . 	1
These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . 	0
As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . 	0
Roles of international sports events 	0
Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
Third , it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children . 	0
Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? 	0
It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . 	0
This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . 	0
From my point of view , I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study . 	1
In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . 	0
Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . 	0
Imagine an actor who is a child ’ s favorite is doing violent roles . 	0
Therefore , female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men . 	1
Automatically , the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people . 	1
Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . 	0
I strongly agree about this statement . 	0
The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently . 	0
Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held . 	0
Nowadays , there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course . 	1
The gender issue for getting education needs 	0
The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources . 	0
As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
In conclusion , parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice . 	1
Based on love , they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children ' s future life . 	0
I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail . 	0
I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems . 	0
Firstly , communicating by e-mail is easy . 	1
There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay . 	0
Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face , personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better . 	1
Communicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face 	0
As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day . 	0
Secondly , you can write an e-mail at any time of the day . 	1
In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident . 	0
Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with . 	0
Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends . 	0
Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying . 	1
Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class . 	0
Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas . 	0
Although , online classes have many advantages , for me , I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons . 	1
First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying . 	1
Almost every school develops their online class systems . 	0
One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning . 	0
Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom 	0
During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society . 	0
This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming . 	1
Further , government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy . 	0
In the same way , the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution . 	0
To conclude , it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy . 	1
Secondly , the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming . 	1
For example , the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming . 	0
After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens . 	0
At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . 	0
Personally , I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help . 	1
Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	0
In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . 	1
In this case , the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company . 	0
Secondly , employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained . 	1
Clearly , in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc . Therefore , we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge . 	1
Firstly , training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind . 	0
My arguments for this point are listed follows . 	0
Besides the methods , from my point of view , providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work . 	0
Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways 	0
For another thing , employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity . 	0
So obviously , they will think about develop long term career with their company . 	0
Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair . 	0
What is more , when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager . 	1
You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it . 	0
In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss . 	0
In the first place , there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others . 	1
There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others . 	0
Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages , I would prefer to work for myself , and have my own business . 	1
Some of them are done by companies that related to government , and some of them are done by privat companies . 	0
There are many kinds of jobs in society . 	0
Some prefer to work for a company , some prefer to work for themselves 	0
On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area . 	1
To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace . 	0
What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city . 	0
On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town . 	1
A more convenient life in a city 	0
There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town . 	0
The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live . 	0
However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons . 	1
You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities . 	0
For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising . 	0
It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . 	0
Living and studying overseas 	0
There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home . 	1
Interaction is a factor increasing working quality . 	0
Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	0
First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . 	1
One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . 	0
Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . 	1
Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . 	0
Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	0
The dos and don ' t at office play important role to prevent these things from workers . 	0
Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites , however , they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job . 	0
Besides , interaction help employees improve their communicational skills , therefore , they will have more and more friends and relationships . 	0
Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people . 	0
Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices . 	1
The best condition might not be good for people . 	0
Everyone has happy moments during their life . 	0
School memories 	0
In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life . 	1
These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood . 	0
They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future . 	0
First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood . 	1
A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . 	0
They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy . 	0
Firstly , many facts about solar system can be discovered . 	1
Therefore , it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it . 	1
This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	0
The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . 	0
Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . 	0
Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . 	1
At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	0
This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . 	0
It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health . 	0
To conclude , smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior . 	1
However , the current cost of medicines is , in fact , reasonable and based on the medicines ' effectiveness . 	1
Apparently , the process of researching , testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money . 	0
It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour . 	0
For instance , I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home . 	0
Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads . 	0
Secondly , investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work . 	1
Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried . 	0
All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes . 	0
Last but not least , spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality . 	1
In contrast , if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions . 	0
What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier . 	0
We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities . 	0
In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
So that , I disagree with this notion . 	0
Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer , as they may be false , may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes . 	1
Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions . 	0
Everyone is different . 	0
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . 	0
Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . 	0
Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . 	1
In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . 	0
Knowledge is the base of creativity . 	0
The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things . 	1
However , with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends . 	0
Therefore , they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking . 	0
Second , technology widen children ' s knowledge . 	0
In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective . 	0
In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight . 	0
However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole . 	0
In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . 	0
At this point , newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive . 	1
This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today . 	0
Last , but not least , when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down . 	0
For this reason , the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time . 	1
The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so . 	0
The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? 	0
It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries . 	0
On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . 	0
Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . 	0
They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . 	0
On the whole , I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in . 	1
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . 	0
That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	0
Considering all those factors above , I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary . 	1
It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . 	0
When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	0
Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . 	0
Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . 	1
Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . 	0
They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . 	1
For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . 	0
Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . 	0
I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice . 	0
Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages . 	1
To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky . 	1
Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money . 	0
It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation . 	0
Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . 	0
First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . 	0
This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . 	0
For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . 	0
Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . 	0
Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places 	0
In this case , I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health . 	1
However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . 	0
Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
Nonetheless , its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
In conclusion , I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization . 	1
We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life . 	1
This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously . 	0
Last but not least , technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements . 	1
Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors . 	0
Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . 	0
However , using computer can make people easier to complete their work . 	1
As it can be seen from the example , the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected . 	0
A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to , due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working . 	0
I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people . 	1
However , I strongly believe that computer can influence society , and people ' s lives have already been controlled by device . 	1
Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing , and they cannot do anything without that device . 	0
However , many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life . 	0
People use computer particularly for work , study , even for communication . 	0
Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life . 	0
Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use 	0
On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . 	0
As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	1
To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . 	0
Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car . 	1
At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . 	1
From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	0
Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . 	0
Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . 	0
Students need to work as part time basis . 	0
Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . 	1
Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . 	1
For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . 	0
However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . 	1
When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	0
To my view , I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs . 	1
Yet , the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others . 	1
Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . 	0
Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	0
Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . 	0
Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . 	0
On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . 	1
It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . 	0
Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . 	1
It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . 	0
Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . 	0
Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	0
Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs 	0
With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . 	0
However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . 	0
The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion . 	0
Therefore , requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them . 	1
People can understand more about a country , it is useful to ease tensions between nations . 	0
In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
Sense of cooperation 	0
A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . 	1
Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . 	0
What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	0
There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . 	0
It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . 	0
Several languages are in danger of extinction 	0
But the others do not believe it is possible . 	0
Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . 	0
First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . 	0
In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue . 	0
The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . 	0
It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . 	0
If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future . 	0
Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments . 	1
To conclude , I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments . 	1
Another debatable problem is about techniques . 	0
It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed . 	0
This possibility exists all the time . 	0
There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party . 	1
Moreover , the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life . 	1
But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users . 	0
In conclusion , nothing can be overused without side effects . 	0
Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth . 	0
The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people ' s dependence on it is irreversible , although it has a number of problems that should be well handled . 	1
I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . 	0
The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	0
People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . 	0
And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	0
In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . 	1
Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . 	0
First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . 	1
Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . 	0
If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . 	0
There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . 	0
Luck vs hard work 	0
Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target . 	1
However , I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals . 	1
Hence , I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work . 	1
Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies , but doing so can bring us a healthy body , a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness . 	1
Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester . 	0
However , research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule . 	0
So other several , prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically . 	0
Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning . 	0
Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules . 	0
One long vacation or several long vacation 	0
Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure . 	0
Firstly , several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low . 	1
However , i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics . 	1
In both the scenario students relief themselves . 	0
However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . 	0
Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . 	1
Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . 	0
The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . 	0
Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	1
The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . 	0
Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success . 	1
Firstly , education is an essential part in development . 	0
This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters . 	0
A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want , even though it is not the real needs of the society . 	1
And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it . 	0
However , buying habit is a very personal things for individuals , the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy , sometimes it depends on one ' s needs and ability of consumption . 	1
It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income . 	0
Advertising impact on people ' s choice of consumption 	0
Nowdays , people ' s choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television , street , magazine etc . This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life . 	1
For example , in most asian countries , advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales , and some people , especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs . 	0
In addition , products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement , people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought . 	0
For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . 	0
Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase . 	0
On the other hand , children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not , since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary . 	1
Therefore , it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs . 	0
For example , not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot . 	0
Furthermore , putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them . 	0
Instead , the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government . 	0
To summarize , I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities , because the former is more essential , non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens . 	1
That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support , because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis . 	1
Admittedly , the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest . 	0
Apparently , this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art . 	0
Thus , the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure . 	1
The education of art and music would not work if students resist it . 	0
Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life . 	0
Obviously , with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself . 	0
At this moment , they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved . 	0
When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for . 	0
In a nutshell , in the modern society , since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure , younger students ' art and music education should not take the second place . 	1
It helps animals out of extinction . 	1
It is very crucial for learning . 	1
First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . 	1
Also , it is a interesting travel location . 	1
Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . 	0
Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose 	0
I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings . 	1
However , I do not agree with them . 	0
Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . 	0
When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? 	0
In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers . 	0
Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development . 	0
If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice . 	0
There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring . 	1
If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals . 	0
For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones . 	0
But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs . 	0
Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information . 	1
In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in . 	1
In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents . 	0
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
Should we require our young children to learn music and art 	0
Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules . 	0
Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination . 	0
First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young . 	1
In my opinion , I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them . 	1
With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one ' s career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does , and higher income can be the basis of a happier , healthier life . 	1
Furthermore , it ' s undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it ' s big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities . 	0
Finally , although I prefer to live in a big city , I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste , to be clear , I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress . 	1
In my opinion , life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons . 	1
Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	0
Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . 	0
Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . 	0
For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . 	0
However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . 	0
Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . 	0
Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . 	0
Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . 	1
Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . 	1
Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . 	1
I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled . 	0
I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many . 	1
Looking from another perspective , written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages . 	1
With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images . 	0
Nonetheless , this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about . 	0
Furthermore , the primary way of educating students is also by this way . 	0
Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better . 	0
To conclude , both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect , either images or words . 	1
Hence , for a more meaningful communication , these two elements have their respective roles to play : image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject . 	0
When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . 	0
For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . 	0
While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . 	0
For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . 	0
To avoid being a pessimist , we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families , doing exercise regularly , and trying to see our troubles in a different way . 	0
Last but not least , corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors . 	0
For the reasons mentioned above , I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves . 	1
I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online . 	1
Consequently , it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body . 	1
North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one . 	0
For example , robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies . 	0
Thus many people ' s jobs are now at high stake . 	0
The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs . 	1
Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . 	0
Prepared Food 	0
Nowadays , more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals , since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society . 	1
However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients , ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people ' s eating habits . 	1
In this essay , I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above . 	0
First of all , to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people . 	0
Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences . 	0
To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . 	1
Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . 	0
Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . 	0
I would explore my primary reasons here . 	0
Of course don ' t . 	0
Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . 	0
And also when you see an airport ? 	0
Do you think they have built by chance ? 	0
What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? 	0
What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? 	0
People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . 	0
If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . 	0
What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction . 	1
And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . 	0
The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . 	0
New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government 	0
The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . 	0
Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . 	0
Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . 	0
Moreover , some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world . 	0
" Blood diamond " , an adaptation of a real story in South Africa , focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict . 	0
The movie is humorous and satiric , which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives , and it reminds us how important our families are . 	0
Thus , the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves . 	1
As a result , serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way . 	1
For the above reasons , I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives . 	1
After watching the movie , we may learn a lesson between jewels and death . 	0
Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love ; indeed , the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality . 	0
In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . 	0
Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . 	0
Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	1
In conclusion , teachers are the best for children ' s education . 	1
It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
Creative Artists 	0
One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information . 	1
They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
On the other hand , sometimes I would rather learning on my own . 	1
Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher . 	1
Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time . 	0
A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier . 	0
Different people prefer different styles of learning . 	0
Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own 	0
Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning . 	1
I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful . 	1
And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused . 	1
In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her . 	0
It ' s all the same in every profession . 	0
As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment . 	0
They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily . 	1
First of all , a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career . 	0
From my prospect , I believe that they do deserve this high payment . 	1
They are not paid for no reason . 	0
Therefore , those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways . 	1
Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine . 	0
Should we pay professional athletes ( entertainers ) a high salary ? 	0
This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money ? 	0
Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this . 	0
The first reason is life is simple in the past . 	0
They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses . 	0
Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts . 	1
Nowadays , all humans compete together . 	0
It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students . 	0
Students take a break of year or two , some students travel all around the world during this time , and some choose to take up a job . 	0
Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea 	0
Nowadays , it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies . 	0
Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies . 	0
Since world population getting higher , competition is getting fierce . 	0
Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way . 	1
It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent . 	0
If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away . 	0
That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously . 	1
Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . 	1
In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology 	0
The life today is totally different from half centuries before . 	0
It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . 	0
Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . 	0
I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work . 	0
I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them . 	0
Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems ; however it also deprives of some things that we had . 	0
Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus 	0
While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that . 	1
To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . 	0
If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health . 	0
For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . 	0
Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	1
They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
Instead of this , some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution . 	0
After analyzing both points of view , I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process . 	1
Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study . 	0
This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances . 	0
Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? 	0
However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself . 	0
Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs . 	1
Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying . 	0
College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries . 	0
In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . 	1
While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query . 	0
In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . 	0
Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	0
These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	0
Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . 	1
Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . 	0
For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . 	0
Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . 	0
In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . 	0
Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . 	0
Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . 	0
Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
Studying alone or in a group 	0
For example , I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university . 	0
The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . 	0
Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . 	1
However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them . 	1
Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time . 	0
They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . 	0
In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . 	0
First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . 	1
For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . 	0
However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . 	0
I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields . 	1
Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ? 	0
Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . 	0
Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts . 	0
However , their talents should not be overrated . 	0
Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people . 	0
Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar , hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose . 	1
Like the media , artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely . 	1
However , artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people . 	0
Frank Zappa once said , " Mind is like a parachute , it doesn ' t work if its not open “ . 	0
Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains . 	0
In addition , creativity also gives aesthetic charm . 	0
As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
For instance , Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government , just because she raised a social issue . 	0
This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds . 	0
Commuincation can bring many benefits . 	0
It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication . 	0
Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers . 	0
For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal . 	0
In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits . 	1
We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . 	0
Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages . 	0
Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people . 	0
In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education , at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced . 	1
This is where the computer proves to be incompetent . 	0
To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
Moreover , parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children . 	0
In this way , communication between family members is visibly destroyed . 	1
Last but not least , watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human . 	1
For example , watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing . 	0
What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does ? 	0
is this one of the reason cause division in society ? 	0
In conclusion , though television has some good sides , it has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television . 	0
Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . 	0
Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	0
Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . 	1
Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . 	0
However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress . 	0
In conclusion , I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town . 	1
In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities . 	0
Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language . 	1
Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to . 	1
On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice . 	0
There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language . 	0
When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible . 	1
By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . 	0
Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice . 	1
The professor provides good answers to you . 	0
They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem . 	0
In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important . 	0
During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library . 	0
These activities lead to more interact with their friends . 	0
Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies . 	0
While the online course keeps the children at their home only . 	0
The professor has been assigned to teach only . 	0
Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question . 	0
As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . 	0
Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . 	0
Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . 	0
While when it comes to " happier " , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . 	0
Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . 	0
Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . 	0
To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . 	0
Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . 	1
Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . 	0
They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	0
These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . 	1
Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . 	0
Most of workers have adapted to do same task . 	0
While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job , but from my perspective , I am on the side of my father . 	0
As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . 	0
It allows us to achieve more . 	0
In my family , the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father ' s job . 	0
Different types of tasks endow more colors to our life 	0
Every time I asked him why , he will say , seriously , " I am done , doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different , that is all . " 	0
Five years ago , he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer , and became a landscape painter . 	0
It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . 	0
But , the break should be an optional thing . 	0
Importantly , the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them . 	1
A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	0
Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition . 	0
Thus , a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies . 	1
One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life . 	0
Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does 	0
With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . 	0
They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . 	0
While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us . 	1
About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . 	0
These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . 	0
In conclusion , from my point of view , type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone . 	1
To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory . 	0
However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . 	1
First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . 	0
If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . 	0
Then we will feel less interested in them . 	0
However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper . 	1
First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . 	0
While there are also some people who do not like this . 	0
Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . 	0
Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . 	0
For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . 	0
We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . 	0
Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . 	1
If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	0
Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . 	1
Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . 	0
Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . 	0
Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	0
Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . 	1
Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
Both sides of the arguments have its merits . 	0
Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . 	0
Do modern communication technologies benefit all people 	0
To summarize , higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons . 	1
America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	0
Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . 	0
Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . 	1
However , it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars . 	1
Therefore , I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run . 	0
They argue that people , especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques . 	0
But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years . 	0
In fact , many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture . 	0
On the other hand , some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles . 	1
Additionally , technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing . 	1
For example , China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens . 	0
In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . 	1
Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . 	0
All advantages considered , classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school . 	1
Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension . 	0
Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
I belive this , due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students . 	1
Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right . 	1
I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ’ t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them . 	0
In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively . 	0
Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students . 	1
Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides . 	1
However , standardized tests offer them such chance . 	0
For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . 	0
By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	0
However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	0
Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . 	1
In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . 	1
For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . 	0
Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects . 	1
Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . 	0
In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	0
On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . 	1
First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . 	1
This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . 	0
That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . 	0
The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . 	0
Keeping animals in zoos 	0
Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . 	0
Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . 	0
Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
To sumarize , there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life . 	1
They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention . 	1
First of all , when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes . 	1
For instance , most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems . 	0
Second of all , experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile . 	1
For example , scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final . 	0
The expression " Never , never give up " means keep trying and never stop working 	0
Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education , love and economy . 	0
Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that ; however , I completely disagree with this idea . 	0
I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal . 	1
To sum up , I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure . 	1
In opposite , they have to learn new points from that failure , and they become more experienced . 	1
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	0
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . 	0
On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	0
To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	1
Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . 	1
For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . 	0
Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . 	0
Most libraries are free not for students also for public . 	0
Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . 	0
But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . 	0
Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . 	0
Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
As a result , rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh . 	1
Needless to say , their action will make a beeline for obesity , short-sighted , diabetes and other heart-related problems . 	0
In conclusion , despite the contribution of IT to the society , its effect on the users ' independence and prositution should not be out of concern . 	1
Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
Benefits of students doing extra jobs 	0
In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . 	0
This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . 	0
In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained . 	0
It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . 	0
Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . 	0
In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . 	0
As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . 	0
Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	1
Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . 	1
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
In the conclusion , I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education , the more influence we can get on academic success of students . 	1
Human activities are harming the Earth 	0
Alike , the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically . 	0
Furthermore , almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education . 	0
Last , but not least , financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is . 	1
For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . 	0
Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . 	0
As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . 	0
Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . 	1
As hence it ends up with financially competitive country . 	0
But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware . 	0
As you can imagine , if thousands of families use dish-washing machines , how many water and how much electricity will be wasted ! 	0
In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . 	0
Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . 	1
To start with , because of extensive of using machines , many people loss their job . 	0
Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . 	0
When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . 	0
Apart from this , using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation . 	0
For example , nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing . 	0
Therefore , children may see that this behavior is inexcusable . 	1
On the other hand , too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions . 	1
Question about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities 	0
Today , celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media . 	0
Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip . 	0
Not surprisingly , many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them , especially on their children . 	0
This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants . 	0
Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols . 	0
Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively . 	0
This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace . 	0
This will address students ' interests because it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation . 	0
For example , in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them . 	0
When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react . 	0
In conclusion , using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students ' attention and keep them eager on learning , not only because it reinforces students ' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own . 	1
For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city . 	0
Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . 	0
Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world . 	0
So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not . 	1
Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places . 	0
However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet . 	0
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place . 	1
It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health . 	0
In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all . 	0
Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers . 	1
Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects . 	0
Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . 	0
Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . 	0
I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . 	0
So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . 	0
If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . 	0
Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . 	0
Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own . 	0
Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice . 	0
In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them . 	0
Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students . 	0
For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue . 	0
Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students . 	1
However , I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge . 	1
This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it . 	0
The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams . 	0
Students should be required to take regular standardized tests 	0
This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . 	0
That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . 	0
You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . 	0
Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . 	0
Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . 	0
So , I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at . 	1
If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . 	0
For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . 	0
Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . 	1
In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . 	0
For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . 	0
To sum up , technology has helped us to have more comfortable life . 	1
But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily . 	0
You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth . 	1
They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn . 	0
People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . 	0
The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things . 	1
Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . 	0
If you did , it was probably at a zoo . 	0
Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey ? 	0
Zoos have no useful purpose ? 	0
In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . 	0
When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . 	0
I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction , education , and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding . 	1
A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose . 	0
This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group . 	0
The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	1
Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . 	0
All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	0
International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . 	1
My view is that international aid should be prioritised . 	1
They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . 	0
Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . 	0
The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . 	0
International aid 	0
However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . 	0
Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . 	0
It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	0
What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . 	0
However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . 	0
In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . 	0
To sum up , students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say . 	1
It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives . 	0
By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man , we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language . 	1
These are important foundation of modern civilization . 	0
Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems . 	0
Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally-friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change . 	0
Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values . 	0
Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle . 	0
Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance . 	0
As far as I am concerned , the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to . 	1
Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit . 	1
Do you agree that the traditional skills will die out ? 	0
With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology . 	0
This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study . 	1
Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year . 	1
As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves , heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule . 	0
For example , suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family . 	0
To quote an instance , in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams . 	0
It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation . 	1
Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . 	0
Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course . 	0
Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers . 	1
If you would like to attend a business school , you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university . 	0
I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game . 	0
During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes . 	0
Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue . 	0
He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community ' s university . 	0
It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school . 	1
Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly . 	0
Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed . 	0
There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals . 	0
In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff . 	1
When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society , animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned . 	0
I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education . 	1
Zoos should be banned 	0
Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen . 	0
Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	0
In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . 	0
Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant . 	1
Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . 	1
With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	0
Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals . 	1
In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area . 	0
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions . 	1
This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	0
For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . 	0
This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . 	0
Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . 	0
In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . 	1
As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	0
As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . 	0
Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . 	1
Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . 	1
In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	0
Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies , I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day . 	1
Physical exercise should be required part of every school day 	0
In addition , including exercise in children ' s daily routine , it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age . 	1
Exercise is good not only for having a good health body , but also for the mind . 	1
When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . 	0
It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . 	0
Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	1
After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . 	0
We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . 	0
Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . 	1
As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . 	0
By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . 	0
During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . 	0
Why are groups or organizations important to people ? 	0
My reasons include the following : In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . 	0
In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals . 	1
More wastes have to be managed . 	0
Maybe crime rate will also increase . 	0
International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions 	0
Traffic may worsen . 	0
However , building the university may lead to some social problems . 	1
For example in FIFA World Cup 2010 , the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking . 	0
An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world . 	0
This can also help stimulate the local economy . 	1
Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success 	0
Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . 	0
The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action . 	0
However , due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success . 	1
First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . 	0
These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community . 	0
In sum , I myself agree with the plan to build the university . 	1
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
As a result , if we don ' t have a good stress management skill , it may lead to some critical problems . 	1
When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising . 	0
Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
Instead , the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price . 	0
This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
Therefore , the measure cannot be adopted , otherwise those companies will go into liquidation . 	1
In short , this is not a long-term solution . 	0
Moreover , these products prove to ensure human health completely . 	0
Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs , they would make no profit , even running up debt because of production expenditure . 	0
Additionally , charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free . 	0
In conclusion , I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines , which may exacerbate their qualities . 	1
Fortunately , there are other measures to improve the situation . 	1
It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes . 	0
Most of the time , it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product . 	1
Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one . 	1
Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . 	0
Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society . 	1
I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs . 	0
Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence 	0
The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . 	0
Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . 	0
First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . 	0
As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . 	0
By which I mean , huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product . 	0
Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . 	0
Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room . 	0
As a consequence , children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents . 	1
Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . 	1
However , have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family ? 	0
I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us . 	1
Television versus Friends and family 	0
We all know that television provides us many benefits ; it helps people relax , helps keep up with news , helps broad our mind . 	0
Gradually , their friends leave them behind either activities or studying . 	0
Secondly , with the rapid change of the standard of life , each family has three or four TV in each room is more common . 	0
First of all , since people watch television too much , they can be isolated from others . 	1
Children , for example , pay more attention on movies , music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others . 	0
First , children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents . 	1
Are parents best teachers ? 	0
Consequently , parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind . 	0
Second , parents train their child how to become a good person . 	1
As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents . 	0
Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that . 	0
They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way . 	0
On the one hand , it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person . 	0
For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	0
Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . 	0
First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
Gun control and increasing violence 	0
Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
For example in relationships . 	0
Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . 	0
From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . 	0
It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . 	0
As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . 	0
Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . 	0
That is problem in quality of education . 	0
Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . 	0
Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . 	0
To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
The co-workers should be cooperative with one another . 	0
If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes . 	0
Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious . 	0
They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not . 	0
Some important characteristics of a co-worker 	0
At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment . 	0
However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . 	0
Therefore in my view , a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship . 	1
In conclusion , fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships . 	1
Therefore , I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity . 	0
Should the cost of medicines be reduced ? 	0
At present , a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases . 	0
It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths . 	0
Admittedly , more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines . 	0
The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs . 	0
With advanced technology , the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines , which can cure a variety of serious illnesses . 	0
If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs , their health situations may be better . 	0
The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity . 	1
However , in my view , reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons . 	1
Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . 	1
Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	1
On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . 	1
It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	1
In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . 	0
In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . 	0
In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	0
They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . 	0
The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . 	1
Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages . 	1
Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . 	0
Improved medical care 	0
Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
Secondly , reading a novel is more convenient . 	1
Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
Admittedly , technology may have negative effects on children . 	1
Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . 	0
In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . 	0
Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	0
As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . 	0
Financial aid to develop countries 	0
However , it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries . 	1
It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . 	0
From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . 	1
Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	0
Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . 	0
First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . 	1
In my opinion , I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is . 	1
These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . 	0
Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . 	0
In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . 	0
University students should attend classes or not ? 	0
Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . 	0
Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . 	0
Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
In my opinion , though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level , but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run ; while on the contrary , co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team . 	1
I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch . 	0
Secondly , children need human interactions . 	1
However , I do not agree that this explosion in technology will ' innovate ' the education system , by replacing teachers with computers . 	1
There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . 	0
There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms 	0
In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process . 	0
For example , lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector . 	0
However , scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching . 	0
Firstly , computers need to be operated by people . 	1
No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today . 	0
In my view , both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace . 	0
In conclusion , while there some people live in a pretty good condition , it is only a minority . 	1
Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ; however , it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life . 	0
If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation . 	0
Thus , the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today . 	1
The third reason is that the pace of life . 	1
Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space . 	0
What ' s worse , it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases . 	0
Second , the environment today is serious damaged . 	0
Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings . 	0
This situation becomes lifestyle habits , and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use . 	0
Every day , people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it . 	1
In conclusion , in era technology like this age , computer becomes important thing in human life . 	1
This is due to using computer more efficient and , many workers cannot do more in work without computer . 	0
Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country . 	0
Businessmen , for example , use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues . 	0
Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . 	0
The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system 	0
Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . 	1
However , I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential . 	1
With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	0
It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . 	0
Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . 	0
Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . 	1
Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . 	1
In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . 	0
Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art . 	0
In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages . 	0
With the development of globalization , English became the dominated language in national trade , conference and many important events . 	0
Advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English 	0
Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people . 	1
This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public . 	0
In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas . 	0
First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly . 	0
If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well . 	0
Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers . 	0
In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . 	0
As one Chinese idiom goes : " The good medicine tastes bitter “ . 	0
However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . 	0
Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . 	0
Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . 	1
Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . 	0
It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . 	0
Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . 	0
Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . 	0
However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? 	0
Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . 	1
Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . 	0
I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . 	0
Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . 	1
People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . 	0
For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . 	0
After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . 	0
Nobody has a life with a lot of fun ; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone , but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual ' s live . 	1
Besides , dancing could show how civilization of that culture is . 	0
Moreover , people use dancing to entertain themselves . 	0
So dancing is important in every culture . 	1
This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media , but from the basis of their own interests . 	0
In conclusion , parents should be more worried about their children ' s attitudes to the ' cult of celebrity ' . 	1
As recent surveys showed , inspired by the fame and wealth , children now prefer more to become an actor / actress or a sports star than it was in the past . 	0
Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable . 	0
They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life . 	0
Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience . 	0
However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . 	0
Thus , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
The reason is that , as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge . 	0
Therefore , i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems . 	0
To sum up , although mobile phones make our communication faster , it also gives rise to many social problems such as children ' s social skills and their mental health . 	1
Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . 	1
On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . 	1
For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . 	0
If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	0
In conclusion , the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment . 	1
Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily . 	1
Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . 	0
But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not . 	0
Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . 	0
Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . 	0
Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . 	0
Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . 	0
Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone 	0
First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . 	1
There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows . 	0
However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . 	0
Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . 	0
In conclusion , although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working , problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well . 	1
Children engagement in paid work 	0
Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	1
Especially in large population countries , high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability . 	0
First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . 	0
From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . 	0
Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . 	1
Higher education should be available only to good students or not 	0
No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone . 	0
College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal . 	0
There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university . 	0
This issue will be discussed . 	0
First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . 	1
The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . 	0
College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . 	0
They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . 	0
Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . 	0
On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . 	1
Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . 	0
Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children , otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time . 	0
In my point of view , both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children . 	1
Children should studying hard or playing sport ? 	0
Both can improve their future 	0
For instance , there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases . 	0
Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . 	0
In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . 	0
As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . 	0
Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	0
I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons . 	0
Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . 	1
Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self-study , depends on our teachers a lot . 	0
There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers . 	1
Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life 	0
Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . 	0
Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition . 	1
It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . 	0
When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . 	0
If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . 	0
As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	1
Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . 	1
Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . 	0
People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time 	0
Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life , for several reasons . 	1
Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . 	0
In summary , doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better . 	1
Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	1
Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . 	0
I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . 	0
Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love . 	1
Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . 	0
As a result , I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal . 	1
Beside , I could express my personal thought through telephones and email . 	0
Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . 	1
Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . 	0
So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . 	0
For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . 	0
Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching , while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing . 	0
In my opinion , I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school . 	1
How teachers can make the subject interesting to students ! 	0
Some people would rather watch TV . 	0
Reading fictions is more pleasant 	0
There are many different opinions regarding hobbies . 	0
Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels , where each scene is happening . 	0
For example , after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution , I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people . 	0
Firstly , fiction books pay more attention to details . 	1
In fact , we can know characters , places , and times of a novel very well during reading it . 	0
First of all , by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject . 	1
Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class . 	0
Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . 	0
Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	1
Living in smal towns 	0
Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . 	0
Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . 	0
I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities . 	1
Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . 	0
One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . 	0
Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . 	0
Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . 	0
Hence , this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature . 	0
To sum up , art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere , so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work . 	1
Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted . 	1
Indeed , not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts . 	0
Consequently , frequent conflicts may occur during communication . 	0
In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors . 	0
Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy , focus on work . 	0
In conclusion , providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages . 	1
Of course , excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss . 	0
Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business , so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result . 	0
Thirdly , providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge . 	1
They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice . 	0
I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees . 	1
I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project . 	0
They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . 	0
The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . 	0
Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	0
Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . 	0
In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . 	0
Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . 	1
Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	0
They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . 	0
And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail . 	1
When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail . 	0
For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite . 	0
Thirdly , when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself . 	1
To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail . 	1
You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business . 	0
I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
Furthermore , they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other . 	0
Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure . 	0
Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective . 	0
Taking all into account , I think that living in the city is much better nowadays , because of the opportunities it gives . 	1
Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness . 	0
However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location . 	1
The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication . 	1
This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . 	0
If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	0
Also , they do not have to educate and they do not have to work , so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life . 	1
In addition , in this age they are not expected to be responsible . 	1
As much as their events might were bitter , in their adulthood they are sweet . 	0
When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events . 	0
You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood . 	0
Children are free 	0
Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them . 	1
Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs . 	0
In the first place , children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare . 	0
In my opinion , childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas . 	1
Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career 	0
When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . 	0
So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
Use of CCTV cameras 	0
It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . 	0
Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . 	0
Firstly , international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country ’ s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists . 	0
While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries , I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights , ancient heritages and different cultures around the world . 	0
International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
Secondly , through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected . 	0
Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country . 	1
These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard . 	0
Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores . 	0
Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works . 	0
For instance , in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‘ Trong Dong ’ drum performance and ‘ Ha Long ’ bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry . 	0
Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . 	0
Tax revenue is collected from those who works . 	0
Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	0
Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . 	0
Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless 	0
Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . 	1
However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out . 	1
Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . 	1
If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	0
Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . 	1
To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . 	0
Although higher education does not guarantee young students ' success , the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges . 	1
More importantly , many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society . 	0
Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships . 	0
It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future . 	0
Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . 	1
Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . 	0
By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . 	0
Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	0
In conclusion , I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . 	1
By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation . 	1
With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . 	0
Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	1
In my opinion , by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution . 	1
On the other hand , I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies . 	1
Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals . 	1
In conclusion , due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution , both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution . 	1
On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . 	0
Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . 	0
I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . 	0
Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . 	0
After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	0
Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . 	1
When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . 	0
My mother took me to The National Camp . 	0
At first , I just ate and played alone . 	0
But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . 	0
Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment . 	0
What is more , the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict , therefore , staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative . 	0
With the rapid developing pace , IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves . 	1
In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going . 	0
However , it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental . 	0
In my opinion , there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense . 	1
Future information technology : positive or negative ? 	0
The appearance of information technology ( IT ) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency . 	0
So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . 	0
On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work . 	0
Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens . 	0
The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes . 	0
Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome . 	1
After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth . 	1
The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy . 	1
Therefore , it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free . 	0
The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	0
Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . 	0
Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying . 	0
In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . 	1
People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose . 	0
This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive . 	0
For example , in earlier times , people didn ' t leave for faraway places , because they could easily get lost . 	0
Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example . 	0
To begin with , learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt . 	1
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Consequently , I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course . 	1
Besides , learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills , and learning how to solve problem in real situation . 	0
Learning in classroom could provide more information to study . 	0
But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative . 	0
Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes ? 	0
In conclusion , the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone ' s career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender . 	1
Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions . 	0
To sum thing up , I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school , but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students . 	1
Ultimately , this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society . 	0
Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . 	0
These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities . 	0
So , learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college . 	0
According to this opinion , giving equal education for both men and women is a must . 	1
I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives . 	1
However , it is had some demerits on their social lives . 	1
Modern forms of communication ; ' electronic letter ' 	0
Undoubtedly , the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better , which help people to interact to others , such as email and messaging without limitation time . 	0
Another perspective , using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable . 	0
It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere , so they do not do much social live interactions with others . 	0
Mentioned to societies life style , they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had . 	0
Obviousness , there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time . 	1
The consequence of this case made some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts . 	1
However , people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly . 	0
This is because they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths . 	0
It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably . 	0
More specifically , people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication . 	1
On one hand , i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs . 	0
In the following paragraphs , some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively . 	0
I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job . 	1
Along with the increasing physical demands of human life , salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone . 	0
Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job 	0
There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters . 	0
On the other hand , i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field . 	1
Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . 	0
As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	0
In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . 	0
They will argue , it can destruct students from their study . 	1
However , as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result ; therefore , i believe part time job will be good for students . 	1
Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future . 	0
Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively 	0
There is no doubt that television or movies influence people ’ s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways . 	0
But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways . 	1
They make people to eat more rubbish food , spend less time with their friends and family , and be someone that are not themselves . 	1
There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television . 	1
Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas . 	0
It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people ’ s health . 	0
Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods . 	0
In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases . 	0
Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children . 	1
Consequently , dancing are the part of people belief . 	1
Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come . 	0
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture . 	0
Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe . 	0
In any case , a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . 	0
Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . 	0
He granted huge sums for such idea . 	0
Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . 	0
I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste . 	1
Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job . 	1
Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . 	1
To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
To give a brief conclusion , Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways . 	1
Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	0
With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . 	0
Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . 	0
Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes . 	1
Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	1
On the other hand , creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like . 	1
Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons . 	0
Protect animals or not ? 	0
In my opinion , we should give priority to our own issues . 	1
While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention . 	0
If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat . 	0
Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem . 	0
However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution . 	1
Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible . 	1
A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment . 	0
The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being . 	0
In conclusion , I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people ' s interaction , because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships . 	1
In this way , technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships . 	1
Also , they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet . 	0
In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests . 	0
Therefore , the progress of news media is an advantageous development . 	1
Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . 	0
In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . 	0
The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . 	0
High sum of money of modern artist 	0
Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . 	0
It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . 	0
Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . 	1
I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in . 	1
On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . 	0
For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . 	0
Some people regard stress as a power , which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best ; other people cannot charge of their thoughts , emotions , and the way they deal with problems . 	0
In the frenetic , fast-paced world , it is a very common predicament that all of us , from the young to the senior , feel depressed caused by stress , such as financial problems , exam stress , relationship difficulties and work overload . 	0
But , we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity . 	1
Personally , English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications . 	1
Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system . 	0
However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct . 	1
Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity . 	0
It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious . 	0
Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks . 	1
Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens . 	0
This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings . 	0
When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine . 	0
Nevertheless , I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises , which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally . 	1
In a nutshell , many activities can let humans relax . 	1
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	1
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	1
Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . 	0
To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge . 	0
The professors ’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses . 	0
Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ? 	0
In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . 	0
To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	0
Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . 	0
Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . 	1
Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . 	0
Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . 	0
In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . 	0
By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . 	0
All in all , I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way . 	1
Of course , effective cooperation can make things easier and faster , but in many important cases when team-working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help . 	0
However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . 	0
Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	0
Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	1
Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development . 	1
Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects . 	1
What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . 	0
There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . 	0
First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . 	0
The reasons are based on the following aspects . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . 	0
Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	0
Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? 	0
Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . 	0
Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . 	0
Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . 	0
This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . 	0
In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . 	0
Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program . 	1
Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . 	1
Schools should only teach children the academic subject 	0
People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . 	0
This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . 	0
Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . 	0
As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong . 	0
However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children ’ s television programs . 	0
Admittedly , reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate . 	0
Personally , I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids , while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable . 	1
Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today . 	0
Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society . 	0
Large amount of violence in television programs 	0
Nevertheless , it would certainly be a violation of adults ’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences . 	1
Therefore , it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies . 	1
Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
In conclusion , working with a group a people and working individually are all important . 	0
Both skills are necessary for a successful life . 	0
Nevertheless , the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations . 	1
Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas . 	0
Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members . 	0
When we work in team , we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate . 	0
When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective . 	0
Consequently , conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent . 	0
In other word , professor should concern about preparing class . 	1
Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field . 	1
However , the precondition of doing research is growing students ’ solid theory fundamental . 	0
And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions . 	0
They can manage the electric theory in practical skills . 	0
This is requires professors provide high quality courses . 	0
However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research . 	0
Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way . 	1
In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . 	0
Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . 	0
Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	1
In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . 	0
In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . 	0
Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . 	0
In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future . 	1
The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . 	0
Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . 	0
Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable 	0
In the following paragraphs , both sides of the above matter as well as my own view ' s explanations would be analyzed and given , respectively . 	0
Firstly , it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically . 	1
Air-conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities . 	0
Moreover , applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives . 	0
Negative effects of technological process 	0
It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy . 	0
Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives . 	0
I personally disagree with this view . 	0
As far as I am concerned , both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . 	0
Dormitory or apartment ? 	0
When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . 	0
However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . 	0
In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process . 	1
For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . 	0
Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . 	0
The research projects like windows opened to the wider world . 	1
Although my university is not in the high-ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects . 	0
It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus . 	0
Secondly , professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities . 	1
Consequently , there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages . 	0
Also , you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together . 	0
Universities positively contribute the professors ' success . 	0
We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin . 	0
With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom . 	0
Last but not least , doing research could also improve the teaching quality . 	1
Because children are poor at time management , and are less mature to make a good judgment , they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies . 	1
However , it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching . 	0
In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained , I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue . 	1
A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . 	0
Popular events are essential 	0
Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . 	0
These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . 	0
The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . 	0
As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . 	1
One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . 	1
They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . 	0
For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . 	0
Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . 	1
Amount of control on media information 	0
Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . 	0
It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . 	0
However , I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures . 	1
A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . 	0
This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	0
First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
University education is needed for success 	0
I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
Computers have made humans over-dependent . 	1
However , everything has pros and cons . 	0
There is no end to the evolution of computers . 	0
Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on . 	0
Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright . 	1
Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it . 	1
Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . 	1
That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	1
This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers . 	1
The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . 	0
Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . 	0
It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis . 	1
Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects 	0
In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . 	0
For example , now there are more chances to do business with people around the world , so besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well . 	0
For another example , financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century , thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management . 	0
I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution . 	1
First , in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions . 	0
Air pollution 	0
Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way . 	0
If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause . 	1
Second , private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating . 	0
The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution . 	0
While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution . 	0
The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not . 	0
Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . 	0
While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . 	0
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future . 	1
The following reasons will present my points . 	0
First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus . 	1
However , as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges . 	0
Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . 	0
What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . 	0
For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . 	0
Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . 	1
In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects . 	1
These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	0
For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . 	0
They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . 	0
A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . 	0
By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . 	1
When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . 	0
For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . 	0
Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . 	1
Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	0
Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . 	0
Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . 	0
Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	0
Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . 	0
A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . 	0
Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . 	1
In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . 	0
A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . 	0
Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . 	0
However , a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school . 	1
Is a break good or bad after high school for students 	0
Studies are an essential part of life . 	0
Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable 	0
This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable , even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind . 	0
Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today ' s world in fast pace . 	0
I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today ' s world . 	1
However , it might not be the most beneficial move to our society . 	1
Primarily , even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy . 	1
Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy . 	0
If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline . 	0
In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . 	0
It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it . 	0
This will improve the quality of both universities and students , thus placing people in positions which suit them most . 	1
It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . 	0
This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	1
There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . 	0
Personally , I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment , but we need to analyze some specific situations . 	1
The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great 	0
Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . 	0
However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	0
Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . 	0
On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . 	1
For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . 	0
In conclusion , I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children . 	1
Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . 	0
Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	0
This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life . 	0
Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	0
Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . 	0
I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten . 	1
This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . 	0
Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . 	0
To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . 	1
Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . 	0
Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten 	0
However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . 	0
Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school . 	0
In conclusion , people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation . 	1
Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face . 	0
As a result , communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more . 	0
Furthermore , it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today . 	1
In fact , these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices . 	0
By contrast , modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits . 	0
Therefore , there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival . 	0
Thus , I would conclude that traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games . 	1
Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process . 	1
Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . 	0
In addition , Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World . 	0
They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes . 	0
Moreover , It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World . 	0
Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child ' s vision . 	0
Therefore , they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance . 	1
Overall , it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate , understanding other studies , etc , to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education . 	1
In conclusion , advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter . 	1
Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines . 	0
As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations . 	0
It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors . 	0
Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods . 	0
In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people . 	1
Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added . 	0
These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good . 	0
In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle . 	0
However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . 	0
Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . 	1
In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	0
The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . 	0
For the reasons mentioned above , it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently , it should be made illegal . 	1
To sum up , in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves , I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas . 	1
Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . 	0
Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . 	0
Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . 	1
In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . 	0
In conclusion , being different and unique is the better way to achieve success . 	1
It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success . 	1
It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . 	0
So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . 	0
In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	1
Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both . 	0
Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run . 	1
For example , students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them . 	0
On the other hand , females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys . 	0
Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills . 	0
It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . 	0
Unfortunately , some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc . This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society . 	1
Time and again , women have proved their mettle in every field . 	0
Equality in education will help in development of the society . 	1
It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them . 	0
They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences . 	0
In conclusion , challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation , whether in career or in self-identification . 	1
It is hard to judge which generation ' s problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation , there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters . 	1
Second , this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation . 	1
The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them . 	0
In conclusion , there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important . 	0
Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others . 	0
However , people might not get what they want all the time . 	0
Consideration and communication , in my personal opinion , are the most important quality . 	1
The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect 	0
Secondly , the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection . 	1
Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos . 	0
For the above reasons , if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world , we must stop by these museums . 	1
During our trip , it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place . 	1
Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . 	1
Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . 	0
As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . 	0
Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	0
Universities are relatively fenced environment . 	0
First of all , doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors . 	0
In addition , by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies . 	0
The research projects provide communication with the outside . 	0
These days , more and more university professors are involved in scientific research . 	0
Professors should do more research or teach students ? 	0
However , according to my experiences , professors should be encouraged to mainly do research . 	1
Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching . 	0
He was often invited to do speech in other universities . 	0
I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college . 	0
By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
Having job would affect their health , divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life . 	1
Thus , for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies . 	1
Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	1
This means , there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants . 	0
Secondly , restaurants are places that people usually come with their families . 	0
They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them . 	0
Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals . 	1
First of all , restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals . 	0
In my opinion , smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably . 	1
Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively , those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human ' s body . 	0
There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human ' s body . 	0
Generally speaking , smoking is never been good for human ' s body . 	0
Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants 	0
Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . 	1
In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . 	0
First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . 	0
All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . 	1
Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . 	0
In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else . 	1
Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries 	0
Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . 	0
For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	0
Second , usually libraries do not have income . 	0
Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . 	0
In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . 	0
For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . 	0
Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . 	1
We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance . 	1
From my point of view although appearance is important , personality is the most important . 	1
Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . 	0
Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look 	0
For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . 	0
First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . 	1
I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes . 	0
Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . 	0
Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . 	1
Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . 	0
Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . 	0
When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . 	0
However , strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society . 	1
Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases . 	0
Retribution is the method for countering criminals . 	0
Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . 	0
Capital punishment - necessary or not 	0
Crime is always punishable . 	0
I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . 	0
Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents . 	1
First of all , children generally have weak self-control , and thus they lose their time easily . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively . 	1
Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . 	0
For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . 	0
In 19th century , television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house . 	0
Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school ? 	0
Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . 	0
If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . 	0
Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . 	1
In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . 	0
Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . 	1
Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . 	1
I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes . 	0
Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours . 	0
By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly since youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities . 	0
High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need 	0
Nowadays , we can see advertisements everywhere , from television set to posters on the streets . 	0
The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose . 	1
Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . 	0
At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes . 	0
I tend to agree with this view . 	0
Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up . 	0
However , a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended . 	0
To sum up , it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals . 	1
However , I am convinced that it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind . 	1
It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . 	0
Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life , so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings . 	0
Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . 	0
Cooking is not a waste of time , contrarily , it is crucial for our health and culture . 	0
But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking . 	0
In conclusion , although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work , it is not a good thing . 	1
But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home . 	1
They will have to pay a lot of bills , because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant , who they may not like . 	0
Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly 	0
Many young adults want to get away from their parent ' s houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits , to be independent . 	0
If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working , because they will not have money to pay for everything . 	0
There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home , because parents will take care for them . 	0
Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money . 	1
If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal . 	0
Moreover , parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying . 	0
Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant , who they do not like . 	1
After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life . 	0
From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government . 	0
It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity . 	0
In conclusion , even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits , it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly . 	1
For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
I firmly believe that psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment . 	1
Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society . 	1
However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict . 	0
Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner . 	1
They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
However , still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum , instead , they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done . 	0
Besides , most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs . 	0
Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness . 	1
This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects . 	0
However , the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected . 	0
Most importantly , under such target-oriented education environment , teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study . 	0
Moreover , the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study . 	0
It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students ' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents , while its shortfalls are so vital to students ' future . 	1
Therefore , I do support the view of learning all school subjects . 	1
In conclusion , even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends , I think they are wrong , since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice . 	1
In light of the above-mentioned facts , one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically . 	1
To be specific , scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough . 	0
In general , the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine . 	1
Today , even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists . 	0
The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives . 	0
Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour . 	0
Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains . 	0
For example , I have started to read a novel since last week . 	0
I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day , so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class . 	0
In contrast , I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that , I have to study . 	0
Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies . 	1
This point has some merits on the surface ; however , movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners . 	0
For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable . 	0
To sum up , reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth , are much easier to use , and more useful for language learners . 	1
Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . 	0
However , from my point of view , television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other . 	1
Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends 	0
There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . 	0
Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . 	0
One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " . 	0
To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . 	1
One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . 	0
This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . 	0
That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . 	0
Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . 	0
Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . 	0
For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . 	0
To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . 	0
Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	1
Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . 	0
Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog . 	0
For example , in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits . 	0
To begin with , nowadays , to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever . 	0
From my point of view , this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks . 	1
By means of some software such as Skype , MSN , Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want . 	0
Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does . 	1
In conclusion , I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors . 	1
Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present , it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete . 	1
He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . 	0
Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . 	0
At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	0
Although it is good to be lucky , depending on luck for everything is not good . 	1
Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	1
Nowadays , the Earth has become like a small village . 	0
For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . 	0
Furthermore , killing is worse . 	0
In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ’ t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . 	0
Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	1
For example , a child watches a frightening movie . 	0
Technology impact on people 	0
There are many advantages of distance learning , but it should not replace classroom learning . 	1
In the course of the last hundred years , the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology . 	0
I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves . 	0
As the world ' s situation is always changing , act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges . 	1
No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils . 	0
As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education . 	0
Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' . 	0
I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model . 	0
In conclusion , there can be no school without a teacher . 	1
I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process , but they will never take their place . 	1
Teachers are not just teachers , they are also friends and conseilieurs . 	1
These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . 	0
Young people move to cities 	0
To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . 	0
Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this . 	0
However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . 	0
For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	0
As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . 	1
There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned . 	1
To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . 	0
Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing , including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health , I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings . 	1
Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions 	0
Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . 	0
This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	1
The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . 	0
In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . 	0
But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . 	0
This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	0
People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . 	1
It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . 	0
To conclude , the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons . 	1
Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years . 	1
Wherever possible , exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment . 	0
Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills . 	0
In this case , teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all . 	0
A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns . 	1
However , exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system . 	1
Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability . 	0
In conclusion , it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement . 	1
However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention . 	0
Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	0
In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . 	1
Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . 	0
This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . 	0
Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . 	0
Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . 	0
Furthermore , stress takes a toll on our health . 	0
Therefore , stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization . 	1
This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress . 	0
It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles , frustrations , and demands . 	0
Melancholia , the most fatal problem , even leads some people to commit suicide . 	0
Thus , some people have physical problems , such as insomnia and headaches . 	0
From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	1
Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children . 	1
For the above reasons , I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress . 	1
Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people . 	1
Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results . 	0
Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses . 	1
In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad . 	1
Thus , the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported . 	1
In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage . 	0
In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . 	0
So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	0
But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . 	0
Some people may be encouraged to do good things . 	0
She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast . 	0
Thus , she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic . 	0
Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand . 	0
And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	0
I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons . 	1
Firstly , the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room . 	1
However , class is not the only source of knowledge . 	0
Students also learn from other sources such as experience , libraries and other people . 	0
Attending university classes should be required or optional 	0
So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . 	1
Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing . 	1
Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . 	0
For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	0
In my opinion , I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world . 	1
First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . 	1
Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . 	0
However , some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information . 	1
The internet provides a lot of valuable information 	0
In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . 	0
Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . 	0
In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . 	1
Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . 	0
Old and young workers 	0
There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . 	0
To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems . 	1
Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . 	0
There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . 	1
Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . 	0
Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . 	0
By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . 	0
It would mean another industrial revolution . 	0
It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . 	0
As the Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ’ s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions . 	0
For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species . 	0
International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide . 	0
While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries , I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations . 	0
Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits . 	0
This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism . 	0
Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries . 	1
Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals . 	0
For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . 	0
In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . 	0
Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . 	0
They are being rude towards others . 	0
A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues 	0
Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . 	0
First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . 	1
Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . 	0
Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . 	0
Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following . 	0
In conclusion , it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency ; however , the adults should not be the victim of this policy . 	1
Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them . 	0
For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment . 	0
Frequently , adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day . 	0
Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
True function of a university 	0
Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake , it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources . 	0
This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health . 	0
Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer . 	0
Firstly , health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular . 	1
It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect . 	1
Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue , others think it is much beyond that . 	0
Recent years , however , has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians . 	0
Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family ' s meals all around the world . 	0
Since the dawn of time , human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources . 	0
Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian ? 	0
For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . 	0
I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . 	0
This is basic part of the lives . 	0
There may be small or big things , but at last people should accept them , because most of them is about responsibilities . 	0
In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards other people 	0
People should sometimes do things , even though they don ' t enjoy it . 	0
Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . 	0
In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . 	1
Moreover , sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live . 	0
In this essay , the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored . 	1
Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
I wish one day this problem would be changed . 	0
To sum up , the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people ’ s living . 	1
And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community . 	0
Also , it provides many advantages . 	0
Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . 	0
The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars . 	1
For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
Both these factors have their own values , and have been discussed in detail below : Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently . 	1
Some people think that it is better to make them competitive , while other believes to make them co-operative . 	0
It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind , and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life . 	0
People should create a sense of co-operation in their children 	0
However , those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead . 	0
For example , MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team . 	0
This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead , but will also restrict them in many ways . 	0
This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . 	0
I feel that after working out , I am easily to fall asleep . 	0
Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health . 	0
These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . 	0
Thus , after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport . 	0
Second , another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise . 	1
For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . 	0
I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me . 	0
Consequently , I feel happy when I listen music . 	0
These make me stress . 	0
So that I always listen music from my mp3 player . 	0
Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study . 	0
For instance , university students who study business are also know history of the world . 	0
Furthermore , students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers . 	0
Hence , they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another . 	0
Finally , students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career . 	1
This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer . 	0
For example , students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include . 	0
Moreover , bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge . 	0
In concluding , learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future . 	1
Unfortunately , many governments restrict the artists . 	0
I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me . 	0
To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him . 	0
They should not act on suspicion . 	0
This is a very important aspect in the work environment . 	0
Therefore , I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment . 	1
The co-workers need to trust each other . 	1
When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse . 	0
From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility . 	0
However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me . 	0
But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department . 	0
Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . 	0
Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence . 	1
In conclusion , from the above views , although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary , it will bring the higher level of violence . 	1
Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives . 	0
The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities . 	1
This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos . 	0
In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . 	0
Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	0
It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions , but regardless of the condition , zoos are very useful . 	1
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers . 	0
As a result , people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition . 	1
A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family . 	0
But with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall . 	0
People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living . 	0
However , a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security . 	0
People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification 	0
The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century . 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
Moreover , the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment . 	0
The official term of it is named " Technological Unemployment " . 	0
In today ' s world , having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families , the smallest component of the society . 	0
Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . 	0
But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . 	0
And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . 	0
So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . 	1
They will be misleading by those movies . 	0
And they may act like good people in order to get reward . 	0
But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . 	0
I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . 	0
So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	1
Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . 	0
Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . 	0
Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . 	0
If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	0
In conclusion , we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity . 	1
They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	0
The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . 	1
People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . 	0
The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . 	0
Nevertheless , educators and individuals themselves , especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one . 	0
Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also . 	1
In conclusion , I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people ' s health . 	1
Furthermore , living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas . 	1
Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder . 	0
Thus , both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved . 	0
As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? 	0
The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage . 	1
While mother ' s role is essential in a child ' s life , I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood . 	1
For example , in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child . 	0
One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation . 	0
As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job . 	1
In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them . 	0
This can be done in school . 	0
For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job . 	0
If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future . 	0
I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations . 	0
The ability to relate well to people is more important 	0
I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons : We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job . 	1
We should consider many factors and choose the best of them . 	0
In my view , the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics . 	0
Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
In my opinion , we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships . 	0
On the other hand , children are shown how to behave well with others . 	0
The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today . 	1
This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Instead , all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals . 	0
And also dancing to entertain people . 	0
For example , some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life . 	0
First , dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe . 	0
In every country , people do dance for fun , for entertrain , and for decrease a stress . 	0
Dancing plays an important role in a culture . 	0
For instance , a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society . 	0
Thus , they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children . 	0
Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life . 	0
On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process . 	1
Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	0
It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future . 	0
I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual . 	1
Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading , since animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different . 	0
There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . 	0
Consequently , I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity . 	1
In fact , parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life . 	1
Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast . 	0
They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on . 	0
Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed . 	0
I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons . 	1
The whole world is dependent on computers , without which , the world will go back hundreds of years . 	1
The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas . 	0
What ' s more , the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge . 	0
Computers - use , future prospects and over-dependence 	0
It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body . 	0
However , advertising is not the only information source for people . 	0
Since having these products shows their status , the quality obviously is not relatively important . 	0
However , despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated , it is also true that it plays and important role economically . 	1
They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things . 	0
Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life . 	0
The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits 	0
Advertising is becoming part of our modern society . 	0
First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit . 	1
The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self-control . 	0
Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television . 	1
In my opinion , the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute . 	0
At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary . 	0
Keep trying and never stop working for your goals 	0
" Keep running ! , " shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move . 	0
Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth . 	1
For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard . 	0
I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty . 	0
From this experience , I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals . 	1
Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running . 	0
Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger . 	1
Attending university ' s classes is one of activities that students have to do . 	0
All in all , I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be . 	1
So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	0
As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society . 	0
Recently , some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities . 	1
How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public . 	0
Government shouldn ' t put money on building theaters or sports stadiums 	0
Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented . 	1
Therefore , providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government . 	1
As a matter of fact , an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games . 	0
Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums . 	0
The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government . 	0
Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience . 	0
It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment , giving us awesome performances to enjoy . 	1
In conclusion , high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances . 	1
Second , such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances . 	1
That ' s why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods . 	0
They shall reap within their high salaries . 	0
Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves . 	0
Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair . 	1
In other words , if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed . 	0
Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment . 	0
However , in my opinion , as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair . 	0
These factors affect people who work or study from home . 	1
Following both the point of views , the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
Thus , the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home , are obvious . 	1
On the other hand , one part of the society , has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home . 	0
They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies . 	0
In a busy city like Tokyo , students waste a lot of time in travelling . 	0
Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly . 	0
Due to this they lag in their studies . 	0
Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation , he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues . 	0
This harms an employee ' s deliverable . 	0
I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering . 	1
In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people . 	1
First , it ' s true watching TV take a lot of your day , nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs . 	1
Second , people like having meals while they are watching TV . 	1
Television destroys communication among friends and family 	0
Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day . 	0
Besides , watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros . 	0
However , while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families , I believe it has done the opposite . 	0
Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends . 	1
For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights . 	0
Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . 	0
The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . 	0
The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . 	0
To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . 	1
Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . 	1
There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	0
Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . 	0
Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? 	0
From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress . 	1
In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . 	0
No matter how appealing the advertisements are , we should be able to make the decision on our own . 	0
Otherwise the market may be monopolistic , and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective . 	0
The power of advertising maybe over-rated , we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers . 	1
They introduce new products , and provide various choices , not to mention they are often visually enjoyable , since they aim to grab your attention . 	0
Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels , creates a fair environment for commercial competition . 	0
Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
It is rare times when people can learn about this country . 	0
It really help to alleviate the tension . 	1
Besides easing tensions , an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
When they garther together to encourage their team , they will show their patriotic emotions . 	0
Regardless of the competition between teams , their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport . 	0
Moreover , all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media . 	0
They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people . 	0
In Olympic Beijing 2008 , Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country . 	0
First of all , foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students . 	0
They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality , beauty in each cities . 	0
Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . 	0
They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . 	0
By way of conclusion , I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases ; however , the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it . 	1
Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	1
Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
In conclusion , I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress . 	1
I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them . 	0
Because , classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject . 	0
Besides , classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill . 	0
From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations . 	0
However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences . 	1
This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . 	0
Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation . 	0
Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline . 	0
Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency . 	0
Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy . 	0
Early retirement for 55 + employees to help younger people 	0
Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits . 	1
Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case . 	0
I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards . 	1
These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time . 	0
To conclude , it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students . 	1
However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims . 	0
By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves . 	1
And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . 	0
Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . 	0
Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died . 	0
Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family . 	0
I found that I should manage the way that I spend money . 	0
From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted . 	0
Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . 	0
If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs . 	0
Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity . 	1
As a case in point , I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood . 	0
He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money . 	0
His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless . 	0
For example , Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector . 	0
In addition , due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure . 	0
In today ' s context , education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one ' s future . 	0
Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity 	0
There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position . 	0
In my personal opinion , I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses . 	1
Nowadays , both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education . 	0
To begin with , judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular . 	1
Furthermore , female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females . 	1
In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations . 	0
Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis . 	0
Fortunately , some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries . 	0
We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday . 	0
Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing . 	0
Society should ban all forms of the advertising 	0
It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life . 	0
Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers . 	1
First of all , I do support the idea that advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children . 	1
Other critics say that ads have no purpose , they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned . 	0
On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way . 	0
Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age . 	1
Nonetheless , with the development of technology , increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products . 	0
In comfortable conditions , children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change . 	0
Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . 	0
When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . 	0
However , it is not sufficient in itself . 	0
The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising . 	1
Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers . 	0
Advertisements affects on consumer goods 	0
Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . 	1
We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . 	0
In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons . 	1
The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers . 	0
Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century . 	0
Environmental protection vs Economic developments 	0
However , since the budget and the recourse are limited , governments must choose between these two issues . 	0
They are both important because they are vital to human ' s future and welfare . 	0
The following are reasons why . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments . 	1
All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one . 	0
First , environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments . 	1
Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well . 	0
Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she ' s gone . 	0
It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future . 	0
If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . 	1
Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one ' s and widen his horizons , things which aren ' t offered by small towns . 	1
Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants ' lives , hospitals , advanced medical facilities can satisfy one ' s need of medical safety . 	1
Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities , a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities . 	0
Living in big cities or living in small towns 	0
This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people ' s preferences for where to live . 	0
From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people . 	0
First of all , I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive , living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one ' s personality and open one ' s eyes on the real world . 	1
For me , I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones , this personal attitude is the result of many factors . 	1
For me , this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant , slow paced life styles of small towns . 	0
Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day , let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for . 	0
Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	0
It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating . 	0
Personally , I believe such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether . 	1
Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes . 	0
Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society 	0
The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning . 	0
By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce . 	0
Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes . 	1
These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings . 	0
Compassion , a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism , is what distinguishes us human beings from animals . 	0
Economically speaking , such aid could also create a win-win situation . 	1
Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced . 	1
For developed nations , new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations ; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem , promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry . 	0
Should wealthy nations support poor ones ? 	0
Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones , by means of providing infrastructures , or remain bystander of the global poverty , is an issue of controversy . 	0
Personally I think , as the privileged minority , wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor . 	1
In terms of ethics , it is inhumane to watch one ' s fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help , especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so . 	1
We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	0
They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . 	0
They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . 	0
Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . 	1
On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . 	1
If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	0
It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . 	0
Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? 	0
In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints . 	0
Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . 	0
People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . 	0
Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . 	0
Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . 	0
However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . 	0
First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . 	1
Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . 	0
With this situation , some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language . 	1
I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means . 	0
Email and text messaging threats written language 	0
The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . 	0
Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . 	0
In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements . 	1
They make the product preferable . 	1
Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . 	1
Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . 	0
As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	0
The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . 	0
Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . 	0
However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . 	0
When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . 	0
Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . 	0
This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers . 	0
Thus , it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations . 	1
Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely . 	0
To start , non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain . 	1
People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit . 	0
Smoking should be made prohibited in public places 	0
This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers : who are around smoking is taken place . 	0
Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral . 	0
After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public . 	0
Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents . 	0
Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . 	0
Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	0
Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . 	0
Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . 	1
For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	0
I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour . 	0
Work for themselves vs work for employer 	0
Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , I would prefer to have my own job . 	1
My arguments are listed as follows . 	0
First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . 	1
By having my own business , I can manage my own time . 	0
I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . 	0
I can arrange time to travel when I would like . 	0
In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . 	0
Moreover , classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health . 	0
Thus , having classroom could provide abundant skills to students . 	1
And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation . 	1
Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . 	0
This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . 	0
In conclusion , financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries . 	1
Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	1
A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study . 	0
It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards . 	0
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well . 	1
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities . 	1
Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school . 	0
He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance . 	0
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms . 	0
They have numerous activities in school . 	0
For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
In conclusion , more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction . 	1
Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars . 	0
On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it . 	0
We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species . 	1
When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help . 	0
In conclusion , young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage . 	1
Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life . 	1
Furthermore , the city has well-organised lines of transport . 	0
Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits . 	0
Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge . 	1
Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too . 	0
There are not only more jobs , but they are also well-paid . 	0
In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside . 	1
This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places . 	0
Firstly , in the city there is much better education system . 	1
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside . 	1
Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside 	0
People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . 	0
It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity . 	0
In my opinion though , social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago . 	0
The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in . 	0
This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days . 	0
A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones . 	0
The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts . 	0
Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades . 	0
Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world ? 	0
Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in . 	0
Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing . 	0
I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons . 	0
Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success . 	0
Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
Stress , our body ' s way of responding to any kind of demand , can be caused by both good and bad experiences . 	0
Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
However , it is widely thought that we experience stress any time , which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals . 	0
Some people think that life is a struggle , which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives . 	0
What is a very important skill a person should learn 	0
Here are my reasons . 	0
Accordingly , stress management , how to survive our unbearable stress , is the most important skill that we should have . 	1
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . 	0
It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . 	0
That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . 	0
Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being . 	0
In conclusion , both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children ' s future . 	1
At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . 	1
There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . 	0
Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . 	0
Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student . 	0
Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects . 	1
It ' s an essential learning process . 	1
Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . 	0
As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . 	0
The long and the short of it , both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly . 	1
Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run . 	1
The underdeveloped nations , in return , may export local agricultural products , mineral products with discount to the former , boosting each other ' s economy . 	0
In summary , wealthy nations ' offering in need is not only a moral deed , but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways . 	1
Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal . 	1
Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . 	0
Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . 	0
Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type 	0
On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . 	1
The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . 	0
Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance " a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction " . 	1
First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . 	1
Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	1
Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . 	0
Now that , it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children . 	0
For these reasons , I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children . 	1
Instead , this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school , since it helped me to relieve my stress . 	0
In conclusion , of course , the television can have violent programs , however , if children can use Tv programs wisely , there are more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
In addition to what mentioned , medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind . 	1
In conclusion , in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places , technologies facilities , better education and medical services . 	1
But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation , because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly . 	1
This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	0
Every technology has it ’ s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology . 	0
I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . 	0
As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power . 	1
The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . 	0
The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy 	0
Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . 	1
If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	0
Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . 	0
First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . 	1
So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns . 	1
Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge . 	0
First , focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality . 	1
Big city vs small town 	0
I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside . 	1
The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns . 	1
Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life , because the environment that a person grow up , build the personality and his / her culture . 	1
There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc . People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends . 	1
That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions , since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone . 	0
Firstly , the costs outweigh the benefits . 	0
Better education results better career and been well paid . 	0
In fact , some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones . 	0
Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
University education should be only available for good students 	0
However , in my opinion , it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good , knowledgeable learners . 	1
Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level . 	0
Secondly , people can know more about the planet earth itself . 	1
For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . 	0
After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . 	0
In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . 	0
Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . 	0
These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs . 	1
Finally , an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while . 	1
The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ? 	0
There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . 	0
It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . 	0
However , from my point of view , what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society . 	1
It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . 	0
This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed . 	0
In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . 	1
Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . 	0
Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing . 	0
Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue . 	0
Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc . For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job . 	1
These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful . 	0
In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds . 	1
Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast . 	1
World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology , however , there are some negative aspects . 	0
Decade after decade , every day , scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT , such as interactive boards , multicore computers and laptops , tablets , which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones , which have the power of a computer . 	0
There have been significant developments in the field of IT ! 	0
All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth . 	1
Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them . 	0
For those reasons , it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research . 	1
While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society . 	1
Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . 	0
I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons . 	1
We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . 	0
In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	0
Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . 	1
My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . 	0
By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments . 	0
The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching . 	0
They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . 	0
Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	0
To conclude , people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying , doing business and exploring the world . 	1
With valuable information it provides , people can enjoy their lives much more . 	1
Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . 	0
For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	0
Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . 	1
This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . 	0
Thus , to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
In a nutshell , I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own . 	1
It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs . 	0
However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . 	0
It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	0
Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	0
While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . 	1
This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good . 	0
To conclude , I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information , which you use , especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence . 	1
The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the " salt-panic " was over . 	0
Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts . 	1
Secondly , it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations , because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . 	0
For example , several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops . 	0
It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong . 	0
Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! 	0
After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted . 	0
As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back . 	0
In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly . 	0
First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness . 	0
In the following , I will state my reason for this choice . 	0
Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives . 	1
It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities . 	0
There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes . 	0
Financial support for sports and social activities 	0
In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . 	0
Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful . 	0
An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory . 	1
On the other hand , music can help an individual to shape its character . 	1
As a result , I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A + for both biology and chemistry . 	0
In conclusion , I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time . 	1
Also , they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes . 	0
So that , attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore . 	1
Finally , she got very good grade when she was graduation . 	0
Secondly , students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well . 	1
In my experience , many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes . 	0
Also , I had already studied all biology topics before attending university . 	0
The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place , as I said back . 	1
I personaly tend to visit museums when I ' m in a new place because it ' s good for me know about the culture , tradition and history of other places . 	1
Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places , other people don ' t like to visit museums . 	0
Reasons why travelers visit Museums ? 	0
However , other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip . 	1
And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you . 	0
Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations . 	0
And also taking the chance for making friends . 	0
Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . 	1
In coclusion , the museums are a visual source to know the history , tradition and culture of any place in the world . 	1
My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum , it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works , and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums . 	0
People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . 	0
If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . 	0
In addition , job can provide money to us . 	1
Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . 	0
Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . 	0
However , to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills . 	1
An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . 	0
Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . 	0
This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . 	0
The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes . 	0
Should students be required to attend classes ? 	0
In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . 	0
To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	0
Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . 	1
Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! 	0
Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . 	0
Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	1
Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . 	0
Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . 	0
Why people visit museums ? 	0
As a lover of travel , a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour , which can be explained by the following reasons . 	1
Meanwhile , children ' s access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively . 	0
In conclusion , media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere . 	1
So an optional attendance saves time and money . 	0
For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . 	0
In addition , studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax . 	1
Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility 	0
This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	0
Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world . 	1
In conclusion , technology has brought many benefits , but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever . 	1
If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts . 	0
Some universities require students to study in one subject . 	0
On the contrary , others require students to study in several subjects . 	0
Why should human beings travel to outer space ? 	0
For many centuries , outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study . 	0
Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful . 	0
However , a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money , to illustrate , astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment . 	0
On the other hand , there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space . 	1
Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject 	0
For instance , a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat . 	0
Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa . 	0
University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life . 	0
This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all . 	0
For example , pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music . 	0
In my point of view , studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in , they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future . 	1
First of all , when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities . 	0
However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
Economic development vs environment 	0
From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
In addition , people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one . 	1
Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	1
In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	0
Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . 	0
Government and education 	0
Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . 	1
I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees . 	1
It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	0
In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . 	1
They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . 	1
Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . 	0
For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
The following will present my points . 	0
As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . 	0
For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . 	0
Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	1
To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development . 	1
This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages , ideas , or opinions to people . 	0
Nevertheless , the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used . 	0
Is image more powerful than the written word ? 	0
" A picture is worth a thousand words " is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time . 	0
For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . 	0
As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . 	0
Hence , I agree only to certain degree that in today ' s world , image serves as a more effective means of communication . 	1
Firstly , pictures can influence the way people think . 	1
Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . 	0
Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . 	0
In conclusion , it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers . 	1
If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . 	0
To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . 	0
As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . 	0
If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . 	0
First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . 	1
In my opinion , we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons . 	1
But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? 	0
As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . 	0
In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . 	0
Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals 	0
In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . 	1
Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	0
My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . 	0
Furthermore , they are more flexible . 	0
If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	0
He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . 	0
If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . 	0
Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . 	0
There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . 	0
They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . 	0
When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically . 	1
In a nutshell , although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures , some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time . 	1
Therefore , to make use of time , if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do . 	1
In conclusion , taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it . 	1
Therefore , parents should encourage students to take the part-time job . 	1
It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted . 	0
Classmates ' impacts on children ' s performance at school 	0
It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments . 	0
Their success should be attributed to many different external factors . 	0
To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children . 	1
However , in my opinion , the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements . 	1
From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances . 	0
In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same . 	0
It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents . 	0
To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none . 	1
They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment , but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them . 	1
All in all , I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood . 	1
In my point of view , I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school . 	1
Studying harder in school , getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge , which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job . 	0
However , someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job . 	1
I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future . 	0
But imagine it , a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people , and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former , which person do you want to be ? 	0
Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments ? 	0
Live football game at a stadium 	0
If you have a great love with football and your home team , it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone . 	1
Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team ' s match , yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there ? 	0
Before the match starts , thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags , colorful outfits , sound of trumpets and rattles . . . everywhere . 	0
First , attending a live football match is very fulfilling . 	1
You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40 , 000 people at the stadium , such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home . 	0
As the game kicks off , the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting . 	0
See , you will be bored if you are watching it alone . 	0
Everybody yells and sings together , the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored . 	0
Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws . 	1
Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries . 	1
I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression . 	1
Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . 	0
Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . 	0
I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life . 	1
Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life 	0
Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . 	0
It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think . 	1
Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . 	0
So , relating well to people is also another important factor . 	1
Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult . 	0
But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . 	1
Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
Mitigating process , no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home . 	1
Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	1
From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities , both are crucial on the way to a brighter future . 	1
An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents . 	0
Furthermore , most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want . 	0
Relatively , these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost . 	0
They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand . 	0
Therefore , I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones . 	0
This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person ’ s education and character . 	1
I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path . 	1
In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry . 	1
As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . 	0
Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	0
Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . 	1
The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . 	0
There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . 	0
Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons . 	1
Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . 	0
This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . 	0
It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life . 	1
A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . 	0
He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . 	0
If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . 	1
Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling ? 	0
In my opinion , it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students . 	1
Although , many argue that it provide good working experience , but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways . 	1
Having jobs would affect the health of the student . 	1
In a nutshell , the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable . 	1
I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing . 	0
To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
Establishing a new university in your community 	0
I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community . 	1
There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies , creation of jobs . 	1
However , they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems . 	0
Undoubtedly , the university will have to hire professors , employees and etc . Thus , a number vacant positions need to be filled . 	0
Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community . 	0
Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes . 	1
In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions . 	0
Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them . 	1
All in all , protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently , but also contributes to the next generation . 	1
This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . 	0
For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . 	0
The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines 	0
Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . 	0
With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . 	0
Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . 	0
But many other still thinks they are going to stay . 	0
I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time . 	1
I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news . 	1
A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . 	0
The main disadvantage is contamination . 	1
For example , the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers ' accommodation need . 	0
First of all , a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate . 	1
From my point of view , the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories . 	1
There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace . 	0
This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers . 	0
If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks . 	0
If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder . 	0
The more money , the more chances . 	0
Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks . 	1
This fact pushes them to work faster and faster . 	0
For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary . 	0
Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased . 	1
If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money . 	0
He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him . 	0
My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working . 	0
Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other . 	0
It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together . 	0
Should universities accept equal number of males / females or not 	0
Education is important for the development of the world . 	0
Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not . 	0
However , since both genders are equally important , both must be given equal opportunities . 	0
Universities must admit both in equal numbers , depending on their choices . 	1
Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females . 	0
The whole world aims for women empowerment , and to achieve this , females should be given equal opportunities as males . 	1
When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop . 	0
For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability . 	0
I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore . 	0
Second , by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving . 	1
However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine . 	1
These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world . 	0
To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . 	0
From their point of view , the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers , and , furthermore , labors for graduates are in short supply . 	0
What is worse , the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying . 	0
In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time-consuming . 	1
Young people should go to university or not 	0
Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university . 	0
In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . 	0
In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision . 	0
The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . 	0
The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . 	0
First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . 	1
It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . 	0
However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace . 	0
Be wise and conscious . 	0
Little wonder , then , that by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes . 	0
Further more , they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted . 	0
This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living . 	1
It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives . 	0
Meanwhile , not all celebrities are role models . 	0
Celebrities , for example movie stars , are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend , etc . It is human nature that people , especially youngsters , are attracted to the celebrities they favour , and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible . 	0
Drugs , alcohol and messy sex lives 	0
The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard . 	0
But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children . 	1
This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police . 	0
Of course , some celebrities , e . g . writers , passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world . 	1
Worse still , without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living . 	1
An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise . 	0
Furthermore , temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season . 	0
Primarily , authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars . 	0
Meanwhile , cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice . 	0
Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems . 	0
In conclusion , addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate , while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable , plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised . 	1
In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture . 	1
Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds . 	0
Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken . 	1
For instance , there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature . 	0
Furthermore , the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development . 	1
For example , as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills . 	0
In the first place , spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills . 	0
As a result , it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently . 	1
Moreover , continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture . 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life . 	0
Mobile phones : faster communication vs social problems 	0
However , I believe , this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society . 	1
Indeed , mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages . 	0
Having one ' s own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits . 	1
First , having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit . 	1
Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze , so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted . 	0
My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company . 	0
People should have hobbies and do physical activities 	0
Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question . 	0
Different people have different ideas . 	0
Some people think we should focus on our jobs , but I don ' t agree with them . 	0
He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise . 	0
When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend , he made up his mind to loose weight . 	0
Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better . 	1
Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried , this might be ended in disappointment . 	0
I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning , his improvement of ability , with regard to cooperation and express his opinion , is unpromising . 	0
knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened . 	0
Finally , of course , being without a teacher has shortcomings . 	1
Furthermore , the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction . 	0
Moreover , This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree . 	0
Secondly , in my mind , the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	1
We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself . 	0
Last , we should develop at least one personal hobby , not to show off , but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured . 	1
Playing musical instrument is a good way , I can play classical guitar . 	0
Humans are not robots ; we can ' t keep working for twenty-four hours . 	0
Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries . 	0
Also , doing something for a long time can be boring , having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind . 	1
For example , at school , students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class . 	0
He started to jog every morning . 	0
After a moth , he is thinner and finds a girlfriend . 	0
When I meet difficulties in studies , I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves . 	0
It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence . 	0
In conclusion , I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them . 	1
After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia . 	0
For example , Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia . 	0
Nowadays information plays an important role in our world . 	0
Gossip-based information 	0
Some people say : " information is power " . 	1
It has become a product , which can be sold , bought , or stolen . 	0
I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons . 	0
That ' s why it is so important to be well-informed . 	0
Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information . 	0
The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability . 	1
For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . 	0
Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . 	0
First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . 	1
This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors . 	0
It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth . 	1
These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . 	0
Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . 	0
Effect of celebrities on youth 	0
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years . 	1
Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . 	0
This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	0
New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . 	0
As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . 	0
After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	1
To sum up , I admire my father ' s choice , while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert , like my mom , I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life . 	1
Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . 	0
With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . 	0
On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . 	0
Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . 	0
Students can have opportunity to learn , to practice , to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future . 	1
Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have . 	1
Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university . 	1
In conclusion , I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal . 	1
For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . 	0
Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . 	0
Teachers could augment their quality . 	0
Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . 	1
Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . 	0
Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . 	0
Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . 	1
Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	0
In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance . 	1
As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	0
So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome . 	0
Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	0
While we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience . 	1
In conclusion , I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient . 	1
While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . 	0
Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	1
Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . 	0
Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . 	1
However , there are also disadvantages . 	0
A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . 	1
When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . 	0
For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . 	0
Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . 	1
It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . 	0
Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . 	0
Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	0
When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . 	0
Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . 	0
First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . 	0
This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . 	1
As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	0
In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . 	0
With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year . 	0
should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? 	0
From my perspective , fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles . 	1
However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . 	0
Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	1
Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . 	0
On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . 	1
For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co-operative compared to living in university dormitories . 	0
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . 	0
I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students . 	1
And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
However , some people point that technology has made children less creative . 	0
I don ' t deny that technology may have some negative effects on children , but I think technology makes children even more creative . 	1
First , technology inspires children to create new things . 	0
Children are curious about everything around them , so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works . 	0
Technology inspires children ' s creativity instead of weakening it 	0
Technology accelerates human ' s evolving pace . 	0
With advanced technology , many things that seemed impossible in the past , have become realities . 	0
For example , people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen , both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet . 	0
For example , Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked . 	0
After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer . 	0
By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	0
By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . 	0
Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . 	0
Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages 	0
In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex . 	1
Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . 	0
By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . 	1
School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . 	0
They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . 	0
In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . 	0
Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . 	0
Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone 	0
As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons . 	0
In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . 	0
Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . 	0
To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . 	0
Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	1
Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . 	0
In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . 	0
Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . 	1
Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . 	1
Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	0
Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . 	0
Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . 	0
It will meliorate not only mental and body health , but also will establish in children a habit of doing it , giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules . 	1
Including physical activity in children ' s school day should be strongly considered . 	1
Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . 	1
To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	0
For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	0
In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . 	1
In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . 	0
Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	0
Haste makes waste 	0
This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one . 	1
In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons : For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . 	0
Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . 	1
According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered . 	0
First , conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history . 	1
If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment , I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below . 	0
Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment 	0
Furthermore , supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually . 	1
In short , the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will . 	0
If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms . 	0
What ' s more , rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries . 	0
Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society . 	0
Nowadays , an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation ; therefore , sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising . 	0
However , it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first . 	0
I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost . 	1
These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age . 	0
As a matter of fact , I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten . 	0
If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0
Thus , people have a good quality life . 	0
Therefore , criminal rate were drop . 	0
When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . 	0
So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . 	0
These impact on every living creature in the world . 	0
Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . 	0
Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . 	0
For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . 	0
Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . 	1
Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	0
In conclusion , although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children , it seem to me that the effects of learning music , sports are profound . 	1
So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company ( for example , toys company ) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need . 	1
In my opinion , I think buying habit is people ' s choice to make , not entirely affected by advertisements . 	1
But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop , it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising . 	0
Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment . 	0
This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . 	0
I think it ' s fun and educational . 	1
But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools . 	0
In conclusion , traditional learning still has many benefits to the students . 	1
Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	0
To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . 	1
Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it . 	1
In conclusion , the good technology bringing to us is undeniable . 	1
Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . 	0
In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . 	0
Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . 	0
In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	0
Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team . 	0
Giving mobile phones to the unemployed 	0
Today , the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many . 	0
Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . 	0
They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money . 	0
Nevertheless , I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money . 	1
In a positive point of view , when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities . 	0
For example , they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them . 	0
With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job . 	0
Not only that , the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with . 	0
In short , if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive . 	1
If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity . 	0
Therefore , it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources . 	1
Firstly , the major source of energy today is water . 	0
Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source . 	0
To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short . 	0
Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India . 	0
Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy 	0
The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past . 	0
It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly . 	0
I will analyze these areas in the essay . 	0
On top of that , till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment . 	1
To put it in a nutshell , the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment . 	1
To illustrate this further , the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living . 	0
To conclude , the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed . 	1
Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money . 	0
This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country . 	0
Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones . 	0
In this context , the public ' s money is spent worthlessly . 	0
Furthermore , when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity . 	1
It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless . 	0
There are many advantage of these invention , telephones and email . 	0
Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required 	0
I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication , telephones and email , made people less personal . 	1
Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier . 	1
To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . 	1
I will give several reasons to support my opinion . 	0
I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . 	0
Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . 	0
Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . 	0
For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . 	0
I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	0
But people should be careful with what they eat , because some industrial foods are very bad for their health , so they should buy only food from well known brands . 	1
To my mind , there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual ' s life . 	1
All in all , that ease to prepare food has improved people ’ s lives . 	1
And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology . 	0
For example , if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions . 	0
Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time . 	0
Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . 	0
At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . 	0
So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	1
Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . 	1
Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out 	0
As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own . 	0
But , the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one . 	0
Personally , I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . 	0
Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . 	0
Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance . 	0
This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . 	0
Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . 	0
Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience , you won ’ t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited . 	1
If someday I have children , I ’ m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it . 	1
" Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " 	0
Capital punishment ; 51% countries have polished death penalty 	0
In the whole world , 51% countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98% in Europe . 	0
In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . 	0
However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . 	0
Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . 	0
Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . 	0
Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons . 	1
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
By way of conclusion , it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases . 	1
However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished . 	0
They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . 	0
It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	0
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library . 	1
In spite of the importance of sports activities , libraries are more important . 	1
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . 	0
More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . 	0
A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . 	0
Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . 	0
Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	0
Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . 	1
It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . 	0
A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money 	0
Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income . 	1
Each individual visualize success differently . 	0
People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology ; nevertheless , behind the glamorous facade of it , what we loss will never be returned . 	1
The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . 	0
Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . 	0
In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . 	0
In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . 	0
It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . 	1
Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . 	0
I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children . 	1
In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . 	0
In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible . 	1
However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	0
It ' s just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident . 	0
In conclusion , criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism . 	1
And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . 	0
You should have your own judgments too ! 	0
Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . 	0
In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . 	1
Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? 	0
What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? 	0
For the above-mentioned reasons , I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood , which will be beneficial to our community . 	1
Accordingly , with sales promotion , it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy . 	0
In addition , the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes . 	0
Lastly , it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center , and save our time on the other hand . 	1
There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers . 	0
It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job . 	0
Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money . 	0
Computers expose children to vulgar materials . 	0
Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc . are some of its demerits , from a countless list . 	0
However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	0
You can study any time you want . 	0
In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . 	0
The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . 	0
Studying at home by using technology is convenient . 	1
Here are my reasons . 	0
I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . 	1
Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school 	0
Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . 	0
First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . 	0
Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels . 	0
From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm . 	0
Furthermore , it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs . 	1
There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall . 	0
Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated , with a bright and independent mind . 	0
In conclusion , as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well . 	1
Furthermore , this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses . 	1
When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education . 	0
Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude . 	0
Because of the technology of internet and air transportation , businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions . 	0
This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue . 	0
Besides , advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard . 	1
With the improvement of medical technology , it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before , and many serious diseases are under control . 	0
Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect 	0
In the past few decades , there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals , although bringing some disadvantages to us . 	1
On one hand , the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards . 	1
Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools , which play an important role in economic activity . 	0
Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies , and this means that we could get more happiness from technology . 	0
On the other hand , the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society . 	1
Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . 	0
Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? 	0
Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons . 	0
However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . 	0
About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . 	0
In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . 	0
Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	1
Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . 	0
With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . 	0
Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . 	1
Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get . 	1
Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . 	0
Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . 	0
This problem should not be happened . 	0
Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	1
I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	0
The traffic in the city was too crowed . 	0
Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . 	0
We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places . 	1
There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	0
I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . 	0
I also love the environment in here . 	1
Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic , people and of course the environment . 	1
If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . 	0
You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . 	0
Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . 	0
Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	0
These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . 	0
The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . 	1
In the end , I think any great success need great work not great luck , even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans . 	1
Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	0
Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . 	0
Those who disagree , believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects . 	1
As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family . 	0
Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country . 	1
They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments . 	0
Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception . 	0
Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world ; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue . 	0
Effects of globalization 	0
In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	1
In addition , they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries . 	0
Moreover , the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization . 	1
There are many ways of teaching . 	0
Sports activities can improve mental health as well . 	1
Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises . 	0
Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies , such as reading , watching movies , or working in their gardens , I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise , which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions . 	1
Therefore , it is necessary for many to find ways to relax . 	0
In modern society , people often face many difficulties under great stress . 	0
The best way to relax is by exercises 	0
The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity . 	0
Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body . 	0
Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system . 	0
It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health . 	1
While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas . 	0
However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . 	0
In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act . 	0
Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . 	0
Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . 	0
Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	0
In conclusion , it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence . 	1
Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . 	0
As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . 	0
It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . 	0
Some students enjoy taking part in some research . 	0
No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills . 	0
He also has access to the most up-to-date language . 	0
On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives . 	0
He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country . 	0
Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language . 	0
Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way . 	0
Person ' A ' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method . 	1
In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country . 	0
Where to learn a new language ? 	0
Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries . 	1
On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . 	1
Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . 	0
Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . 	0
As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	1
On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . 	0
An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . 	0
Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . 	0
Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence . 	0
Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? 	0
The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . 	0
Therefore , we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge . 	0
Therefore , past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times . 	1
Secondly , people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes . 	1
As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones . 	0
Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life . 	0
Although it is true that life changes rapidly , there are many things in the past that we can learn about , such as mistakes , success and knowledge in many fields of study . 	1
First of all , the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past . 	0
Success and knowledge 	0
Many people think that " Past has nothing to do with present , as time never stops , the next generations are completely different from the predecessors " . 	0
Improving facilities is the best way 	0
If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals , others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way . 	0
By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them . 	0
Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities , while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students . 	0
The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage 	0
Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one ' s personal as well as professional life . 	0
The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university . 	0
Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage . 	0
Both the points of views will be discussed in order . 	0
On the one hand , the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous . 	0
For one , it helps working people to maintain work life balance . 	0
The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby . 	0
People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours . 	0
For students too , studying from home is an attractive option . 	0
For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
Once student ' s starts earning , they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence . 	0
They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment . 	0
There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education . 	0
Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education , which will help them to get a better job and salaries . 	0
This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification . 	0
In my view point , I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education . 	1
Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working . 	1
They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature . 	0
On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	0
Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . 	0
I , for one , strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . 	1
First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . 	0
As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . 	1
To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . 	0
Should people be forced to stop working ? 	0
The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . 	0
Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . 	0
In my personal point of view , the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old . 	1
In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . 	0
They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . 	0
In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity . 	1
After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	0
Those activities have proven that women can also do the men ' s works . 	0
Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned . 	0
For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood . 	0
We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines . 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . 	1
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	0
Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . 	1
I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . 	0
For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . 	0
Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . 	0
But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . 	0
On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . 	1
Government should take interim measures , to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit . 	0
In conclusion , I am firmly supporting the view , that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects , provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender . 	1
We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place . 	1
The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . 	0
For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . 	0
These machines reduce the physical work done by humans . 	0
There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives . 	0
First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . 	1
When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . 	0
You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . 	0
People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? 	0
Machines - positive or negative for humans 	0
They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . 	0
One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about . 	1
Moreover , some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication . 	0
It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people . 	1
For example , in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days . 	0
Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans . 	0
Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached . 	0
Mobile phones are not out of expectation . 	0
First of all , almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems . 	1
What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other . 	0
Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive . 	0
Nowadays , the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well , such as social , medical and technical problems . 	0
Effects of mobile phones 	0
In this essay , I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint . 	0
However , I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones . 	1
Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances . 	0
They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched . 	0
It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal . 	1
Nevertheless , it is not impossible to solve these problems , as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented . 	0
Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group . 	0
In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality . 	1
To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . 	0
Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	0
Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . 	0
For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . 	0
Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . 	1
First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . 	0
The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . 	0
It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge . 	1
Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development . 	0
Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . 	0
However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . 	0
The popularity of news media 	0
Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . 	0
People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . 	0
This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . 	0
Through face-to-face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students . 	0
Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can . 	1
As a result , information from those sources is subject to question . 	1
Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts . 	0
On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . 	0
Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children . 	0
Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate . 	1
This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments . 	0
With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future . 	0
Computers replace human teachers 	0
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood . 	0
Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . 	0
So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	1
Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . 	0
With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . 	0
People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . 	0
Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	0
There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . 	0
Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . 	0
We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	0
Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . 	1
One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility , specially in financially matters . 	0
For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1
So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues . 	1
To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked . 	0
Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject . 	0
Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children . 	0
Should teenagers learn all school subjects / focus on one subject 	0
Presently , it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school . 	0
The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized . 	1
In the first place , with some basic knowledge of diverse fields , students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future . 	0
While , others claim that studying only one subject is more effective . 	0
Before rendering my own opinion , I will explore sides of this topic . 	0
Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate . 	0
In students ' point of view , the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes . 	0
If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy , you will be " on site " to witness and celebrate the victory . 	0
Furthermore , it can be an exclusive experience . 	0
It can be unforgettable moments in your life . 	1
The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne . 	0
In conclusion , watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing , but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable . 	1
You can watch it at home , but " easy come , easy go " , you will quickly forget it , like a movie . 	0
Second , watching a live football game is an exceptional experience . 	1
You can cherish your experience for a long time . 	0
I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth . 	1
The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive , but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game . 	0
If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . 	0
That also make money flow , and then economics become better . 	0
It benefits to a certain country . 	1
In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives . 	1
For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
Its convenience saves our time . 	1
Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages . 	0
Hence I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher . 	0
In addition , the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework , Nevertheless , I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself . 	1
Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies . 	1
In other words , when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly . 	0
In addition , professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study . 	0
Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	0
Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them . 	0
As for the learning by yourself , it has some certain profit . 	0
It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you , and your learning becomes more profound . 	0
For example , if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher . 	0
There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor . 	1
By the way , if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ! 	0
It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own . 	0
There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes . 	1
For example , from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly . 	0
I can utilize them as tutorials for many things . 	0
In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite . 	0
In sum , sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own . 	1
For instance , I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites . 	0
Is it necessary for children or not ? 	0
Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn . 	0
Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language . 	0
They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies . 	0
Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories , but can extend their visions about the other countries . 	1
First , the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life . 	0
For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars . 	0
So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own . 	0
On the other hand by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services . 	1
Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what ’ s the best for us . 	0
These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising . 	1
For example , tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic ' s economy . 	0
In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers . 	0
Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country . 	0
In conclusion , I think that modern society needs advertising . 	1
Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services , but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way . 	1
Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? 	0
When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . 	0
As house heating is a major need in the winter time , some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes . 	0
If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation . 	0
Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments . 	1
So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support . 	1
In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment . 	0
Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment . 	0
As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation . 	0
Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life . 	0
As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health . 	1
In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me . 	0
Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends . 	0
Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person . 	0
However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor . 	0
If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
Moreover , he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories . 	0
For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years . 	0
There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly . 	0
In other words , childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life . 	1
Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn . 	0
Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy . 	1
There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun . 	0
Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people . 	1
I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy . 	0
For instance , I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture . 	0
Secondly , dancing can represent to civilization of that culture . 	1
All this is a civilization of their culture . 	0
The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance . 	0
And dancing is one of that ways . 	1
Thirdly , many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves . 	0
For example , many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song . 	0
Both people who see and dance also have a good time . 	0
But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . 	0
His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses . 	0
Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults . 	0
When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view , they will not be able to ask him for advice . 	0
To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
In conclusion , I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents , because of the benefits they will have . 	1
They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate . 	1
Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
Moreover , if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices , therefore they might hit consumer ' s life . 	1
For instance , a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die . 	0
Firstly , if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants . 	1
As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances . 	0
However , I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit . 	1
With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit . 	1
Businesses should be only concerned about making profits . 	0
There is no doubt that companies , factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people ' s need and make a profit for their managers . 	0
Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . 	0
Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . 	0
First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . 	1
For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . 	0
Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I think choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career . 	1
In conclusion , all companies , factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive , and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit . 	1
They can hit both the environment and human ' s life easily . 	1
Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way . 	0
In conclusion , installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries . 	0
In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well . 	0
Therefore , how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it . 	1
However , it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society . 	0
For instance , in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems , such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances . 	0
It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry , such as water pollution , overcrowded traffic and medical problems . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
Living in a higher pace is better 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
In conclusion , I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to . 	1
Besides , we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague . 	1
In addition , the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments . 	0
To conclude , as far as I am concerned , international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries . 	1
Thus , tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes . 	1
In conclusion , i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one . 	1
As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	0
I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences . 	1
For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	0
In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . 	0
large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . 	1
Third , I love travelling around the world . 	0
Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field , the research takes up too much teaching time . 	1
As far as I am concerned , professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research . 	1
The precondition of doing research by professors 	0
Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities . 	0
If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes . 	0
The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies . 	0
However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life . 	1
In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas . 	1
In this way , professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students . 	0
Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research . 	1
Finally , human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine . 	0
Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable . 	0
We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks . 	0
Firstly , day by day population is increasing , so human needs for food is increasing as well . 	0
Secondly , people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals , so they need land to build their houses on it . 	1
Therefore , farmlands are vital for human life . 	1
Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that . 	0
Some people think that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more 	0
From my point of view although endangered animals are important , human needs should be considered more . 	1
Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals . 	0
Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . 	1
Distance-learning vs . attending school in person 	0
A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . 	0
From my perspective , online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions . 	1
To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . 	1
In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . 	0
Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . 	0
Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . 	0
Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . 	1
I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . 	0
Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation . 	1
How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ? 	0
It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health . 	1
What ' s even worse , according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies . 	0
Recently , more and more children smoke because they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies . 	0
Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad , therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity . 	0
Moreover , sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children . 	0
I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying . 	0
I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook . 	0
As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages . 	0
Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime . 	0
First of all , to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers . 	0
Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons . 	0
Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence . 	1
As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . 	0
The internet has been more and more popular for recent years , providing people with a huge source of information . 	0
Will newspapers become a thing of the past ? 	0
Another point is that , from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one . 	0
Hence , the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information . 	1
Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility ? 	0
Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . 	0
Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . 	0
However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . 	0
In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one ’ s needs but transportation . 	0
One important thing that I want to change about my hometown 	0
Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . 	0
And this problem seem to get worst . 	0
At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . 	1
So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation . 	1
Since I ’ m facing the traffic congestion every day . 	1
First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished . 	0
I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me . 	0
The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community . 	0
Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention , but this argument is invalid . 	0
That ' s not enough , for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance . 	0
Government budget focus , young children or university ? 	0
" Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long-lasting prosperity . 	0
As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both . 	1
However , other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing . 	0
In my opinion , the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons . 	1
Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
For a long time , the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals . 	0
At a higher level , it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand . 	0
This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels . 	0
First of all , the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners . 	1
With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile . 	0
People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0
However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . 	0
I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line . 	0
However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself . 	0
I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger . 	0
Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on . 	0
I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying . 	1
When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself . 	0
He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal . 	0
For these reasons , I agree that one should not give up , as the true reward is to have the dignity . 	1
Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life . 	1
So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0
When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . 	0
Then , many people did not have money . 	0
First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication . 	0
Mobile phone ; " Iron man " / " Weichat " - destroy social interactions ? 	0
However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems . 	1
Indeed , mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages , bringing convenience and entertainment into our life . 	0
In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . 	0
In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . 	1
Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as " Iron man " . 	0
Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children . 	0
For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . 	0
In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . 	0
It enriches people ' s knowledge with worldwide information . 	0
It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects . 	0
This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . 	0
Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	0
In conclusion , the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people . 	1
It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news . 	0
Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	1
In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . 	1
It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . 	0
Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . 	0
For example , if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch . 	0
Secondly , when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food . 	1
Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook . 	0
Firstly , people normally have lots of things to do . 	0
Because of that , they don ’ t have much time to spend in the kitchen . 	0
But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome . 	1
Easy preparation of food leads to a better life 	0
The Technology has developed a lot . 	0
With that development , food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to . 	0
With that change , people ’ s lives are a lot better for several reasons . 	0
For instance , further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health . 	0
In addition to this , introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing . 	1
After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka , it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement . 	1
As this shows , smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems . 	0
It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries . 	0
Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . 	0
Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . 	1
. 	0
Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	1
Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . 	0
So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them . 	1
Other than that , they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way . 	1
In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . 	0
So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department . 	0
There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited . 	0
Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force . 	0
In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support . 	0
It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough . 	0
Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time . 	1
There ' s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book , watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy . 	0
Admittedly , indoor activities are fun . 	1
After all , people are people and we have our own propensity . 	0
Although I can also have fun in indoor activities , this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities . 	1
Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . 	1
If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	0
Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	1
If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . 	0
Second , not all of serious movies are boring . 	0
" Click " is a very interesting comedy , with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses . 	0
Serious or entertaining movies 	0
I prefer the serious movies which are simple , touching and powerful . 	1
Here are my reasons . 	0
First , most serious movies have a wide variety of content . 	1
Entertaining movies are created to amuse people . 	0
However , most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical . 	0
Compared with the entertainment film , the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful . 	0
Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love , humaneness ; moreover , it may point out the dark sides of the society . 	0
Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	1
On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . 	0
Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself . 	0
In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . 	1
Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . 	0
" Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . 	0
The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click . 	0
More , even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close . 	0
Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient . 	0
While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions . 	0
The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely . 	1
However , I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people . 	1
As technology develops , it has negative influences in many respects . 	0
Nowadays , the variety of communication systems used widely . 	0
Man to man interaction changed 	0
Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology , technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network . 	0
Furthermore , technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends . 	0
Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources , I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge . 	1
It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge . 	0
Teachers lesson vs other sources 	0
The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change . 	0
Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs . 	0
Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly 	0
Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced . 	0
A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time . 	0
Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning . 	1
There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . 	0
On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities . 	0
Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline . 	0
Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study . 	0
In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects . 	0
It is adverse to the whole academic field . 	0
Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research . 	1
On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . 	1
Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	1
Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research . 	0
For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car . 	0
If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . 	0
This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . 	0
Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . 	0
And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education . 	0
Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . 	0
Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? 	0
Personally speaking , it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one . 	1
Stroke , heart disorders , hearing loss , and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers . 	0
When they are around the active smokers , they will inhale hazardous smoke . 	0
Last but not least , passive smokers will have a lot of health risks . 	0
The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies . 	0
Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders ' health , especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs . 	1
Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something . 	0
Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children . 	1
State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant ' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals . 	0
In conclusion , smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged . 	1
Educational rights must be given to both genders . 	0
Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit , irrespective of the gender . 	0
Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . 	1
This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	0
I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . 	0
For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . 	0
Moreover , I learn money management . 	0
This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . 	0
From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . 	0
When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . 	0
By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . 	0
I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . 	0
A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40% , which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic . 	0
That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides . 	0
First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring . 	1
In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor . 	0
Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies . 	1
In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country . 	0
Should all the advertisements be banned ? 	0
Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information . 	0
Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public . 	0
My view is that while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring . 	1
Undoubtedly , math , language , science and history are all extremely important subjects in student ' s education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world . 	0
Younger school children should study art and music 	0
Nevertheless , the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays . 	1
Therefore , some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students . 	0
First of all , art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful . 	1
In this case , I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study . 	1
Under this circumstance , learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures . 	0
It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures . 	0
To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages . 	1
For instance , students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played . 	0
Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . 	1
Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . 	0
Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes . 	0
Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	0
However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . 	0
In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
They have more opportunities , profits , and authorities . 	1
There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages , too , but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable . 	1
For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed . 	0
Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation . 	0
When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want . 	0
Finally , there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others . 	1
In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . 	0
Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . 	1
Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . 	0
Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated 	0
Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more . 	1
Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . 	0
First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . 	1
In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view . 	0
Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	0
With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . 	0
Furthermore , the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas . 	0
In a nutshell , varied characteristics of various people , feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life . 	1
Thereafter , the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also . 	0
Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones . 	0
Secondly , the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time . 	1
At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life . 	0
In my opinion , the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue . 	1
It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living . 	0
The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed , so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise . 	0
Last but not least , the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment . 	0
While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion . 	1
However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . 	0
There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . 	0
Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? 	0
However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . 	0
Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	0
Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . 	1
One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . 	0
Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	1
To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . 	0
Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry . 	0
Therefore , some lands should be assigned to industry . 	1
I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland , housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	1
To conclude , the population of endangered animals are less than people ' s population , so they do not need so much land that people need . 	1
First , making college education free would cost too much . 	1
However , I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college . 	0
Should the Government Provide Free College ? 	0
Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds . 	0
In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education . 	0
There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools . 	0
It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth . 	0
Not everyone wants to go to a college . 	0
Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college . 	0
For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . 	0
We should make full use of the past , instead of ignoring it , for a better and brighter future . 	0
How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth ' s gravity without the apple which fall on Newton ' s head . 	0
They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us . 	0
We cannot ignore them in any way . 	0
All in all , the past ' s mistakes , success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people ' s lives today . 	1
For instance , Edison ' s statement " Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration " is still helpful for everyone today , and probably in the future . 	0
Last but not least , the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge , inventions . 	1
If it had not been for those knowledge in the past , we could never be as modern as today . 	0
How can America be the world ' s leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India . 	0
Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	1
To sum up , TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation . 	1
As well as it ' s one way of recent communications , based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people . 	1
Moreover , TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV , WDTV using Skype , tango and other apps . 	0
In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends ; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV . 	1
It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema . 	0
Third , TV can be one of communication ways . 	0
However , if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned , advertisements would be welcomed by more . 	0
Taken all together , advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth . 	1
We can not deny all of them . 	0
Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies . 	1
Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides . 	0
It is targeted for children to teenager . 	0
For example , in Korea , there ' s program called EBS . 	0
However , I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
Many people say that television has negative effects on children , since it can be violent or inappropriate for children . 	0
Nowadays , we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv . 	0
Tv has NO negative effects on children 	0
If children can use those programs wisely , they can learn many information from it . 	0
Not only the up-to-date news , but also there are many programs which has educational purposes . 	0
First of all , television has useful and educational programs . 	1
There are two reasons to support my idea . 	0
In my opinion , one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons . 	1
While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas . 	0
As a result , the project cannot being done . 	0
In condition , doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily . 	0
Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth 	0
During my all vacations , I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter . 	0
If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . 	0
As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . 	0
For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds . 	1
In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . 	0
Here is a positive example : Queens Center Mall , a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City , provides a wide vairtey of stores , products and services , from clothing to electronics and restaurants , that consumers can choose . 	0
It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York . 	0
I found that I could find virtually every brand or store , including Macy ' s and JCPenney , when I visited there . 	0
As far as I am concerned , a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time . 	1
The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . 	0
I believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community 	0
I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community . 	1
The following are my reasons . 	0
In the first place , the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping . 	0
It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	0
After all , charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected . 	0
Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . 	1
By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	0
Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . 	0
In conclusion , people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary . 	1
With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition . 	0
For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . 	0
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to spend money on improving facilities . 	1
For example , library is a good place for students to study or research . 	0
They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize . 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers , and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
It can influence us in different aspects of life . 	0
In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way . 	1
Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior . 	0
Moreover , communication is as well making a good roommate . 	0
It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member . 	0
One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project . 	0
People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning . 	0
Therefore , communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation . 	1
It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	0
In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject . 	1
For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	0
If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk . 	0
In contrast , young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually . 	1
They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want . 	0
The sky is the limit ; there are all kinds of personality out there . 	0
We need to be flexible to be account into society . 	0
People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds . 	0
Third , there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government . 	1
People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education . 	0
While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial . 	0
They also provide funds for academic research . 	0
They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students . 	0
In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means . 	0
Otherwise , it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government . 	1
In short , the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice . 	1
Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . 	0
It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . 	1
First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . 	1
When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted . 	0
Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . 	0
In my opinion , the latter opinion is true . 	0
Computer has negative effects to children 	0
Nowadays , thanks to the development of technology , computer is now indispensable to life . 	0
For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non-stop playing for 3 days . 	0
Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . 	1
However , I think traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society . 	1
One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills . 	0
With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . 	0
In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . 	0
Traditional games or modern games in developing children ' s skills 	0
Games have played a key role in children ' s growth , especially in terms of their abilities . 	0
This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future . 	0
At the same time , children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative . 	0
For me , I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games . 	1
It is true that modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend . 	1
In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . 	1
Besides , learning abilities of student are different . 	1
In conclusion , the time-saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals . 	1
Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . 	0
More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . 	0
This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	1
Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly . 	1
If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace . 	0
For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly . 	0
I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons . 	0
Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice . 	1
To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study . 	1
Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter . 	0
More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes 	0
Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully . 	0
These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company . 	0
Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before . 	1
The reasons are the followings . 	0
Capitalism enfranchised people ' s right to own properties , and consequently , their rights to use them . 	0
Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . 	1
From another point of view , traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban ; so it is out of drivers ' control . 	0
Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour 	0
Started in the late eighteenth century , the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles . 	0
The very fuel that they rely on , oil , has now become the dominant pollution of cities ' environment . 	0
While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts , I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them . 	1
Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time ? 	0
Wars are notorious , but you can ' t blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries . 	0
All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	0
With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . 	0
According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . 	0
Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . 	1
In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	0
Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . 	0
It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . 	0
Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . 	1
Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . 	1
Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . 	0
In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . 	0
And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . 	0
Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . 	0
Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . 	0
In my opinion , governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating . 	1
First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . 	1
Improve roads or public transports 	0
Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation . 	0
Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares . 	0
These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . 	0
The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	0
But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts . 	1
Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical . 	0
Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level . 	0
Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate . 	0
However , in my perspective , both public services and arts worth investment . 	1
It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing . 	1
As can be seen from this , is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one . 	1
That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him . 	0
The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working . 	0
Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns . 	0
Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success . 	0
In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . 	0
Despite the importance of working in team , I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant . 	1
Work in team or independently 	0
Nowadays , as the world is getting smaller , we need to be able to cooperate . 	0
Moreover , even when people watch television together , there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television . 	1
Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone . 	0
Thus , it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness . 	0
To illustrate my point , it is reported that most of people don ' t converse with their family when they are watching television together . 	0
It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don ' t require any participation . 	0
In conclusion , I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group , family or friends or whatever , to sit in front of television and just stare forward . 	1
It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close . 	1
Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ’ s behaviors . 	1
In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers . 	0
It ’ s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life . 	0
In such circumstances , even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems . 	0
To sum up , even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world , it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive . 	1
Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients . 	1
We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made . 	0
Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times , but with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work . 	0
Secondly , other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality . 	0
Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic . 	1
A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars . 	0
This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . 	0
Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . 	0
They do not undergo any pain or misery . 	0
Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? 	0
As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . 	0
Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . 	0
Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	0
To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society . 	1
The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty . 	1
For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	0
To conclude , I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers . 	1
Also , being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals . 	0
In order to protect animals , from my perspective , zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals . 	1
What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better . 	0
When children pay a visit to the zoos , they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals , which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals . 	0
Further , children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers . 	0
On the other hand , complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard . 	1
It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage . 	0
I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . 	1
For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	0
The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . 	0
Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . 	1
Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . 	0
Therefore , if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own . 	1
Moreover , the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people . 	1
Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . 	0
Some people prefer to work for a large company 	0
I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons . 	1
Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . 	0
Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . 	0
First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . 	1
In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	0
For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . 	0
In this view , arts serve cultural and economic purposes . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure . 	1
Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts . 	0
This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage , which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry . 	0
Without arts , people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems . 	0
From the point of the local community , funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development . 	1
Currently , people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition . 	0
Consequently , they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure . 	0
At the same time , the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous . 	1
Thus , only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness . 	0
Generally , personally speaking , I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government . 	1
And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this , because only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted . 	0
Otherwise , another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation . 	1
Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor . 	0
Except these , hundreds of problems would occur during the construction . 	0
