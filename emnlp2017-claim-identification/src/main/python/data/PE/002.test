These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology . 	0
Traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever 	0
Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated . 	0
It is evident that technology promotes economy . 	0
First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture . 	1
I totally disagree this opinion . 	0
Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence . 	0
They make differences between countries . 	0
For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries . 	0
Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions . 	0
The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists . 	0
For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . 	0
In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry . 	1
In addition , sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation . 	0
Funding artists 	0
Nowadays , in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country , every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely . 	0
Therefore , there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists , but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space . 	0
In my view , I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons . 	0
Therefore , culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art . 	1
Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country ' s history and culture by observing various work crafts . 	0
Otherwise , the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday . 	0
The biggest risk is not taking any risk 	0
" The biggest risk is not taking any risk . " 	0
The ones who have a big dream , they need to be brave and dare to live new situations . 	0
It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks , but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong . 	0
Therefore , it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out . 	1
Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . 	1
In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . 	0
In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country . 	0
In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . 	0
Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . 	0
Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . 	0
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field 	0
In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . 	0
For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . 	1
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . 	0
Thus , in my point of view , although it will take some time on it , high school students should take a course on basic economics . 	1
Let me explain it in detail . 	0
That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . 	0
Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	0
Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	1
There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . 	0
Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . 	0
Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . 	0
With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency . 	0
Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning . 	0
In addition , being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life . 	1
Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently . 	0
By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching . 	0
This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic . 	0
Secondly , some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook . 	1
He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends , clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others . 	0
They have whole life to do job and prove themselves , but the childhood phase will never return in their life . 	0
Moreover , they drop out their studies so as to earn more money . 	0
In addition to this , the main drawback of teenagers job is that , they miss out the fun of their childhood time . 	0
They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money . 	0
This would affect their studies , they loose their interest from studies . 	0
Another reason , jobs can divert students from their studies . 	1
If students started earning in earlier age in their life , then they get attracted towards money . 	0
They won ' t be able to get proper time for relaxation , sleep . 	0
Thus , would affect their mental and physical health . 	1
In short , I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world , creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in . 	1
It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . 	0
Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . 	0
According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . 	0
Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . 	1
One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . 	0
He heard lots of " no " , furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams . 	0
It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . 	1
To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . 	0
To conclude , in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations . 	1
Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to , it is necessary to have courage to take risks , be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life . 	1
In conclusion , students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes . 	1
Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	0
I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . 	0
However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . 	0
Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? 	0
Why wasting time going to classes ? 	0
Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . 	1
Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	0
In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . 	1
Many professors grade their students with class attendances . 	0
After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan , the stress was gone . 	0
So , I was quite aggressive , however . 	0
In addition , Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses . 	1
Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects . 	0
Also , there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea . 	0
We can study subjects through EBS lecture . 	0
As an example , I got too much stress from the school . 	0
When they are watching sports programs , it ' s easy to relieve those stresses . 	0
Many children have a lot of stresses recently , since they have so much pressure about study . 	0
There are many Tv programs such as sports programs . 	0
The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
How to learn children more efficiently 	0
Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . 	0
For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . 	0
Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . 	1
Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality . 	1
Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . 	0
At school or university , success depends on how we study . 	0
Everyone has their method to success in life . 	0
Some students prefer to study alone 	0
In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	0
Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . 	0
Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy . 	0
For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand . 	0
Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history . 	1
The last thing is about education . 	0
Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability . 	0
In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology . 	1
Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method . 	0
In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more . 	0
After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life . 	0
Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations . 	0
We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present . 	1
What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media . 	1
Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen , changes have to be done . 	0
This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted . 	1
If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public . 	0
It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized . 	1
To conclude , I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with . 	1
However , I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well . 	0
Thus , exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision . 	0
As all of us know , juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law . 	0
Not only that , the convicted will also receive a fair action . 	1
By doing so , the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences . 	0
Therefore , female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men . 	1
Automatically , the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people . 	1
I strongly agree about this statement . 	0
The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently . 	0
Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held . 	0
Nowadays , there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course . 	1
The gender issue for getting education needs 	0
The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources . 	0
However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole . 	0
In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . 	0
At this point , newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive . 	1
This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today . 	0
Last , but not least , when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down . 	0
For this reason , the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time . 	1
The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so . 	0
The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? 	0
It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries . 	0
On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . 	0
They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . 	0
That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	0
Considering all those factors above , I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary . 	1
In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work . 	0
I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them . 	0
In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . 	0
Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	0
These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	0
Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . 	1
Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . 	0
For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . 	0
Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . 	0
In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . 	0
Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . 	0
Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . 	0
The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
Apart from that , a fair trial can be achieved . 	0
Then , punishment can be given in accordance to the condition . 	0
It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal ' s past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws . 	0
Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
I , for one , agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below . 	0
There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion . 	1
This is because , knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment . 	0
First and foremost , I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal . 	1
The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person . 	0
For instance , take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty . 	0
Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does 	0
With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . 	0
They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . 	0
While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us . 	1
However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . 	1
First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	0
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary . 	0
Naturally , children will be growing up and looking for their job . 	0
For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives . 	0
By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man , we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language . 	1
These are important foundation of modern civilization . 	0
Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems . 	0
Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally-friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change . 	0
Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values . 	0
Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle . 	0
Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance . 	0
As far as I am concerned , the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to . 	1
Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit . 	1
Do you agree that the traditional skills will die out ? 	0
With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology . 	0
Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue . 	0
It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school . 	1
When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported . 	0
However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well . 	1
On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government . 	0
It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society . 	0
Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences . 	0
This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable . 	1
Should government control media crime 	0
The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media . 	1
It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy . 	0
In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure . 	0
Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . 	0
Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	0
Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . 	0
First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . 	1
In my opinion , I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is . 	1
These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . 	0
Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . 	0
In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . 	0
University students should attend classes or not ? 	0
Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . 	0
Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . 	0
I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers , but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human ' s touch . 	0
Secondly , children need human interactions . 	1
However , I do not agree that this explosion in technology will ' innovate ' the education system , by replacing teachers with computers . 	1
There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers . 	0
There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms 	0
In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process . 	0
For example , lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector . 	0
However , scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching . 	0
Firstly , computers need to be operated by people . 	1
No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today . 	0
On the other hand , studying hard will give children a better future . 	1
Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future . 	0
Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children , otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time . 	0
In my point of view , both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children . 	1
Children should studying hard or playing sport ? 	0
Both can improve their future 	0
Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
Hence , this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature . 	0
To sum up , art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere , so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work . 	1
Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted . 	1
Indeed , not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts . 	0
Furthermore , they are most likely to quarrel every day , instead of to help each other . 	0
Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
Use of CCTV cameras 	0
It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . 	0
Although higher education does not guarantee young students ' success , the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges . 	1
More importantly , many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society . 	0
Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships . 	0
The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results . 	0
As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
In conclusion , the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone ' s career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender . 	1
Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person ' s career . 	0
These days , it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities . 	0
So , learning from human ' s history , education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college . 	0
According to this opinion , giving equal education for both men and women is a must . 	1
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons . 	0
Protect animals or not ? 	0
In my opinion , we should give priority to our own issues . 	1
While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention . 	0
If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat . 	0
Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem . 	0
However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution . 	1
Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible . 	1
A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment . 	0
The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being . 	0
Do arts and music improve the quality of life ? 	0
My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs . 	1
Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is . 	1
In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens . 	0
This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well-rounded social system . 	0
Admittedly , art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives , for example , it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work . 	1
However , it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room . 	0
By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all . 	0
To conclude , art could play an active role in improving the quality of people ' s lives , but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life . 	1
Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . 	0
Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . 	0
This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . 	0
In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . 	0
Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program . 	1
Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . 	1
Schools should only teach children the academic subject 	0
People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . 	0
This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . 	0
Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . 	0
Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . 	0
In addition , Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World . 	0
They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes . 	0
Moreover , It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World . 	0
Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child ' s vision . 	0
Therefore , they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance . 	1
Overall , it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate , understanding other studies , etc , to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education . 	1
Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . 	0
So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . 	0
In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	1
It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . 	0
Having job would affect their health , divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life . 	1
Thus , for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies . 	1
Therefore , they should take advantage of life as much possible they can . 	1
But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult , when they are away from home . 	1
They will have to pay a lot of bills , because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant , who they may not like . 	0
Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly 	0
Many young adults want to get away from their parent ' s houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits , to be independent . 	0
If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working , because they will not have money to pay for everything . 	0
There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home , because parents will take care for them . 	0
Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money . 	1
If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan , electricity , water or even for a meal . 	0
Moreover , parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying . 	0
Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant , who they do not like . 	1
As the world ' s situation is always changing , act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges . 	1
No matter how advanced technology will be , it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils . 	0
As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the ' Teachers Global Group ' - reveals , human interactions will never be imitated by computers : ' This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education . 	0
Without someone who can explain and understand their problems , pupils cannot actually learn ' . 	0
I am inclined to agree with this scientific view , because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils , be a friend and a model . 	0
In conclusion , there can be no school without a teacher . 	1
I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process , but they will never take their place . 	1
Teachers are not just teachers , they are also friends and conseilieurs . 	1
Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . 	0
For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	0
In my opinion , I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world . 	1
First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . 	1
Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . 	0
However , some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information . 	1
The internet provides a lot of valuable information 	0
In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . 	0
In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . 	1
Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . 	0
There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards . 	1
These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time . 	0
To conclude , it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students . 	1
However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims . 	0
By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves . 	1
And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . 	0
Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . 	0
Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . 	0
When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . 	0
However , it is not sufficient in itself . 	0
The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising . 	1
Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers . 	0
Advertisements affects on consumer goods 	0
Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . 	1
We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . 	0
In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons . 	1
The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers . 	0
In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements . 	1
They make the product preferable . 	1
Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . 	1
Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . 	0
As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	0
The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . 	0
Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . 	0
However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . 	0
When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . 	0
Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . 	0
For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
In conclusion , more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction . 	1
Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars . 	0
On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it . 	0
We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species . 	1
When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help . 	0
Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
It will be good for children , because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team . 	0
That will make children getting lots of friends , so they can contribute positively to community . 	0
Secondly , playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children ' s well-being . 	0
In conclusion , both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children ' s future . 	1
At the same time , playing sports will give good effects on children . 	1
There are many popular sports among children such as football , basketball , and volleyball . 	0
Also , there are many benefit when children doing sport . 	0
Firstly , children who always playing sport like football , they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player . 	0
The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student . 	0
It ' s an essential learning process . 	1
Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . 	0
Now that , it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children . 	0
For these reasons , I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children . 	1
Instead , this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school , since it helped me to relieve my stress . 	0
In conclusion , of course , the television can have violent programs , however , if children can use Tv programs wisely , there are more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . 	0
Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	0
To conclude , people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying , doing business and exploring the world . 	1
With valuable information it provides , people can enjoy their lives much more . 	1
Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . 	0
For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	0
Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . 	1
This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . 	0
Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . 	1
People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . 	0
If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . 	0
In addition , job can provide money to us . 	1
Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . 	0
Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . 	0
However , to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills . 	1
An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . 	0
Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . 	0
This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . 	0
The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes . 	0
Should students be required to attend classes ? 	0
So an optional attendance saves time and money . 	0
In conclusion , technology has brought many benefits , but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever . 	1
For instance , children who always studying hard and getting high achievement , it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company . 	0
In conclusion , it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers . 	1
Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	1
From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities , both are crucial on the way to a brighter future . 	1
Furthermore , jobs has various responsibilities like attendance , sometimes extra work and so on . 	0
This would result in stress , tension and tiredness . 	0
It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life . 	1
A student has to do lots of studies in today ' s competitive world to prove himself . 	0
He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades . 	0
If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time , then it would cause an extra burden on them . 	1
Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling ? 	0
In my opinion , it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students . 	1
Although , many argue that it provide good working experience , but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways . 	1
Having jobs would affect the health of the student . 	1
Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes . 	1
In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions . 	0
Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them . 	1
All in all , protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently , but also contributes to the next generation . 	1
The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine . 	1
These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world . 	0
To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons . 	0
From their point of view , the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation , such as mechanics , sales persons , or engineers , and , furthermore , labors for graduates are in short supply . 	0
What is worse , the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying . 	0
In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time-consuming . 	1
Young people should go to university or not 	0
Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university . 	0
In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . 	0
In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision . 	0
If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0
Thus , people have a good quality life . 	0
Therefore , criminal rate were drop . 	0
When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . 	0
So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . 	0
These impact on every living creature in the world . 	0
Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . 	0
Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . 	0
For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . 	0
Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . 	1
Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	0
In conclusion , although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children , it seem to me that the effects of learning music , sports are profound . 	1
Giving mobile phones to the unemployed 	0
Today , the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many . 	0
Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . 	0
They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money . 	0
Nevertheless , I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money . 	1
In a positive point of view , when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet , they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities . 	0
For example , they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them . 	0
With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job . 	0
Not only that , the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with . 	0
In short , if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive . 	1
On top of that , till now , there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment . 	1
To put it in a nutshell , the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment . 	1
To illustrate this further , the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living . 	0
To conclude , the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed . 	1
Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money . 	0
This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country . 	0
Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones . 	0
In this context , the public ' s money is spent worthlessly . 	0
Furthermore , when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity . 	1
It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless . 	0
I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	0
Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . 	0
Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture . 	1
Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism . 	1
For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . 	0
More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . 	0
A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . 	0
Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . 	0
Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	0
Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . 	1
It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . 	0
A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money 	0
Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income . 	1
Each individual visualize success differently . 	0
Those activities have proven that women can also do the men ' s works . 	0
We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers , and dealing with machines . 	0
In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . 	1
Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group . 	0
In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality . 	1
To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . 	0
Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	0
Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . 	0
For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . 	0
Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . 	1
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1

His habits may be totally different from theirs , his behavior may be inappropriate , but they will have to live with him or even share a room , in order to have less expenses . 	0

They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate . 	1
As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages . 	0
Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime . 	0
First of all , to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers . 	0
Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons . 	0
Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence . 	1
As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . 	0
The internet has been more and more popular for recent years , providing people with a huge source of information . 	0
Will newspapers become a thing of the past ? 	0
Another point is that , from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one . 	0
Hence , the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information . 	1

" Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long-lasting prosperity . 	0
As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both . 	1
So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0

First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	1
On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . 	0
Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself . 	0
In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . 	1

In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
It is targeted for children to teenager . 	0
For example , in Korea , there ' s program called EBS . 	0
However , I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects . 	1
Many people say that television has negative effects on children , since it can be violent or inappropriate for children . 	0
Nowadays , we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv . 	0

Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . 	1
Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . 	0
In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . 	0
And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . 	0
Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . 	0
Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . 	0
In my opinion , governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating . 	1
First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . 	1
Improve roads or public transports 	0
Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation . 	0
For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . 	0
On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . 	1
I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates . 	1
International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding 	0
Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . 	0
There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . 	1
Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . 	0
Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . 	0
Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	0
