So , communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places . 	0
Due to globalization , many people are traveling for professional trips . 	0
As a consequence , various local languages are becoming extinct . 	0
Its usage is increasing day by day . 	0
Today , English is commonly used language across the world . 	0
Various local languages are becoming extinct 	0
A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way . 	1
In my opinion , I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live . 	1
While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages . 	0
Some people argue that , this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate . 	0
In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
In conclusion , there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid ; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people , keeping strong global economy . 	1
When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt . 	0
In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others . 	0
Third , the campaigns might include practical benefits . 	1
It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization . 	0
If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted . 	0
Secondly , aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people . 	1
Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties . 	0
I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers , and it will make the earth a better place to live . 	1
Moreover , another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings . 	0
From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . 	1
However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . 	0
Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . 	0
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives 	0
Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . 	0
Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . 	0
Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . 	0
In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties . 	1
In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . 	0
For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . 	0
Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums . 	0
I will discuss my view in two main areas . 	0
Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity . 	0
Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city . 	1
Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint . 	0
Also , they can save value things in their life such as time and money , and enjoy they life with the best way . 	0
Moreover , I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers , because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money . 	1
To sum up , I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures . 	1
This will yield positive results on not only the people ' s physical and mental development but also their finance . 	1
Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds . 	1
Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture . 	0
Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle . 	0
There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists . 	0
Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees . 	1
Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful . 	0
It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities . 	0
In addition , the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam . 	0
Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth . 	1
Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . 	0
In conclusion , I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around . 	1
There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion . 	0
In order to tackle the problem , governments have to turn people ' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes . 	1
The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads . 	0
They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere . 	1
Nevertheless , public transportation systems even have more important advantages . 	1
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . 	1
To sum up , I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees . 	1
Alternatively , providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses . 	1
Things have changed a lot . 	0
I grow up in a better condition than my father did . 	0
In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage . 	0
For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help . 	0
What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects . 	1
For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors . 	0
Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help . 	0
They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot . 	0
He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot . 	0
Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction . 	0
A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . 	0
We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . 	0
Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . 	0
Co-operation is essential for teamwork . 	1
However , co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle . 	0
Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . 	0
The modern society is full of cut-throat competition . 	0
Competition or co-operation-which is better 	0
It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . 	0
For instance , lions hunt in a team . 	0
On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	0
I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . 	0
This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	0
What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . 	1
A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . 	0
I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	0
Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . 	1
There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . 	0
Considering all the benefits , I would choose to live in a big city . 	1
In conclusion , while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air , big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places . 	1
They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way . 	0
The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge . 	1
The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge , not a worker with outstanding communicating skill . 	0
In a word , the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer . 	1
The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions . 	0
Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be . 	0
Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home . 	0
Therefore , he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents . 	0
Thus , I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile . 	1
Furthermore , living at home costs less than living outside . 	0
Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . 	1
A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	0
So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . 	1
Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	0
To sum up , it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country . 	1
It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same . 	1
My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field , which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work , on the economy and on the employment . 	1
Nevertheless , supporters would argue that zoos , which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals , would provide better care for the animals inside . 	1
It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives . 	1
To begin with , it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings . 	0
From my perspective , animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos . 	1
Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate , with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals , while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos . 	0
Zoos should be built to protect rural animals 	0
As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . 	0
Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . 	0
Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . 	0
Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . 	1
Needless to say , such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune , not to cure , but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years . 	0
Similarly , if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product , obesity , myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance . 	0
No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes , especially at primary level , in the hope of raising people ' s awareness . 	1
Children should be taught about balanced diets , nutritious food as well as harmful ones , thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle . 	0
What is more , it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of , for instance , not consuming too much fast food , over-fried food or intoxicants . 	0
In addition , it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases . 	1
Prevention is better than cure 	0
There has always been a saying in medicine : " Prevention is better than cure " . 	0
This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures . 	0
In my opinion , this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly . 	1
The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area . 	0
In conclusion , I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games . 	1
It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar . 	0
But we have to realize the fact : majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games . 	0
In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings . 	0
The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings . 	0
The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity 	0
As far as I am concerned , we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them . 	1
For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China . 	0
By seeing historic buildings - - whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area . 	0
To sum up , living with parents longer brings about memories with parents , less cost , and advice from parents . 	1
Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page . 	1
Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household . 	1
Personally , I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly . 	1
Why and why not ? 	0
Do married women usually work ? 	0
This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present . 	0
By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life . 	0
Firstly , extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses . 	0
I will mention some basic reasons as following . 	0
Secondly , working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity . 	0
So , it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money . 	1
Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? 	0
In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . 	0
To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . 	0
From my point of view , children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons . 	1
Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . 	1
Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . 	0
It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . 	0
Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . 	0
Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . 	1
In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . 	0
If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . 	0
Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	1
Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes 	0
There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . 	0
From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people . 	1
It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . 	0
A single international language or not ? 	0
The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . 	0
Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	1
Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . 	1
As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . 	0
In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . 	0
To illustrate this further , the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn . 	0
Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country . 	0
Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . 	0
Thus , human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely . 	1
To cite an example , Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace . 	0
They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country . 	0
Nonetheless , I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts . 	0
In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society . 	1
Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations . 	0
To conclude , it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists ' work . 	1
Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . 	0
Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade 	0
Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . 	0
Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries . 	1
On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . 	0
High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . 	0
Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . 	0
To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	1
In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . 	1
Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . 	0
Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde 	0
It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown , so they do not need any help for making important decisions . 	0
However , in my opinion , teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages . 	1
It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses , trains , and subways investment . 	1
Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy . 	0
Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern . 	0
Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways 	0
The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . 	0
First and foremost , carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere . 	0
Both these two things are important . 	0
Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air . 	1
In the first place , there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children , therefore they are the best advisor for their children . 	1
This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . 	1
If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . 	0
They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life , so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things . 	0
These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . 	0
I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition . 	1
A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	0
Thus , competition and co-operation go hand in hand . 	0
' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . 	0
Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . 	1
This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	0
However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . 	0
They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . 	0
When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier . 	0
Computers have opened up a network connection among people . 	0
Computers have an important role in social and personal life . 	1
A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	1
Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . 	0
By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . 	1
Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . 	0
Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . 	0
This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . 	0
People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	0
The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . 	0
Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . 	1
They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	0
Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	0
Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . 	0
Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . 	0
New high school 	0
The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education . 	1
The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community . 	1
Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . 	1
I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community . 	1
Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . 	0
Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . 	0
The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	0
As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . 	0
Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland . 	1
In conclusion , richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade . 	1
Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . 	1
Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	1
For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . 	0
Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . 	0
In conclusion , I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are , likely , more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
For instance , many good medicines cost vast amounts of money , which cannot be afforded by poorer families . 	0
Finally , wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines , which will be very beneficial for the health of a child . 	1
This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future . 	1
In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness . 	1
As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events . 	1
This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . 	0
South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . 	0
For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . 	0
Thus , I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions . 	1
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work . 	1
The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product , how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms . 	0
For example , the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country . 	0
The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products . 	0
The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part . 	0
For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business , but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction , and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that . 	0
Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field . 	1
Obviously , showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money . 	0
Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs . 	1
If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . 	0
For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	0
Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . 	0
For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	0
The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . 	0
It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . 	0
To conclude , no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing , handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people , especially students at the early age . 	1
At this circumstances , they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where . 	0
As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs . 	0
Nevertheless , this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability . 	0
Thus , it is not need for young people to possess this ability . 	1
Finally , some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job . 	0
Every employee can not afford this kind of loss . 	0
In this case , those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired . 	0
For instance , the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule . 	0
However , things have been changing all the time . 	0
If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent . 	0
In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city . 	0
Small town vs . Big city ( opportunities , entertainment , job places ) 	0
Big city life provides many opportunities . 	0
As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places , I think I would prefer to live in a city . 	1
Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . 	0
First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . 	0
At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . 	1
Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	1
Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . 	0
There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . 	0
If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances , I will definitely say NO . 	0
Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum . 	0
And I believe my friend will do the same to me . 	0
This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	0
Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . 	1
Internet facilities such as msn , skype made visual communication possible . 	0
For example , via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends , but also make interviews for employment , enrolment into universities . 	0
With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes . 	0
In addition , it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office , but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends , family members in any part of the world . 	0
In result , communication has become cheaper , faster and visual . 	1
Finally , I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick , a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways . 	1
In actual , republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s . 	0
Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business . 	1
To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies . 	0
First of all , poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer . 	0
However , I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects , overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons . 	1
In addition , a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries . 	1
It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries . 	1
That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries . 	0
In this world , there is no one who does not know this world ' globalization ' , which means the world are more closer , and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways . 	0
Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect 	0
I believe that experiencing the real life by myself , I could learn more than just obey the advice . 	1
Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves , why don ' t the younger try to do the same ? 	0
For one thing , there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don ' t experience it by yourself . 	0
For example , a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous . 	0
If you did as he told , you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely . 	0
In addition , family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time . 	0
You will grow to be dependent and reliant . 	0
In contrast , free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose . 	0
According to myself , both ways are good , but I prefer the latter . 	0
It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable . 	0
For instance , paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution . 	0
On the other hand , the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated . 	0
Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism . 	1
In fact , compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers . 	0
In conclusion , it is evident that under suitable administration , the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so . 	0
After careful consideration of both sides of the argument , the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages . 	1
Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports ? 	0
University students can be divided into two groups , one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students . 	0
Usually the second group ' s members do not have enough time to do exercise . 	0
We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life . 	0
But I don ' t think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities . 	1
First , in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football / basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports . 	1
For example , my roommate , Mary , always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory . 	0
When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day . 	0
As you see , she is doing exercise without spending a cent . 	0
What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus , inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health . 	0
The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money . 	0
In the second place , the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well . 	1
This is to say , the " weaker " gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields . 	0
Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on . 	1
Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children . 	0
To start with , the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society . 	0
This , contrary to some ideas , is a positive progress in human society from my point of view . 	1
Women have been opened up to more chances than ever . 	0
The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life , including the revolution of feminism . 	0
Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past 	0
Finally , quality takes time . 	0
If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . 	0
Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . 	0
If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . 	0
By listening to your family and friends advice , you can definitely avoid many unexpected things . 	0
On the other hand , finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature . 	1
Therefore , learning about life , which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed . 	0
Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience . 	0
The best way of learning life 	0
Life is full of challenges , difficulties and unexpected obstacles . 	0
Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life . 	0
And friends , people who are the same generation with you , they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you , which is not . 	0
Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages . 	0
On one hand , the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter . 	1
All things considered , in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles . 	1
Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges . 	0
Also , children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work . 	0
Admittedly , such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or , under many circumstances , women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives . 	1
What is more , women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration . 	0
Because of the similarity I talked before , acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends . 	0
Second , close friends can easily understand each others feelings . 	1
Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time . 	0
Moreover , they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings . 	0
When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible . 	0
Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend . 	0
If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business . 	0
To me , friends are the most important people in my life second to my family . 	1
In conclusion , a friend is a person you care about . 	1
However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace . 	0
The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves . 	0
However , the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street . 	0
Overall , I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity . 	1
They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily . 	0
To sum up , it makes no difference , people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision , nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice . 	1
This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else . 	0
Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control . 	0
Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term . 	0
First of all , great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive . 	1
Meanwhile , eliminating meaningless actions . 	0
Therefore , it is essential for people , especially young ones , to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions . 	1
With the fast rolling wheels of modern society , life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past . 	0
It is essential to have ability to plan and organize 	0
As we all know , the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly . 	0
Equally important , the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time . 	1
To sum up , this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying . 	1
The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	0
So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment . 	1
The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate , but I think that it isn ' t a big deal . 	1
For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . 	0
After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . 	0
The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . 	0
This will increase the social connections of the students . 	0
Because their major in completely involved in physical activities . 	0
In contrast , for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories , because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field . 	0
In addition , students choose their major based on their interests . 	0
The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students . 	1
For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other , we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people . 	0
In conclusion , I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students , but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories . 	1
Finally , spending money on social activities looks like wasting money . 	1
For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people , university programs are the last place they would choose . 	0
By way of conclusion , it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression . 	1
It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide . 	0
However , I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat . 	0
They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting . 	0
That ’ s why it is important to take risks . 	1
In sum , I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them . 	1
The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . 	0
If you don ’ t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . 	0
If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . 	0
If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . 	0
As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . 	0
All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	0
Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . 	0
Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? 	0
A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . 	0
In my opinion , a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following . 	1
And then he or she can do better in teaching works . 	0
He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . 	1
He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . 	0
For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . 	0
If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together . 	0
All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by . 	0
I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends , and I am fully content that I have such nice friends . 	0
The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age . 	0
When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown . 	0
I believe that with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily . 	1
In a word , our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life . 	1
What they want is help their child to make a progress . 	0
Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can . 	0
My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents . 	0
First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents . 	0
Learning to be independent is essential for young adults 	0
Learning to be independent is essential for young adults . 	0
However , how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue . 	0
In my point of view , staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult . 	1
Last but not least , nowadays , there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work . 	1
Therefore , it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better . 	1
These women will set a good example for their children . 	0
These things in turn will make them more confident , independent . 	0
In conclusion , a well-organized home does not need the housewife ' s presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home . 	1
Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women . 	0
First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university . 	0
Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career . 	1
The opportunity to receive education from university 	0
There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success . 	0
However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate . 	0
Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success . 	0
It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family . 	1
I agree with this statement . 	0
In my opinion , family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success . 	1
There are a couple of reasons . 	0
In this sense , people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms . 	0
For example , most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people , because the person with better education has a wider outlook , which will allow no brainwash . 	0
As a result , they can be proselytized into bad isms . 	0
Moreover , these people will not have an access to a good education . 	0
To begin with , children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as : crime , thievery and thuggery . 	1
However , I completely disagree with this position . 	0
According to some people , child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones . 	0
Children from poorer families are more successful in the future life . 	0
Secondly , children from rich families have better skills on how to use money , because they use it a lot of times . 	1
Nevertheless , people who are born in well-off families have access to good education , which will have a positive impact on their later life . 	1
Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries . 	0
Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . 	1
Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia . 	0
Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only . 	1
For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record . 	0
We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality . 	0
Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder . 	0
Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions . 	0
In conclusion , I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict . 	1
It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well . 	0
When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand . 	0
That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities . 	0
Therefore , government should spend money on preservation of old buildings . 	1
There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it ' s gone . 	0
This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication . 	1
On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage . 	1
I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other . 	0
First , it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone . 	0
Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances . 	0
After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways . 	0
There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance . 	0
One or two close friends vs . a large number of casual acquaintances 	0
We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant . 	0
However , I still agree that it ' s better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances . 	1
So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends . 	1
We spend time together but we could never be friend . 	0
If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances . 	1
Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile . 	0
For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want . 	0
In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this . 	0
A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places . 	1
Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder 	0
The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries . 	0
Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce . 	0
By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured . 	0
We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place . 	0
To conclude , I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one . 	1
On the other hand , few people are worried about the dying local languages . 	1
Adding to that , exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics , medical , astronomy etc would become easier . 	0
Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people . 	0
Furthermore , students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages ; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment . 	0
Further , these languages are tightly coupled with history ; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost . 	0
As the usage of these languages decrease , culture also changes accordingly . 	0
They represent local culture . 	0
These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures . 	0
Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities . 	0
Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . 	0
Under suitable administration , tourism enhances local economic development 	0
Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy . 	0
Nevertheless , some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction , as a result of tourist activities , and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems . 	0
While both positions seem reasonable , my view is that , through proper management and regulation , a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas . 	1
The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region . 	1
This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well-regulated tourism programs . 	0
Furthermore , tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes . 	0
As a result , this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return . 	0
For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . 	0
Competition helps in improvement and evolution . 	1
Competition has helped the development of science and technology . 	0
An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . 	0
Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . 	0
However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	0
A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . 	0
It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . 	0
Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . 	1
In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	0
The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life . 	0
Secondly , these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign . 	1
As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities . 	0
For instance , I would take my boss ' s example ; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years . 	0
Recently , his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries . 	0
He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him . 	0
To conclude this , I would strongly emphasis and recommend , Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies . 	1
This will help in uplift of society , and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person . 	1
Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . 	0
That is good for both of the professor and students . 	0
Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . 	1
They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . 	0
If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . 	1
But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . 	0
He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . 	0
In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . 	1
Hence , even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects , I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus , I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them . 	1
Hence , staying longer with parents is a better choice . 	1
Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
Admittedly , there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career . 	1
However , those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths . 	0
Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children , majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students . 	0
Second , children could learn nothing from these computer games , therefore time on this activity is really time wasting . 	1
Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability . 	0
An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week , while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days . 	0
First and foremost , a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined . 	1
I hold a positive view against this opinion . 	0
It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time . 	1
Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed ! 	0
Secondly , the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve . 	1
Especially , if they have no knowledge or education in this field . 	0
If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research , I would opt for the second one . 	1
These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture . 	0
Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries . 	0
A university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country 	0
This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land . 	1
The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land . 	1
Most of these lands are left without any treatment . 	0
First of all , my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture . 	0
In conclusion , a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university . 	1
And it ' s worth to spend more time on it than on teaching . 	0
In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things . 	1
Hence , with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information , and can get it from different sources . 	0
Second , in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster , visual and cheaper . 	0
Computers have made life easier 	0
The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology . 	0
While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful , others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient . 	0
In my point of view , computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication . 	1
First , computers through internet made our access to information easier . 	1
Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly , store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed . 	0
Search engines such as google , yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes . 	0
Social networks such as facebook , twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments . 	0
That ' s why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge . 	0
To sum up , I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment , the excellent knowledge will be of more importance . 	1
After we get a job , the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture , but in making us excellent and totally master this job . 	0
Finally , we will be rewarded with pride . 	0
Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge . 	1
Through our whole study life , undergraduate and graduate , we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job , just like an old Chinese scholar said , the essence of study is utilizing it . 	0
The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company . 	0
So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge . 	0
Because it can not only benefit our employers , but also ourselves will be rewarded . 	1
Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . 	0
Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace . 	1
This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . 	0
For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . 	0
Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . 	0
This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols . 	0
It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation . 	1
This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . 	0
For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . 	0
Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings 	0
Hence , taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily . 	1
If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain . 	0
People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society . 	1
For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . 	0
On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . 	0
Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	0
Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes . 	1
That ' s why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant . 	1
Admittedly , the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job . 	1
This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates , cooperating with other workers needs this ability , too . 	0
But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating , that is , the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker , but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave . 	0
Excellent knowledge is better than ability to adopt oneself 	0
With the rapid development of economy , the controversial of good worker ' s requirement is always in a limelight . 	0
A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary , because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker . 	0
From my perspective , there is only one thing would be beneficial to company , and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker , that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job . 	1
By working too long , they often become tired , lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick . 	0
Moreover , they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons . 	0
There is a saying in my native village , " Health is Wealth " . 	0
I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health . 	0
Working Extended hours should restricted 	0
Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days . 	0
In my opinion , a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours . 	1
First of all , many of us would agree to the fact that people ; who prefer working longer hours , do not find time to focus on their health . 	1
The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion . 	0
However , people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life . 	1
For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . 	0
After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	0
In my opinion , it is very important to live life at a slower pace , because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages . 	1
First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . 	1
If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . 	0
Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . 	0
Rush vs Slower Pace 	0
Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . 	0
However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . 	0
To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . 	0
For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	0
In summary , students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education . 	1
Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	1
For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . 	0
In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . 	0
Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . 	0
General education plays a significant role in specialized education . 	0
This might result in limited choices in the future . 	0
They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . 	0
Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . 	0
Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	1
Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . 	0
For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	0
I think , however , students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics . 	1
They believe this motivates students to study . 	0
Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . 	0
High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum 	0
They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . 	0
To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . 	1
In addition , it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles . 	1
I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university . 	1
In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . 	0
Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . 	0
It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies . 	0
First and foremost , if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run . 	0
In short , without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists . 	1
For example , paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times . 	0
Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do . 	0
Artists ' freedom to express ideas 	0
I however , agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece . 	1
Nevertheless , some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions . 	0
Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries . 	0
Furthermore , it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation . 	0
As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . 	1
To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	0
When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . 	0
Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . 	0
For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	0
In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . 	1
In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . 	0
To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . 	1
This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . 	0
Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
Gun control 	0
For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
In this complex society , we , young people , are encompassed with multiple tasks , so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with . 	1
It is obviously a huge waste of time . 	0
But if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination . 	0
The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks . 	1
There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . 	0
For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . 	0
By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . 	0
Successful people try new things and take risks 	0
I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . 	0
There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . 	0
These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ’ t be always found in books . 	1
I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . 	0
Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? 	0
Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . 	0
Also , I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country . 	1
The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs . 	0
First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . 	1
In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . 	0
But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . 	1
But to me , learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate . 	1
In summary , each way learning life has its own benefits . 	0
In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier . 	0
By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . 	1
For example , in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc . Second , colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum . 	0
Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university . 	0
