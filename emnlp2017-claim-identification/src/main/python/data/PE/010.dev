It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . 	0
There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . 	0
By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . 	1
For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	0
Children can effectively learn from watching television 	0
TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . 	0
But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth . 	1
If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study . 	1
But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . 	1
For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . 	0
From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . 	1
However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . 	0
Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . 	0
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives 	0
Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . 	0
Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . 	0
Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . 	0
In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties . 	1
In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . 	0
For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . 	0
He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . 	0
For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . 	0
If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . 	0
They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . 	0
He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . 	0
For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . 	0
Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . 	1
However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	0
Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . 	0
First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . 	1
From this point of view , I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education . 	1
During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . 	0
What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . 	0
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . 	0
Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? 	0
This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . 	0
Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . 	1
I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared . 	1
The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . 	0
It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
Languages ' extinction , discuss both views 	0
Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	1
For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . 	0
Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . 	0
There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . 	1
In conclusion , it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement . 	1
There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves . 	0
Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation . 	0
Hence , it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge . 	0
Thus , it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones . 	1
Admittedly , the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated . 	1
Consequently , they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing . 	0
Besides , the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution . 	0
Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses . 	0
To cite an example , the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him . 	0
In conclusion , although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial , it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages . 	1
Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . 	0
Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . 	0
This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . 	0
Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . 	0
Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	1
Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services 	0
As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . 	0
As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . 	0
However , from my perspective , I think arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well . 	1
On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . 	1
Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . 	0
Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . 	1
The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
How to learn children more efficiently 	0
Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
To sum up , I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees . 	1
Alternatively , providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses . 	1
Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
Gender Equality at university admission 	0
Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	0
In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . 	0
All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those . 	0
In a nutshell , I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible . 	1
Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . 	0
On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . 	1
These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . 	0
As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . 	0
Roles of international sports events 	0
Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . 	1
In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area . 	0
In conclusion , I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games . 	1
It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar , and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar . 	0
But we have to realize the fact : majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying , sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games . 	0
It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . 	0
When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	0
Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . 	0
Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . 	1
Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . 	0
They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . 	1
For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . 	0
Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	0
It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . 	0
Several languages are in danger of extinction 	0
But the others do not believe it is possible . 	0
Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . 	0
First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . 	0
In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue . 	0
The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . 	0
It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . 	0
I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . 	0
The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	0
And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	0
In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . 	1
Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . 	0
First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . 	1
Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . 	0
If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . 	0
There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . 	0
Luck vs hard work 	0
Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target . 	1
However , I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals . 	1
However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . 	0
Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . 	1
Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . 	0
The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . 	0
Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	1
The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . 	0
Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success . 	1
Firstly , education is an essential part in development . 	0
This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters . 	0
For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . 	0
In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	0
In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . 	0
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
There are many different opinions regarding world culture . 	0
Opinions regarding world culture 	0
However , in my view , a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons . 	1
Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . 	0
Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . 	0
Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . 	1
Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . 	1
For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	0
For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . 	0
Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . 	0
I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
Creative Artists 	0
One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people . 	1
It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation . 	0
A single international language or not ? 	0
The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not . 	0
Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose . 	1
Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions . 	1
As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation . 	0
In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them . 	0
They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives . 	0
Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity , while children are always keen on competition and winning . 	1
In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
Studying alone or in a group 	0
It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . 	0
There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . 	0
Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . 	0
For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . 	0
Computers have opened up a network connection among people . 	0
Computers have an important role in social and personal life . 	1
A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	1
Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . 	0
By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . 	1
Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . 	0
Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . 	0
This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . 	0
People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	0
The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . 	0
In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . 	1
Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . 	0
Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	0
Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . 	0
Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	0
On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . 	1
First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . 	1
This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . 	0
That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . 	0
The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . 	0
Keeping animals in zoos 	0
Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . 	0
Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . 	0
Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . 	0
On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	0
To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	1
Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . 	1
For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . 	0
Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . 	0
Most libraries are free not for students also for public . 	0
Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . 	0
But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . 	0
Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . 	0
Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . 	0
When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . 	0
Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	0
However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . 	0
In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . 	0
As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . 	0
Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . 	1
Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . 	1
In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	0
Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies , I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day . 	1
Physical exercise should be required part of every school day 	0
In addition , including exercise in children ' s daily routine , it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age . 	1
Exercise is good not only for having a good health body , but also for the mind . 	1
When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . 	0
It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . 	0
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	0
Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . 	0
Some people think that , adults need playing games as children do . 	0
However , in my opinion , games are no longer too important for them for several reasons . 	1
Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . 	0
Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
Gun control and increasing violence 	0
Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work . 	1
Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . 	0
Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	0
As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . 	0
Financial aid to develop countries 	0
However , it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries . 	1
It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . 	0
From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . 	1
Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles . 	0
For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience . 	0
However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . 	0
Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . 	0
Children engagement in paid work 	0
Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	1
First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . 	0
From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . 	0
Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . 	1
Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . 	0
If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	0
Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career 	0
When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . 	0
So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
Some of them had no own savings . 	0
As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
Saving / Spending money 	0
Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
In conclusion , I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children . 	1
Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . 	0
Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	0
Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . 	1
Finally , quality takes time . 	0
If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . 	0
Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . 	0
If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . 	0
By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . 	1
In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . 	0
First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . 	0
All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . 	1
Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . 	0
In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else . 	1
Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries 	0
Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . 	0
For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	0
Second , usually libraries do not have income . 	0
Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . 	0
In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . 	0
After all , retirement not only marks the end of an individual , but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life . 	0
Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does . 	1
He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . 	0
Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . 	0
At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	0
Although it is good to be lucky , depending on luck for everything is not good . 	1
However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention . 	0
Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	0
In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . 	1
Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . 	0
This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . 	0
Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . 	0
Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . 	0
Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
True function of a university 	0
Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . 	0
All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	0
Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . 	0
Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? 	0
A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . 	0
In my opinion , a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following . 	1
And then he or she can do better in teaching works . 	0
He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . 	1
He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . 	0
For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . 	0
To sum up , I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations . 	1
So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . 	1
For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	0
I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour . 	0
And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation . 	1
Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . 	0
This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . 	0
In conclusion , financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries . 	1
Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	1
For youngsters , maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not . 	0
For example , my younger sister likes fencing , and thanks to her desire to win , she never gives up when facing a difficult situation , or even becoming hurt . 	0
On the other hand , adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately . 	0
In fact , a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues . 	0
Because of that , they no longer play games for any moderate achievements , and gradually lose their interest in such activities . 	0
To sum up , I think adults do need to play games , but their styles are often distinct from children ' s , which are often less competitive and more enjoyable . 	1
Along with the high requirement for family and work , games are just some leisure activities for adults , not something necessary as they are meant to be for children . 	1
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication . 	1
On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage . 	1
If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances . 	1
Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile . 	0
For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want . 	0
In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this . 	0
A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places . 	1
Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder 	0
The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries . 	0
Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce . 	0
By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured . 	0
Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
The following will present my points . 	0
As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path . 	1
In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry . 	1
The importance of games for adults comparing to children 	0
As people grow up , the arguments about the importance of games arise . 	0
But , more often , the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies , and as a result , they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago . 	0
For example , in my country , except for a minor part of professional athletes , the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job . 	0
The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin . 	1
Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life . 	0
Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . 	0
That is good for both of the professor and students . 	0
Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . 	1
They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . 	0
If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . 	1
But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . 	0
He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . 	0
In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . 	1
Admittedly , there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career . 	1
However , those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths . 	0
Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children , majority of the games use war , violence , bloody , or sexual subjects to lure the students . 	0
Second , children could learn nothing from these computer games , therefore time on this activity is really time wasting . 	1
Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games , because of their low control ability . 	0
An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week , while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days . 	0
First and foremost , a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined . 	1
I hold a positive view against this opinion . 	0
It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time . 	1
Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed ! 	0
First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
In conclusion , a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university . 	1
And it ' s worth to spend more time on it than on teaching . 	0
Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . 	1
Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	0
Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . 	0
Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . 	0
It will meliorate not only mental and body health , but also will establish in children a habit of doing it , giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules . 	1
Including physical activity in children ' s school day should be strongly considered . 	1
If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0

I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library . 	1
In spite of the importance of sports activities , libraries are more important . 	1
For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . 	0
More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . 	0
A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . 	0
Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . 	0
Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable . 	0
Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working , dedication and passion . 	1
It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . 	0
A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money 	0
Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income . 	1
Each individual visualize success differently . 	0
In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible . 	1
However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	0
To sum up , new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures . 	1
For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . 	0
In fact , new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world . 	1
Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . 	1
This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	0
In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . 	0
This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . 	0
For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . 	0
After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	0
In my opinion , it is very important to live life at a slower pace , because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages . 	1
First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . 	1
If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . 	0
Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . 	0
Rush vs Slower Pace 	0
Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . 	0
However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . 	0
To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . 	0
For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English . 	0
For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
On top of that , due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace . 	0
Apart from that , not all elderly workers are physically well . 	0
I , for one , strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . 	1
First and foremost , if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates . 	0
As a result , most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for . 	1
To illustrate this further , a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available . 	0
Should people be forced to stop working ? 	0
The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society . 	0
Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . 	0
In my personal point of view , the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old . 	1
To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . 	0
We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . 	0
Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . 	0
Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . 	0
Pets have always been essential in our society . 	0
Our useful friends 	0
Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . 	0
First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . 	1
The issue is controversial but in my opinion , pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons . 	1
However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . 	0
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
Its convenience saves our time . 	1
Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . 	0
Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . 	0
First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . 	1
For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . 	0
Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I think choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career . 	1
As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . 	1
To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	0
When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . 	0
Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . 	0
For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	0
In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . 	1
Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0
However , the hooligans only took a minority of people . 	0
So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0
When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . 	0
Then , many people did not have money . 	0
First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied . 	0
To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation . 	1
This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong . 	0
Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect . 	1
On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . 	0
Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself . 	0
In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . 	1
To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
It can influence us in different aspects of life . 	0
In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way . 	1
In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier . 	0
By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . 	1
In this view , arts serve cultural and economic purposes . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure . 	1
Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts . 	0
This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage , which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry . 	0
Without arts , people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems . 	0
From the point of the local community , funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development . 	1
Currently , people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition . 	0
Consequently , they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure . 	0
At the same time , the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous . 	1
