However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . 	0
They have the life of a person at their discretion . 	0
They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . 	1
The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . 	0
When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . 	0
Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	1
Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . 	0
Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	1
For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . 	0
Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	0
It will help people around the world understand each other more . 	0
Since , international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion . 	0
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	0
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	1
For the time of occasions , people regardless of nationality , origin and religion will live together . 	0
Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	0
Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . 	0
Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . 	0
Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . 	0
For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . 	0
First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . 	0
Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . 	1
Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments . 	0
It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment . 	1
Prevention is better than cure 	0
With the rapid development of the standard of people ' s life , increasing numbers of animal experiments are done , new medicines and foods , for instance . 	0
Using animals for the benefit of the human beings 	0
In my essay , I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects . 	0
Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature , however , I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals . 	1
The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals . 	0
First of all , as we all know , animals are friendly and vital for people , because if there are no animals in the world , the balance of nature will broke down , and we , human , will die out as well . 	0
Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance , it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life . 	0
In other words , doing this various testing is a hazard of human ' s future and next generation . 	1
The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human ' s life . 	0
To begin with , it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious , and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying . 	1
Therefore , instead of interfering children ' s creativity , technology actually encourages children to learn and to create . 	1
Technology has made life too easy for most children . 	0
Obviously , it is waste of time . 	0
They must take only a bus to go to another place . 	0
If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . 	0
For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . 	0
On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . 	0
Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly . 	1
Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . 	0
It is absolutely a major problem . 	0
For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . 	0
He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion . 	0
For example , my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion . 	0
If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . 	0
They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal . 	0
He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery . 	0
For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery . 	0
Thirdly , if you work hard , luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target . 	1
However , up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened . 	0
On the other hand , the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory . 	0
First of all , through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students . 	1
From this point of view , I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education . 	1
During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred . 	0
What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others . 	0
It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy . 	0
Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate ? 	0
People will spend less time on cooking food 	0
However , I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food . 	1
The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . 	0
There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . 	0
Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . 	0
As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . 	0
For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . 	0
Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . 	0
Therefore , I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students . 	1
To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . 	1
Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . 	0
According to my opinion , because it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice . 	1
Going to classes should be optional for the students 	0
University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . 	0
It was waste of the time . 	0
Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . 	1
Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside . 	1
Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth . 	0
However , the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now . 	0
They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away . 	0
Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems . 	0
Second , the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues . 	1
The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator , since the rising sea water could drown them . 	0
Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together . 	0
In conclusion , environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence . 	1
It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages . 	0
Furthermore , it also have potentially harm for human ' s health without any testing . 	0
Thus even if they are volunteers ; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines . 	0
To sum up , I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals ' profits , the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits . 	1
After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication , they also contribute to some social problems . 	1
Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . 	0
Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed . 	1
For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat " , people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . 	0
With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . 	0
It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home . 	1
Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	0
In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency . 	1
It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . 	0
In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . 	0
Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . 	1
For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . 	0
It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . 	0
For another example , if one ’ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office . 	1
First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . 	1
They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . 	0
Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . 	0
Working at home vs Working in a company 	0
Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . 	0
People are no longer restricted in the office . 	0
This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . 	0
Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly 	0
With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . 	0
People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . 	0
Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals . 	0
These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent . 	1
First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . 	1
For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . 	0
On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	0
At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . 	1
People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . 	0
In conclusion , International sporting events will draw the international concern . 	1
Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world . 	0
It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills . 	0
In contrast , some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety . 	0
" Pen and Paper " Examination 	0
Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world . 	0
At virtually every stage of the learning process , exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage . 	0
However , many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered . 	0
There are clearly advantages to exams . 	1
They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates . 	0
They are also relatively versatile ; different types of exam questions , for example , multiple-choice questions and essay tasks , can test different sorts of reasoning ability . 	0
However , exams also have some drawbacks . 	1
Besides , when we practice outdoors and indoors sports , many aspects are getting clearer . 	1
For example , when a person goes jogging everyday , eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation . 	0
Physical exercises help to create healthy nation , assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country . 	1
First of all , the ancient Latin proverb says : " Anima sana in corpore sano " , which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul . 	0
Physical exercise 	0
Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics , I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed . 	1
Additionally , there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity : gradually , step by step we change physical condition to better . 	0
So , if the entire nation , from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday , eventually it may help to build healthy nation . 	1
There is a direct linkage between people ' s health and the frequency of doing physical exercises . 	0
The more we practice , the better we feel . 	0
However , reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment . 	1
In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	0
As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . 	1
When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . 	0
For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . 	0
Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . 	0
First of all , many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones . 	1
Despite all these positive aspects , I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development . 	1
Nowadays , many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends . 	0
Popularity of mobile phones to young people 	0
I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends . 	0
In my college days , I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone . 	0
Similarly , internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works . 	0
Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time , leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities . 	0
Secondly , juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic . 	1
That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester . 	0
To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . 	0
So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food . 	1
This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming . 	1
Further , government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy . 	0
In the same way , the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution . 	0
To conclude , it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy . 	1
Secondly , the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming . 	1
For example , the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming . 	0
Knowledge is the base of creativity . 	0
The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world , inspires children and encourage them to create new things . 	1
However , with highly advanced technology , children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends . 	0
Therefore , they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking . 	0
Second , technology widen children ' s knowledge . 	0
In the past , children were only able to see things from one perspective . 	0
In the end , he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight . 	0
At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . 	1
From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	0
Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . 	0
Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . 	0
Students need to work as part time basis . 	0
Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . 	1
Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . 	1
For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . 	0
However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . 	1
When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	0
Therefore , requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them . 	1
People can understand more about a country , it is useful to ease tensions between nations . 	0
In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
Sense of cooperation 	0
A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals . 	0
In my personal experience , all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck . 	1
Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way . 	0
First , if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments , you are taking a great risk . 	1
Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal . 	0
If it doesn ' t work , it would be a great disappointment . 	0
There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine . 	0
Luck vs hard work 	0
Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one ' s hard work that helps him reach his target . 	1
However , I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one ' s goals . 	1
However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . 	0
Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . 	1
Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . 	0
The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . 	0
Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition . 	1
The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . 	0
Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success . 	1
Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . 	1
However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . 	0
Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . 	1
Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	0
Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	0
Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . 	0
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
On the other hand , sometimes I would rather learning on my own . 	1
Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher . 	1
Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available , I get discouraged after spending a lot of time . 	0
A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier . 	0
Different people prefer different styles of learning . 	0
Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own 	0
Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning . 	1
I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful . 	1
And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won ' t get discouraged and confused . 	1
In this situation , I ' ll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her . 	0
They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily . 	1
To some extent , it is true . 	0
Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . 	0
According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . 	0
Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . 	0
In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language . 	1
Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ' , does not have access to . 	1
On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice . 	0
There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language . 	0
When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible . 	1
It varies from individual to individual , how they utilize that period . 	0
But , the break should be an optional thing . 	0
Importantly , the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them . 	1
A break gives students more benefits than harms . 	0
Countries , like India , where such a break is considered a blot , should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition . 	0
Thus , a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies . 	1
One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life . 	0
Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
In other words , those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination . 	1
Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . 	0
Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work . 	0
To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . 	0
For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . 	0
Secondly , by taking a part-time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . 	1
Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life . 	1
In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . 	1
I belive this , due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students . 	1
Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right . 	1
I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ’ t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them . 	0
In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively . 	0
Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students . 	1
Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides . 	1
However , standardized tests offer them such chance . 	0
In the conclusion , I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education , the more influence we can get on academic success of students . 	1
Alike , the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically . 	0
Furthermore , almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation , which is a part of physical education . 	0
Last , but not least , financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is . 	1
For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . 	0
Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . 	0
As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . 	0
Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . 	1
As hence it ends up with financially competitive country . 	0
Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers . 	1
Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects . 	0
Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own . 	0
Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice . 	0
In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them . 	0
Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students . 	0
For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue . 	0
Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students . 	1
However , I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge . 	1
This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it . 	0
The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams . 	0
Students should be required to take regular standardized tests 	0
In conclusion , I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators , as there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co-workers , working conditions and professional achievements . 	1
All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life . 	0
However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . 	0
In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . 	0
International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions 	0
For example in FIFA World Cup 2010 , the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking . 	0
An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world . 	0
The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action . 	0
However , due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism . 	0
Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . 	0
Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . 	0
Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	1
And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . 	0
In conclusion , fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships . 	1
Therefore , I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity . 	0
So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use . 	0
When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society . 	0
The use of public transportation make us live more sociable . 	1
Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources . 	1
When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life . 	0
The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air . 	0
They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer . 	0
The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy . 	0
If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted . 	0
Admittedly , technology may have negative effects on children . 	1
In my view , both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art . 	0
In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages . 	0
With the development of globalization , English became the dominated language in national trade , conference and many important events . 	0
Advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English 	0
Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people . 	1
This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public . 	0
In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas . 	0
First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly . 	0
If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well . 	0
Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers . 	0
Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . 	1
Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . 	0
I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . 	0
Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . 	1
People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . 	0
For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . 	0
After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . 	0
Nobody has a life with a lot of fun ; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone , but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual ' s live . 	1
In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . 	0
Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes . 	1
Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	1
On the other hand , creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like . 	1
But , we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity . 	1
Personally , English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications . 	1
Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system . 	0
However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct . 	1
Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity . 	0
It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious . 	0
Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ? 	0
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
Some of them had no own savings . 	0
As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
Saving / Spending money 	0
Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
Importantly , when students start their university studies after a break , they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge . 	0
Nevertheless , during high school , many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in . 	0
A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot , to follow instructions . 	0
Personally , a break will give students some time to refresh their systems , by traveling or following their hobbies . 	1
In most education systems , a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age . 	0
A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change . 	0
Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies , while in some countries , it is considered as waste of time . 	0
However , a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school . 	1
Is a break good or bad after high school for students 	0
Studies are an essential part of life . 	0
Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on . 	0
The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution . 	1
The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society . 	1
Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources 	0
So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it . 	0
Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community . 	1
Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move . 	0
The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out . 	1
Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person . 	0
If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly . 	0
Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . 	1
Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . 	0
Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . 	0
When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . 	0
However , strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society . 	1
Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases . 	0
Retribution is the method for countering criminals . 	0
Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . 	0
Capital punishment - necessary or not 	0
Crime is always punishable . 	0
I firmly believe that psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment . 	1
Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society . 	1
However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict . 	0
Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner . 	1
They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students . 	0
Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance . 	0
Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information . 	0
For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product . 	0
To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance . 	0
Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers . 	1
Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance . 	1
Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give . 	0
Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does . 	1
He realized that having a master ' s degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors . 	0
Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply . 	0
At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity . 	0
Although it is good to be lucky , depending on luck for everything is not good . 	1
Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . 	0
This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	1
The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . 	0
In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . 	0
But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . 	0
This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	0
People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . 	1
It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . 	0
To conclude , the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons . 	1
Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years . 	1
Wherever possible , exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment . 	0
Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills . 	0
In this case , teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested , thus narrowing the educational experience for all . 	0
A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns . 	1
However , exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system . 	1
Other types of assessment should also be considered , assignment writing , for example , to assess independent learning and research skills , or group projects , to measure teamwork ability . 	0
In conclusion , it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement . 	1
For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . 	0
I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . 	0
This is basic part of the lives . 	0
There may be small or big things , but at last people should accept them , because most of them is about responsibilities . 	0
In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards other people 	0
People should sometimes do things , even though they don ' t enjoy it . 	0
Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . 	0
In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . 	1
Moreover , sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live . 	0
In this essay , the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored . 	1
I wish one day this problem would be changed . 	0
To sum up , the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people ’ s living . 	1
And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community . 	0
Also , it provides many advantages . 	0
Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . 	0
The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars . 	1
For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . 	0
Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study . 	0
For instance , university students who study business are also know history of the world . 	0
Furthermore , students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers . 	0
Hence , they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another . 	0
Finally , students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career . 	1
This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer . 	0
For example , students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include . 	0
Moreover , bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge . 	0
In concluding , learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future . 	1
In today ' s world , having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families , the smallest component of the society . 	0
As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? 	0
The first reason why the father ' s role should be equal to the mother ' s role is the nature of parantage . 	1
While mother ' s role is essential in a child ' s life , I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood . 	1
For example , in a traditional Turkish family , while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child , a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child . 	0
In my view , the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child ' s characteristics . 	0
In my opinion , we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life , including relationships . 	0
The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today . 	1
Instead , all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals . 	0
For instance , a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today ' s society . 	0
It is rare times when people can learn about this country . 	0
It really help to alleviate the tension . 	1
Besides easing tensions , an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way . 	1
When they garther together to encourage their team , they will show their patriotic emotions . 	0
Regardless of the competition between teams , their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport . 	0
Moreover , all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media . 	0
They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people . 	0
In Olympic Beijing 2008 , Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country . 	0
First of all , foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students . 	0
They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality , beauty in each cities . 	0
They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age . 	1
Nonetheless , with the development of technology , increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products . 	0
In comfortable conditions , children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change . 	0
Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century . 	0
Environmental protection vs Economic developments 	0
However , since the budget and the recourse are limited , governments must choose between these two issues . 	0
They are both important because they are vital to human ' s future and welfare . 	0
The following are reasons why . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments . 	1
All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one . 	0
First , environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments . 	1
Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well . 	0
Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she ' s gone . 	0
The potential market in those poor countries , most of which has a huge population , is also a thing worth mentioning . 	0
By building a good relationship with them , wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market , but also facilitate future international commerce . 	0
Compassion , a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism , is what distinguishes us human beings from animals . 	0
Economically speaking , such aid could also create a win-win situation . 	1
For developed nations , new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations ; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem , promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry . 	0
Should wealthy nations support poor ones ? 	0
Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones , by means of providing infrastructures , or remain bystander of the global poverty , is an issue of controversy . 	0
Personally I think , as the privileged minority , wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor . 	1
In terms of ethics , it is inhumane to watch one ' s fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help , especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so . 	1
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run . 	1
The underdeveloped nations , in return , may export local agricultural products , mineral products with discount to the former , boosting each other ' s economy . 	0
In summary , wealthy nations ' offering in need is not only a moral deed , but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways . 	1
The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place , as I said back . 	1
I personaly tend to visit museums when I ' m in a new place because it ' s good for me know about the culture , tradition and history of other places . 	1
Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places , other people don ' t like to visit museums . 	0
Reasons why travelers visit Museums ? 	0
However , other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip . 	1
And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you . 	0
Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations . 	0
And also taking the chance for making friends . 	0
In coclusion , the museums are a visual source to know the history , tradition and culture of any place in the world . 	1
My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum , it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works , and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums . 	0
Some universities require students to study in one subject . 	0
On the contrary , others require students to study in several subjects . 	0
Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject 	0
University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life . 	0
This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all . 	0
For example , pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music . 	0
In my point of view , studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in , they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future . 	1
First of all , when students finished their high schools , they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities . 	0
In addition , people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one . 	1
For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
The following will present my points . 	0
As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically . 	1
In a nutshell , although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures , some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time . 	1
Therefore , to make use of time , if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do . 	1
An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days , wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents . 	0
Furthermore , most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want . 	0
Relatively , these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost . 	0
They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand . 	0
Therefore , I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones . 	0
This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person ’ s education and character . 	1
This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . 	0
For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . 	0
Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines 	0
Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . 	0
With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . 	0
Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . 	0
But many other still thinks they are going to stay . 	0
I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time . 	1
I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news . 	1
A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . 	0
Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds . 	0
For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high . 	0
Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality . 	0
Teachers could augment their quality . 	0
Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality . 	1
Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily . 	0
Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance . 	0
Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students . 	1
Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students . 	0
In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance . 	1
As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life . 	0
However , there are also disadvantages . 	0
A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental . 	1
When students work during these breaks , the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia . 	0
For instance , my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted . 	0
Working or traveling for some time , after high school , can help them to find their field of interest . 	1
It will also help them to learn professional setup by working . 	0
Financially , students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job . 	0
Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course . 	0
When he started his university studies , he failed miserably . 	0
Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time . 	0
When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . 	0
This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . 	1
As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	0
In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . 	0
With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year . 	0
should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? 	0
From my perspective , fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles . 	1
However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . 	0
Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	1
Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . 	0
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
However , some people point that technology has made children less creative . 	0
I don ' t deny that technology may have some negative effects on children , but I think technology makes children even more creative . 	1
First , technology inspires children to create new things . 	0
Children are curious about everything around them , so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone , they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works . 	0
Technology inspires children ' s creativity instead of weakening it 	0
Technology accelerates human ' s evolving pace . 	0
With advanced technology , many things that seemed impossible in the past , have become realities . 	0
For example , people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen , both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet . 	0
For example , Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer , then he did everything he could to understand how it worked . 	0
After he had figured out all the stuff , he then began to promote the computer . 	0
I think it ' s fun and educational . 	1
If the government encourage the use of nuclear , solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity . 	0
Therefore , it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources . 	1
Firstly , the major source of energy today is water . 	0
Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source . 	0
To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short . 	0
Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India . 	0
Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy 	0
The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past . 	0
It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly . 	0
I will analyze these areas in the essay . 	0
Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now . 	0
Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . 	0
In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons . 	1
Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . 	0
Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . 	0
Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life 	0
At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . 	0
Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . 	0
Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . 	1
First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . 	0
No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills . 	0
He also has access to the most up-to-date language . 	0
On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives . 	0
He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country . 	0
Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language . 	0
Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way . 	0
Person ' A ' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method . 	1
In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country . 	0
Where to learn a new language ? 	0
Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries . 	1
In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . 	0
Factor of choosing a career . 	0
To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . 	1
Nevertheless , while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor , I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard . 	1
People , for instance , who don ' t like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . 	0
However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work-place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . 	0
Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . 	0
In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position . 	0
For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries . 	0
In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . 	1
For example , if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming , you ' ll have to find a teacher . 	0
There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor . 	1
By the way , if you are going to learn some things by yourself , you may learn and understand them incorrectly ! 	0
It ' s almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own . 	0
There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won ' t have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes . 	1
For example , from my own experiences , after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher , I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo , but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits , I was able to play properly . 	0
I can utilize them as tutorials for many things . 	0
In today ' s world there are many great and useful sources available like books , electronic books , the internet and TV and satellite . 	0
In sum , sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own . 	1
For instance , I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites . 	0
Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . 	0
Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . 	0
However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . 	0
In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one ’ s needs but transportation . 	0
One important thing that I want to change about my hometown 	0
Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . 	0
And this problem seem to get worst . 	0
At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . 	1
So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation . 	1
Since I ’ m facing the traffic congestion every day . 	1
Recently , there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication . 	0
Mobile phone ; " Iron man " / " Weichat " - destroy social interactions ? 	0
However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems . 	1
Indeed , mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages , bringing convenience and entertainment into our life . 	0
In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . 	0
In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . 	1
Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as " Iron man " . 	0
Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children . 	0
For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . 	0
In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . 	0
A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40% , which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic . 	0
That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides . 	0
First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring . 	1
In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor . 	0
Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies . 	1
In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country . 	0
Should all the advertisements be banned ? 	0
Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information . 	0
Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public . 	0
My view is that while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring . 	1
However , if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned , advertisements would be welcomed by more . 	0
Taken all together , advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth . 	1
We can not deny all of them . 	0
Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies . 	1
Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides . 	0
Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child ' s life starting from the the birth 	0
In conclusion , the time-saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals . 	1
Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . 	0
More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . 	0
This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	1
Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly . 	1
