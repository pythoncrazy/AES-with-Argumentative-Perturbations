It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away . 	0
Besides , advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle . 	1
We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles . 	0
there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . 	0
Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? 	0
Also , we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students . 	0
Next , students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades . 	0
As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams . 	0
Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights . 	0
First of all , as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study . 	1
In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice , to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude . 	1
High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in . 	0
Educated high-school students with bright and independent mind 	0
Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit . 	1
For example , when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other . 	0
Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . 	0
Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . 	0
Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors . 	0
But from my experience , I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit . 	1
Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors . 	0
People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities . 	0
One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . 	1
For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . 	0
Also , outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty . 	1
There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . 	0
I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
Although there are valid arguments to the contrary , it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication . 	1
Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . 	0
With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . 	0
To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . 	0
With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . 	0
Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . 	0
Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	1
Although , they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do , but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team . 	1
If student do it by themselves , they might be hurt themselves . 	0
Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way . 	0
Lastly , learning in classroom , student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body . 	1
This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes . 	0
For instance , In a classroom , teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group . 	0
Secondly , online class could not provide knowledge about social skills . 	1
Unlike classroom , online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation . 	0
In conclusion , I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class . 	1
This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide . 	0
Second , learning abilities in each students is different . 	0
If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	0
Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . 	0
It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . 	0
This problems depend on how hard study they do . 	0
Therefore , testing result are different . 	0
Still , I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	1
In other words , students can procure more advantages from better facilities . 	1
Based on the reasons demonstrate above , I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other . 	1
It is not teachers fault . 	0
Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered . 	0
In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity . 	1
As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	1
Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . 	0
In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . 	0
Thus , I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers . 	1
To conclude , I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life . 	1
We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . 	0
However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . 	0
They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . 	0
Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	1
Celebrities & Their Influences 	0
Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . 	0
To some extent , I do not agree with this statement . 	0
First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . 	1
Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . 	0
We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . 	0
The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . 	0
The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	0
An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . 	0
The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . 	0
Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . 	0
Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . 	1
Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail 	0
When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication . 	1
Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . 	0
Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . 	0
When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience . 	1
In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life . 	1
I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail . 	0
I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems . 	0
Firstly , communicating by e-mail is easy . 	1
There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay . 	0
Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face , personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better . 	1
Communicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face 	0
As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day . 	0
Secondly , you can write an e-mail at any time of the day . 	1
In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident . 	0
Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with . 	0
Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends . 	0
Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying . 	1
Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class . 	0
Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas . 	0
Although , online classes have many advantages , for me , I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons . 	1
First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying . 	1
Almost every school develops their online class systems . 	0
One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning . 	0
Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom 	0
During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society . 	0
After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens . 	0
At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . 	0
Personally , I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help . 	1
Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	0
So that , I disagree with this notion . 	0
Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . 	1
Everyone is different . 	0
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . 	0
Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . 	0
Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . 	1
In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice . 	0
Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages . 	1
To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky . 	1
Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money . 	0
It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation . 	0
To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . 	0
To my view , I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs . 	1
Yet , the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others . 	1
Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . 	0
Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	0
Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . 	0
Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . 	0
On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . 	1
It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . 	0
Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . 	1
It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . 	0
Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . 	0
Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	0
Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs 	0
With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . 	0
However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . 	0
The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion . 	0
Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
Admittedly , the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student ' s own interest . 	0
Apparently , this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art . 	0
Thus , the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student ' s interest of art without adding extra study pressure . 	1
The education of art and music would not work if students resist it . 	0
Art and music are , of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life . 	0
Obviously , with the improvement of life rhythm , people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs , and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself . 	0
At this moment , they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved . 	0
When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings , such as the Mona Lisa , people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for . 	0
In a nutshell , in the modern society , since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure , younger students ' art and music education should not take the second place . 	1
That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously . 	1
Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . 	1
It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country . 	0
To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . 	1
This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole . 	0
This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . 	0
Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice . 	1
The professor provides good answers to you . 	0
They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem . 	0
In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important . 	0
During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library . 	0
These activities lead to more interact with their friends . 	0
Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies . 	0
While the online course keeps the children at their home only . 	0
The professor has been assigned to teach only . 	0
Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question . 	0
Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . 	0
Do modern communication technologies benefit all people 	0
All advantages considered , classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school . 	1
Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension . 	0
In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe . 	0
On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . 	1
First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . 	1
This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . 	0
That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . 	0
The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . 	0
Keeping animals in zoos 	0
Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . 	0
Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . 	0
Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . 	0
Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . 	1
In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . 	0
For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . 	0
To sum up , technology has helped us to have more comfortable life . 	1
But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily . 	0
You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth . 	1
This could help students to learn how to deal with people , how to collaborate with people in their group . 	0
Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	0
In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . 	0
Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant . 	1
Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . 	1
With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	0
That is problem in quality of education . 	0
Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . 	0
Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life 	0
Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends . 	1
In my view , I prefer the second attitude . 	0
The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences . 	1
For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before . 	0
Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement . 	1
This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends . 	0
In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same . 	0
Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded . 	1
For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages . 	0
In my opinion , though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level , but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run ; while on the contrary , co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team . 	1
Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily . 	1
Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . 	0
But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not . 	0
Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . 	0
Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . 	0
Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . 	0
Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . 	0
Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone 	0
First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . 	1
There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows . 	0
And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail . 	1
When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail . 	0
For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite . 	0
Thirdly , when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself . 	1
To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail . 	1
You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business . 	0
If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure . 	0
Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective . 	0
Taking all into account , I think that living in the city is much better nowadays , because of the opportunities it gives . 	1
Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness . 	0
However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location . 	1
The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication . 	1
On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . 	0
Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . 	0
I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . 	0
Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . 	0
After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	0
Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . 	1
When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . 	0
My mother took me to The National Camp . 	0
At first , I just ate and played alone . 	0
But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . 	0
So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . 	0
On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work . 	0
Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens . 	0
The work of chopping , blending , grating , kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes . 	0
Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome . 	1
After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth . 	1
The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy . 	1
Therefore , it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free . 	0
Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example . 	0
To begin with , learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt . 	1
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Consequently , I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course . 	1
Besides , learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills , and learning how to solve problem in real situation . 	0
Learning in classroom could provide more information to study . 	0
Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes ? 	0
In any case , a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . 	0
Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . 	0
He granted huge sums for such idea . 	0
Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . 	0
I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste . 	1
Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job . 	1
Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . 	1
Therefore , the progress of news media is an advantageous development . 	1
Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . 	0
In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . 	0
The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . 	0
High sum of money of modern artist 	0
Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . 	0
It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . 	0
Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . 	1
I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in . 	1
On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . 	0
For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . 	0
All in all , I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way . 	1
In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . 	0
Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . 	0
Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	1
In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . 	0
In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . 	0
Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . 	0
In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future . 	1
The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . 	0
Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . 	0
Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable 	0
Because children are poor at time management , and are less mature to make a good judgment , they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies . 	1
However , it doesn ' t mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching . 	0
In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained , I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue . 	1
In conclusion , people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation . 	1
In conclusion , advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter . 	1
People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines . 	0
As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations . 	0
It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors . 	0
Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods . 	0
In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people . 	1
Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added . 	0
These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good . 	0
In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle . 	0
Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . 	1
In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	0
The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . 	0
To sum up , in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves , I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas . 	1
Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both . 	0
Universities giving both genders equal opportunities , will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run . 	1
For example , students studying in boy ' s colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them . 	0
On the other hand , females studying in girl ' s colleges are too shy to face boys . 	0
Women like Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi , Mari Curie etc . , are symbols of women ' s intelligence and skills . 	0
Unfortunately , some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields , like maths , mechanical engineering , defense etc . This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society . 	1
Time and again , women have proved their mettle in every field . 	0
Equality in education will help in development of the society . 	1
I , in my childhood , was just a typical case . 	0
Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents . 	1
First of all , children generally have weak self-control , and thus they lose their time easily . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively . 	1
Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . 	0
For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . 	0
In 19th century , television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house . 	0
Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school ? 	0
I could watch TV for hours , but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes . 	0
Whenever I back to home from school , the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours . 	0
Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog . 	0
For example , in biology class , learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits . 	0
There are many advantages of distance learning , but it should not replace classroom learning . 	1
Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . 	0
I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	0
Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . 	1
The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . 	0
With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . 	0
In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	0
In conclusion , the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale . 	1
Although there are some inevitable problems , they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken . 	1
However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention . 	0
Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced . 	0
In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . 	1
Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . 	0
This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . 	0
Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . 	0
Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . 	0
Both these factors have their own values , and have been discussed in detail below : Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently . 	1
Some people think that it is better to make them competitive , while other believes to make them co-operative . 	0
It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind , and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life . 	0
People should create a sense of co-operation in their children 	0
However , those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead . 	0
For example , MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work , and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team . 	0
This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead , but will also restrict them in many ways . 	0
This factor initially arises from the school , where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system , and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks . 	0
It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body . 	0
However , advertising is not the only information source for people . 	0
They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things . 	0
Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life . 	0
The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits 	0
Advertising is becoming part of our modern society . 	0
First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit . 	1
The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self-control . 	0
In my opinion , the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits . 	1
Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . 	0
They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . 	0
By way of conclusion , I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases ; however , the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it . 	1
Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	1
Because , classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject . 	0
Besides , classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill . 	0
For example , Chanda Kochhar , who is the CEO of India ' s second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country ' s most powerful female head in business sector . 	0
In addition , due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments , female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace , despite its intensive stress and pressure . 	0
In today ' s context , education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one ' s future . 	0
Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity 	0
There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position . 	0
In my personal opinion , I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses . 	1
Nowadays , both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education . 	0
To begin with , judging student ' s skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular . 	1
Furthermore , female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops , unlike previous generation females . 	1
In India , for example , female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations . 	0
For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . 	0
Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	0
Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . 	0
Work for themselves vs work for employer 	0
Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , I would prefer to have my own job . 	1
My arguments are listed as follows . 	0
First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . 	1
By having my own business , I can manage my own time . 	0
I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . 	0
I can arrange time to travel when I would like . 	0
In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . 	0
Moreover , classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health . 	0
Thus , having classroom could provide abundant skills to students . 	1
A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study . 	0
It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards . 	0
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well . 	1
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
With this distinguished performance , the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities . 	1
Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school . 	0
He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance . 	0
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms . 	0
They have numerous activities in school . 	0
Furthermore , the city has well-organised lines of transport . 	0
Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits . 	0
Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge . 	1
Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too . 	0
There are not only more jobs , but they are also well-paid . 	0
In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside . 	1
This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places . 	0
Firstly , in the city there is much better education system . 	1
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside . 	1
Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside 	0
People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . 	0
It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity . 	0
This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days . 	0
Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades . 	0
Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . 	0
As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . 	0
The long and the short of it , both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly . 	1
Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! 	0
After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted . 	0
As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back . 	0
In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly . 	0
First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness . 	0
In the following , I will state my reason for this choice . 	0
Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives . 	1
It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities . 	0
There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes . 	0
Financial support for sports and social activities 	0
In addition , studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax . 	1
It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted . 	0
Classmates ' impacts on children ' s performance at school 	0
It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments . 	0
Their success should be attributed to many different external factors . 	0
To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children . 	1
However , in my opinion , the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements . 	1
From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances . 	0
In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same . 	0
It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents . 	0
To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none . 	1
Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments ? 	0
Live football game at a stadium 	0
If you have a great love with football and your home team , it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone . 	1
Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team ' s match , yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there ? 	0
Before the match starts , thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags , colorful outfits , sound of trumpets and rattles . . . everywhere . 	0
First , attending a live football match is very fulfilling . 	1
You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40 , 000 people at the stadium , such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home . 	0
As the game kicks off , the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting . 	0
See , you will be bored if you are watching it alone . 	0
Everybody yells and sings together , the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored . 	0
If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks . 	0
If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder . 	0
The more money , the more chances . 	0
Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks . 	1
This fact pushes them to work faster and faster . 	0
For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary . 	0
Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased . 	1
If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money . 	0
He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him . 	0
My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working . 	0
Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other . 	0
It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together . 	0
Should universities accept equal number of males / females or not 	0
Education is important for the development of the world . 	0
Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not . 	0
However , since both genders are equally important , both must be given equal opportunities . 	0
Universities must admit both in equal numbers , depending on their choices . 	1
Right to education is a basic human right of both , males and females . 	0
The whole world aims for women empowerment , and to achieve this , females should be given equal opportunities as males . 	1
When universities will accept them in equal number , both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop . 	0
Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	0
While we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience . 	1
In conclusion , I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient . 	1
While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . 	0
Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	1
Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . 	0
Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . 	1
But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools . 	0
In conclusion , traditional learning still has many benefits to the students . 	1
These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . 	0
Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	0
Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated , with a bright and independent mind . 	0
In conclusion , as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well . 	1
Furthermore , this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses . 	1
When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education . 	0
Lastly , the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she / he has an aptitude . 	0
Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get . 	1
Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . 	0
Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . 	0
This problem should not be happened . 	0
Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	1
However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . 	0
In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act . 	0
Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . 	0
Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . 	0
Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	0
In conclusion , it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence . 	1
On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . 	1
Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . 	0
Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . 	0
As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	1
On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . 	0
An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . 	0
Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . 	0
Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence . 	0
Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? 	0
The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . 	0
Therefore , we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students . 	1
Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . 	0
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have , the more chances we can increase our knowledge . 	0
Problems and benefits of international tourism 	0
Improving facilities is the best way 	0
Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities , while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students . 	0
In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . 	0
For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . 	0
Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . 	1
Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented . 	1
A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . 	0
Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . 	0
Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . 	0
It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run . 	1
As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . 	0
The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . 	0
Prohibit public smoking ? 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
Government should take interim measures , to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit . 	0
In conclusion , I am firmly supporting the view , that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects , provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender . 	1
These machines reduce the physical work done by humans . 	0
Machines - positive or negative for humans 	0
It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people . 	1
For example , in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days . 	0
Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans . 	0
Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached . 	0
First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . 	0
The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . 	0
It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge . 	1
Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development . 	0
Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . 	0
However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . 	0
The popularity of news media 	0
Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . 	0
People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . 	0
This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . 	0
If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy , you will be " on site " to witness and celebrate the victory . 	0
Furthermore , it can be an exclusive experience . 	0
It can be unforgettable moments in your life . 	1
In conclusion , watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing , but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable . 	1
You can watch it at home , but " easy come , easy go " , you will quickly forget it , like a movie . 	0
Second , watching a live football game is an exceptional experience . 	1
You can cherish your experience for a long time . 	0
The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive , but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game . 	0
If we follow just one wing of my life i . e . , studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation . 	0
Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments . 	1
So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support . 	1
In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment . 	0
Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment . 	0
As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation . 	0
Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life . 	0
As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health . 	1
In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me . 	0
Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
Living in a higher pace is better 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
I agree with this viewpoint to some extent . 	0
Admittedly , in concerning the social relationship with peers , some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation . 	1
How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors ? 	0
It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health . 	1
What ' s even worse , according to some statistics , there are more and more children have violent tendency , and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies . 	0
Recently , more and more children smoke because they imitate actors ' behaviors on TV or movies . 	0
Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad , therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity . 	0
Moreover , sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children . 	0
I , therefore , did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying . 	0
I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing , but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook . 	0
It enriches people ' s knowledge with worldwide information . 	0
It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects . 	0
This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . 	0
Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	0
In conclusion , the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people . 	1
It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news . 	0
Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	1
In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . 	1
It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . 	0
Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . 	0
Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time . 	1
There ' s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book , watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy . 	0
Admittedly , indoor activities are fun . 	1
After all , people are people and we have our own propensity . 	0
Although I can also have fun in indoor activities , this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities . 	1
Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . 	1
If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	0
Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	1
If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . 	0
Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly 	0
There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . 	0
On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . 	1
Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	1
If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . 	0
This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . 	0
Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . 	0
And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education . 	0
Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . 	0
Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? 	0
Educational rights must be given to both genders . 	0
Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit , irrespective of the gender . 	0
Undoubtedly , math , language , science and history are all extremely important subjects in student ' s education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world . 	0
Younger school children should study art and music 	0
Nevertheless , the art and music , from my point of view , are also essential for younger student ' s future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays . 	1
Therefore , some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students . 	0
First of all , art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful . 	1
In this case , I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study . 	1
Under this circumstance , learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures . 	0
It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures . 	0
For instance , students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven ' s most notable workpiece is played . 	0
In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . 	0
Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . 	1
Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . 	0
Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated 	0
Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more . 	1
Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . 	0
First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . 	1
In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view . 	0
Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	0
With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . 	0
First , making college education free would cost too much . 	1
However , I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college . 	0
Should the Government Provide Free College ? 	0
Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds . 	0
In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education . 	0
There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools . 	0
It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth . 	0
Not everyone wants to go to a college . 	0
Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college . 	0
If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . 	0
However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . 	1
Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . 	0
With this convenient and versatile facility , students can improve their learning condition . 	0
For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . 	0
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to spend money on improving facilities . 	1
I disagree with this view . 	0
For example , library is a good place for students to study or research . 	0
They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience ; also , there are a lot of references for students to utilize . 	0
Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers , and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . 	1
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior . 	0
People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds . 	0
Third , there are many ways to fund a college education . 	1
Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government . 	1
People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education . 	0
While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial . 	0
They also provide funds for academic research . 	0
They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students . 	0
In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means . 	0
Otherwise , it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government . 	1
In short , the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice . 	1
In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . 	1
Besides , learning abilities of student are different . 	1
If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace . 	0
For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly . 	0
I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons . 	0
Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice . 	1
To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study . 	1
Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter . 	0
More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes 	0
Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully . 	0
These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company . 	0
Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before . 	1
These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . 	0
The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	0
But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts . 	1
Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical . 	0
Investing in hospitals helps improve people ' s health , also , in schools assists with raising our children ' s education level . 	0
Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately , our standard of living would deteriorate . 	0
However , in my perspective , both public services and arts worth investment . 	1
It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing . 	1
