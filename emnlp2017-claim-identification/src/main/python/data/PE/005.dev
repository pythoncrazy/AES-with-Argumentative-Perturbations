Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more . 	1
In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages . 	1
In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together . 	1
Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly . 	0
Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better . 	1
As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased . 	0
Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa . 	0
To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . 	1
However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . 	0
Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . 	0
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives 	0
Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . 	0
Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . 	0
Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . 	0
In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties . 	1
In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . 	0
For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . 	0
We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	0
Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students . 	0
Then , the earlier we jump into this area , the more skillful we will be . 	0
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field 	0
In today ' s community , economy becomes the order of the day . 	0
For the primary concern , it can provide students a sense of direction in academy . 	1
Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field , let them to know what this subject mainly discuss . 	0
Thus , in my point of view , although it will take some time on it , high school students should take a course on basic economics . 	1
Let me explain it in detail . 	0
That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation . 	0
Finally , students may study harder for their economic dreams . 	0
Besides , there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises , students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid . 	1
Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing . 	0
Soccer , on the other hand , developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games . 	0
Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors . 	0
But from my experience , I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit . 	1
Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors . 	0
People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities . 	0
One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one ' s health . 	1
For instance , last year , I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball . 	0
Also , outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty . 	1
There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors . 	0
I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy . 	0
In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
In other words , I prefer to live in high pace . 	1
For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing . 	0
Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible . 	0
Although there are valid arguments to the contrary , it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication . 	1
Yet , there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative . 	0
With the click of a button , the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds . 	0
To begin with , mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business . 	0
With a mobile phone or a laptop , a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop , in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine . 	0
Furthermore , it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits . 	0
Therefore , it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind . 	1
When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . 	0
It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . 	0
To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . 	0
Some of them may have something to offer . 	0
To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . 	0
They failed to give me any useful solutions . 	0
In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will . 	1
He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	0
I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives . 	0
This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help . 	1
For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	0
More power than any friend or other adult could have . 	0
They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	0
Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . 	1
I completely agree that parents are the best teacher . 	1
Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else 	0
Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . 	1
Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children ’ s lives . 	1
That ’ s as important thing because even if the parents don ’ t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . 	0
Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . 	1
Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
I believe that they are important somehow , but not essential . 	1
However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . 	0
Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . 	1
For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	0
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . 	1
For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	0
In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . 	0
Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . 	0
In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . 	0
I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . 	0
Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . 	1
It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . 	0
In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides . 	0
Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . 	0
Should high school make music lessons compulsory 	0
This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	0
Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . 	1
Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . 	0
For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . 	0
Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . 	0
Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . 	0
We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject 	0
There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . 	0
Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students . 	1
On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . 	1
On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	0
I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . 	0
This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	0
What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . 	1
A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . 	0
I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	0
Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . 	1
There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . 	0
Considering all the benefits , I would choose to live in a big city . 	1
In conclusion , while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air , big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places . 	1
The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget , while it takes 30 hours for the later one . 	0
The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other . 	0
An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity . 	0
The first group was asked to discuss in person , while the second group was asked to discuss by email . 	0
Firstly , team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently . 	0
Obviously , discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails . 	1
Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail 	0
When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email , I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication . 	1
Secondly , work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members . 	0
Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official , therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing . 	0
Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? 	0
It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . 	0
This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . 	0
From my point of view , I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study . 	1
In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . 	0
Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . 	0
Imagine an actor who is a child ’ s favorite is doing violent roles . 	0
Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . 	0
After all , the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens . 	0
At the same time , citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas . 	0
Personally , I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education , who are the group in real need for the authority ' s help . 	1
Instead , the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members ' wellbeing , such as soaring crime rate , AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure , which are requiring financial resources from the government to address . 	0
In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
On the other hand , economy is always correlate with politics , students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status , which may open their vision toward the nation and don ' t get limited in the textbooks . 	0
Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . 	0
They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . 	0
On the whole , I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in . 	1
They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time , with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students . 	0
That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible . 	0
Considering all those factors above , I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary . 	1
Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors . 	0
Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . 	0
On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . 	0
Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . 	0
Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . 	0
Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? 	0
In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . 	0
To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . 	0
From my point of view , children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons . 	1
Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . 	1
Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . 	0
It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . 	0
Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . 	0
Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
Computers have opened up a network connection among people . 	0
Computers have an important role in social and personal life . 	1
A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers . 	1
Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . 	0
By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . 	1
Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . 	0
Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . 	0
This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . 	0
People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees . 	0
The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . 	0
If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . 	0
Then we will feel less interested in them . 	0
However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper . 	1
First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . 	0
While there are also some people who do not like this . 	0
Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . 	0
Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones , e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years . 	0
Do modern communication technologies benefit all people 	0
Without their research , there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth . 	0
Without their research , there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	0
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence . 	0
One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies . 	1
For example , students might face many challenges in the host country . 	0
Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter . 	0
First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country . 	1
Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character . 	0
Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that . 	0
Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . 	0
The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system 	0
Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . 	1
However , I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential . 	1
With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	0
It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . 	0
Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . 	0
Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . 	1
Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . 	1
In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . 	0
Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . 	0
For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	0
The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . 	0
It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . 	0
To conclude , no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing , handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people , especially students at the early age . 	1
In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city . 	0
Small town vs . Big city ( opportunities , entertainment , job places ) 	0
Big city life provides many opportunities . 	0
As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places , I think I would prefer to live in a city . 	1
Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . 	0
First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . 	0
At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . 	1
Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	1
Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . 	0
There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . 	0
For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
On the next day , we played together and she introduced me to her friends . 	0
Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing , climbing the mountain , I had a lot of friends since The National Camp . 	0
I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly . 	0
Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit , make me ultimately refreshed . 	0
After that summer , my body is stronger and endurance is better . 	0
Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people . 	1
When I was ten years old , I was a shy girl . 	0
My mother took me to The National Camp . 	0
At first , I just ate and played alone . 	0
But on the third day , while I was swimming , a friendly girl came and greeted me , we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively . 	0
This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	0
Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . 	1
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
In any case , a musician playing " I swear " several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation . 	0
Striking contrast , labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day . 	0
He granted huge sums for such idea . 	0
Pieter Padang , Minion creator , has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric " I swear " become " underwear " when the Minion sing in Despicable Me . 	0
I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste . 	1
Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art , while the term of struggle might different with other field of job . 	1
Moreover , government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it , art value is about taste . 	1
Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation , critics against such view . 	0
In a field of art , modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money . 	0
The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair . 	0
High sum of money of modern artist 	0
Also , the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent . 	0
It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector . 	0
Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work . 	1
I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in . 	1
On the other hand , modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do , such making impossible become possible . 	0
For example , a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production . 	0
In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . 	0
To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	0
Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . 	0
Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . 	1
Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . 	0
Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . 	0
In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . 	0
By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . 	0
Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country . 	0
They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life . 	0
Learning about others ' cultures is so important . 	0
It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world . 	0
For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system . 	0
They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country . 	0
Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience . 	1
While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country . 	0
It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts . 	0
Also it educates us about the world we are living in . 	0
A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . 	0
Popular events are essential 	0
Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . 	0
These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . 	0
The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . 	0
As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . 	1
First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
University education is needed for success 	0
I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
In conclusion , I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors . 	1
Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	1
For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . 	0
Furthermore , killing is worse . 	0
In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ’ t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . 	0
Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	1
For example , a child watches a frightening movie . 	0
Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	0
Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . 	1
Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . 	0
We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . 	0
We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . 	0
I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	0
Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . 	1
It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . 	0
You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . 	0
In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . 	0
So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	0
But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . 	0
Some people may be encouraged to do good things . 	0
And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	0
So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . 	1
Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing . 	1
As for students , we can get what we want to know from textbooks , webs or teachers . 	0
All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA , the excellent teacher . 	0
Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing , teaching , we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with , doing research . 	0
Should professors doing more research or educating students more ? 	0
A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject . 	0
In my opinion , a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following . 	1
And then he or she can do better in teaching works . 	0
He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him / herself forward all the time . 	1
He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves . 	0
For instance , the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr . Yang who keeps in researching and reading . 	0
Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . 	0
But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . 	0
And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . 	0
So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . 	1
They will be misleading by those movies . 	0
And they may act like good people in order to get reward . 	0
But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . 	0
I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . 	0
So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	1
Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . 	0
All in all , I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be . 	1
So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	0
Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services . 	0
They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money . 	0
By way of conclusion , I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases ; however , the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn ' t afford it . 	1
Consequently , people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies . 	1
The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . 	0
Also , without sufficient guidance of teachers , these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes , posing a threat to other citizens ' security . 	0
As a result , such people might fail to get cured in time , thus influencing their working efficiency , which would destabilize the production of the industry . 	0
For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . 	0
After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . 	0
In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . 	0
Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . 	0
These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs . 	1
Finally , an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while . 	1
Thus , to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
In a nutshell , I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own . 	1
It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs . 	0
However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . 	0
It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	0
Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	0
While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . 	1
An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory . 	1
On the other hand , music can help an individual to shape its character . 	1
For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . 	0
However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
Economic development vs environment 	0
From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . 	0
Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	1
To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development . 	1
Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
Finally , all professors in the university are fortune of the society . 	0
That is good for both of the professor and students . 	0
Without their research , there will be no new technologies come out quickly . 	1
They are the leaders almost in every fields of science , arts , culture and so on . 	0
If a professor doesn ' t get any researching works , he cannot give us the opportunity . 	1
But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted . 	0
He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions . 	0
In addition , a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time . 	1
Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome . 	0
Since it is a classroom or campus projects , there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas . 	0
While we should realize that in a project , there are numerous coordination works are required , if each opinion is communicated via email , there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience . 	1
In conclusion , I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient . 	1
While if the same words are expressed in talking , the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim . 	0
Therefore , less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights , and enhance the communication amongst the team members . 	1
Admittedly , sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place . 	0
Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none . 	1
In conclusion , a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university . 	1
And it ' s worth to spend more time on it than on teaching . 	0
By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies . 	0
By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them . 	0
Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school . 	0
Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages 	0
In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex . 	1
Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender . 	0
By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate . 	1
School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life . 	0
They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc . Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age . 	0
In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa . 	0
These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
I believe that studying abroad has many advantages . 	1
Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally . 	1
Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience 	0
Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . 	0
At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . 	0
So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	1
Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . 	1
Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out 	0
As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own . 	0
But , the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one . 	0
Personally , I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . 	0
Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . 	0
In addition , the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college . 	1
On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . 	1
Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? 	0
When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . 	0
Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . 	1
If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate . 	1
This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help . 	1
Each makes different decisions . 	0
Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . 	0
Living with a roommate is better than Living alone 	0
Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . 	0
This means you can get more for less . 	0
For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . 	0
But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . 	0
If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully . 	0
I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test . 	0
Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . 	1
I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam . 	0
Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
Living in a higher pace is better 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time . 	1
There ' s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book , watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy . 	0
Admittedly , indoor activities are fun . 	1
After all , people are people and we have our own propensity . 	0
Although I can also have fun in indoor activities , this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities . 	1
Moreover , you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking , sunbathing , going biking . 	1
If , for example , I hadn ' t participate in that camping , I wouldn ' t have had many friends like today . 	0
Spending time outdoors , people can breathe fresh air , feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings . 	1
If you spend your spare time at home or something like that , you can ' t enjoy beautiful nature . 	0
Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources , I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge . 	1
It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge . 	0
Teachers lesson vs other sources 	0
The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change . 	0
Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs . 	0
Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced . 	0
A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time . 	0
Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning . 	1
On the other hand , some people oppose the argument , saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society , since a great number of people , in fact , have had the capacity to pay for the both privately . 	1
Therefore , the government should be accountable for citizens ' health care and education to keep society safe and stable . 	1
If citizens had no access to health care and education , their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk . 	0
This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment , which should be enabled by the government , the leader of the society . 	0
Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens . 	0
And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens ' health care and education . 	0
Despite the development of modern society , the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens . 	0
Government should be responsible for education and health care or not ? 	0
Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
Gun control 	0
For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
It can influence us in different aspects of life . 	0
In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way . 	1
It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	0
In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject . 	1
For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	0
In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . 	0
In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier . 	0
By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . 	1
Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ’ s behaviors . 	1
