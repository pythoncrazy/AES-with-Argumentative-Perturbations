Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . 	0
A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . 	0
There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	0
Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . 	1
And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . 	0
In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . 	0
When many people congregate in one place , I think that some kinds of social problems will follow . 	0
Moreover , when people have jobs , they will have money to spend on goods and services . 	0
Based on the above discussion , I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem . 	1
The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . 	0
Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . 	1
In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	0
Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . 	0
Nonetheless , passion on jobs , in my opinion , can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on . 	1
In conclusion , it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers . 	1
Finally , some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies . 	0
Besides , important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness , satisfaction of jobs , personal relationships , professional skills , working environment , managers and colleagues should not be underestimated . 	0
Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective . 	0
Human life today can ' t be imagined without computers , so not depending on them is out of question . 	0
Thus , dependence on computers is not a bad thing . 	1
However , one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things . 	0
The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful . 	0
Nevertheless , with all the mentioned demerits , computers have provided security and sophistication too . 	1
They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook ) . 	0
Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives . 	0
A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university . 	0
To conclude , Earth is our home and it should be protected . 	1
Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . 	0
Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life . 	0
To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	0
Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . 	1
For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . 	0
Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	0
Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	0
All in all , I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world . 	1
Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	0
Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . 	1
Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . 	0
It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . 	0
To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . 	0
Some of them may have something to offer . 	0
To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . 	0
They failed to give me any useful solutions . 	0
In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will . 	1
He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	0
I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives . 	0
This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help . 	1
This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication . 	0
Despite of the above arguments , i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages . 	1
I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken , every language should be protected from being disappeared . 	1
The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one . 	0
It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
Languages ' extinction , discuss both views 	0
Secondly , it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication , trade , cooperation as well as transaction , it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only . 	1
For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials . 	0
Firstly , we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages , it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them . 	0
There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money . 	1
As a mass media majoring student , I think that it ' s true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society . 	1
Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media 	0
My reasons include the following : It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . 	1
In my point of view , disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages . 	1
However , journalism is changing . 	0
The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . 	0
First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . 	1
Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	0
Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	0
The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . 	0
I believe that they are important somehow , but not essential . 	1
However , while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems , others think that they are just entertainment to distract people . 	0
Moreover , these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs . 	1
For example , the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun . 	0
In conclusion , although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial , it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages . 	1
Therefore , saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity ' s preservation . 	0
On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . 	0
Specifically , price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas , for example , in the farming products and in the real estate area ; however , whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated . 	0
On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . 	0
Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . 	1
As we read newspapers or watch TV , we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues , air and water pollution questions . 	0
Growing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices 	0
As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching , it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems , though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society . 	1
Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems . 	0
As illustrated before , several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems . 	1
In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours . 	0
First , under globalization and industrial integration , the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging . 	1
The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world . 	0
Some people believe that little things changed through generation , while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation . 	1
Challenges are different from generation to generation 	0
While debating about generation issues , people always have different opinions . 	0
If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . 	0
Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . 	0
No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . 	0
It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . 	0
In conclusion , I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly . 	1
In the modern world , computers are used everywhere . 	0
Ever since Charles Babbage ( know as " Father of computers " ) invented computers , its development never had a pause . 	0
Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life . 	0
But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks . 	0
For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months . 	0
However , I believe their concern is groundless . 	0
Instead , technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
In terms of time and space , technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life . 	1
In the past , only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles . 	0
Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not ? 	0
Living in the 21st century , people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity . 	0
Thus , every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years , regardless of any potential problems it may bring about . 	0
Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	0
This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills . 	0
However , with the access to the Internet , one of the greatest innovations in modern society , humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime , anywhere . 	0
Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
In conclusion , the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility , which is important in nearly all areas of life . 	1
I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age , due to reasons that I stated below . 	1
They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . 	0
In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . 	0
Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . 	0
Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation . 	0
From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits . 	1
If I have to choose , I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment . 	1
I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life . 	1
Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want , In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons , because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood . 	1
All in all , the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance . 	1
She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . 	0
One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . 	0
Therefore , it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it . 	1
This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	0
The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . 	0
Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . 	0
Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . 	1
At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	0
This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . 	0
It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health . 	0
To conclude , smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior . 	1
All in all , the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture . 	1
If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated . 	0
Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs . 	0
Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination . 	0
While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working . 	0
They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it . 	0
One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 . 	0
The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society . 	0
When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country . 	0
It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . 	0
First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . 	0
This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . 	0
For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . 	0
Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . 	0
Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places 	0
In this case , I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health . 	1
However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . 	0
As a result , people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world . 	1
Travelling , social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car . 	1
For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . 	0
If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future . 	0
Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments . 	1
To conclude , I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments . 	1
For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	0
In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . 	0
It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
Creative Artists 	0
One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
It ' s all the same in every profession . 	0
As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment . 	0
First of all , a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career . 	0
From my prospect , I believe that they do deserve this high payment . 	1
They are not paid for no reason . 	0
Therefore , those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways . 	1
Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine . 	0
Should we pay professional athletes ( entertainers ) a high salary ? 	0
This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money ? 	0
Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this . 	0
They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses . 	0
Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts . 	1
It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students . 	0
Students take a break of year or two , some students travel all around the world during this time , and some choose to take up a job . 	0
Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea 	0
Nowadays , it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies . 	0
Student ' s who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies . 	0
Experience gained through traveling to different places , meeting different people and even at job goes long way . 	1
It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent . 	0
As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
Commuincation can bring many benefits . 	0
It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication . 	0
Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers . 	0
For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal . 	0
In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits . 	1
To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . 	0
There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . 	0
Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . 	0
For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . 	0
Therefore , I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles . 	1
Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run . 	0
They argue that people , especially youngsters , are crazier about fresh and advanced things , such as digital products , thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques . 	0
But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years . 	0
In fact , many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture . 	0
On the other hand , some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles . 	1
Additionally , technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage , making it more vivid and appealing . 	1
For example , China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo , using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods , such as robots and LED screens . 	0
As a result , rarely do people go out of their comfot zone , provided with snack and air conditioner , to assemble with others in flesh . 	1
Needless to say , their action will make a beeline for obesity , short-sighted , diabetes and other heart-related problems . 	0
In conclusion , despite the contribution of IT to the society , its effect on the users ' independence and prositution should not be out of concern . 	1
Human activities are harming the Earth 	0
Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . 	1
Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . 	0
This will address students ' interests because it ' s the assignment that needs real life participation . 	0
For example , in law class , students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them . 	0
When any one of the situations occurs , they can think independently and figure out how to react . 	0
In conclusion , using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students ' attention and keep them eager on learning , not only because it reinforces students ' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own . 	1
This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study . 	1
For example , suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family . 	0
If you would like to attend a business school , you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university . 	0
He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community ' s university . 	0
More wastes have to be managed . 	0
Maybe crime rate will also increase . 	0
Traffic may worsen . 	0
However , building the university may lead to some social problems . 	1
This can also help stimulate the local economy . 	1
These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community . 	0
In sum , I myself agree with the plan to build the university . 	1
Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	0
Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . 	0
Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . 	0
For example in relationships . 	0
Firstly , people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time , which leads to numerous advantages . 	0
From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city . 	0
Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . 	1
Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	1
Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . 	1
Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . 	0
In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . 	0
As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . 	0
Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	0
I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons . 	0
Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . 	1
Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self-study , depends on our teachers a lot . 	0
There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers . 	1
Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life 	0
Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . 	0
Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle . 	1
Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life . 	0
People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time 	0
Generally speaking , I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life , for several reasons . 	1
Many people own cars and use them daily , which clearly shows how important they are . 	0
Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today . 	0
I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away . 	0
Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love . 	1
Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . 	0
As a result , I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal . 	1
Beside , I could express my personal thought through telephones and email . 	0
Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . 	1
Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . 	0
So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . 	0
For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . 	0
Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching , while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing . 	0
In my opinion , I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school . 	1
How teachers can make the subject interesting to students ! 	0
First of all , by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life , students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject . 	1
Take chemistry for example , merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring , while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class . 	0
Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones , resulting in their dependence on technical equipment . 	0
What is more , the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict , therefore , staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative . 	0
With the rapid developing pace , IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves . 	1
In the past , there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail , but the cyber world now varies form games , online TV shows to means of communication , and probably still keeps going . 	0
However , it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental . 	0
In my opinion , there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense . 	1
Future information technology : positive or negative ? 	0
The appearance of information technology ( IT ) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency . 	0
This is because they are doing what they love , their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths . 	0
It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries , for example , will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably . 	0
More specifically , people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family ' s living needs such as food , clothes , accommodation , education , medication . 	1
On one hand , i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human ' basic needs . 	0
In the following paragraphs , some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively . 	0
I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job . 	1
Along with the increasing physical demands of human life , salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone . 	0
Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job 	0
There are plenty of people , who are now really successful , have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers , dancers and painters . 	0
On the other hand , i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working , we are likely to achieve success easily in that field . 	1
In conclusion , I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people ' s interaction , because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships . 	1
In this way , technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships . 	1
Also , they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet . 	0
In the past , people might have had pen friends in other countries , but now , thanks to the social networking websites , people can easily to find someone who has similar interests . 	0
As for me , I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country . 	1
Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted . 	0
As far as I am concerned , both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages . 	1
On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . 	0
Dormitory or apartment ? 	0
When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . 	0
For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . 	0
Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . 	0
A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering . 	0
Popular events are essential 	0
Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased . 	0
These emotions are shared locally in our village or city , nationally in our own country but even internationally too . 	0
The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team . 	0
As a matter of fact , world sport events provide positive waves for number of people . 	1
Computers have made humans over-dependent . 	1
However , everything has pros and cons . 	0
There is no end to the evolution of computers . 	0
Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on . 	0
Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright . 	1
Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it . 	1
For example , now there are more chances to do business with people around the world , so besides one ' s own profession , language ability is essential as well . 	0
For another example , financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century , thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management . 	0
However , as those industries expand and become internationalized , people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges . 	0
This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life . 	0
Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	0
Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . 	0
I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten . 	1
This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . 	0
Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . 	0
To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . 	1
Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . 	0
Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten 	0
However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . 	0
Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school . 	0
Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . 	1
It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them . 	0
They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences . 	0
In conclusion , challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation , whether in career or in self-identification . 	1
It is hard to judge which generation ' s problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation , there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters . 	1
Second , this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation . 	1
The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them . 	0
By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
This means , there will be children , grandparents , as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants . 	0
Secondly , restaurants are places that people usually come with their families . 	0
They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them . 	0
Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals . 	1
First of all , restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals . 	0
In my opinion , smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably . 	1
Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively , those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human ' s body . 	0
There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human ' s body . 	0
Generally speaking , smoking is never been good for human ' s body . 	0
Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants 	0
Last but not least , language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world . 	0
In addition , forming a language must be undergone thousands of years ; thus , it deserves to be respected and preserved . 	0
For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . 	0
Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . 	1
We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance . 	1
From my point of view although appearance is important , personality is the most important . 	1
Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . 	0
Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look 	0
For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . 	0
First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . 	1
I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes . 	0
Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . 	0
Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . 	0
If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . 	0
Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . 	1
In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . 	0
Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . 	1
Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . 	1
Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	0
Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . 	1
Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . 	0
We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . 	0
We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . 	0
I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	0
Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . 	1
It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . 	0
You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . 	0
In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage . 	0
As the Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ’ s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions . 	0
For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species . 	0
International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide . 	0
While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries , I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations . 	0
Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits . 	0
This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism . 	0
Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries . 	1
Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals . 	0
For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . 	0
In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . 	0
Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . 	0
They are being rude towards others . 	0
A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues 	0
Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . 	0
First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . 	1
Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . 	0
Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . 	0
Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following . 	0
One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation . 	0
As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job . 	1
In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them . 	0
This can be done in school . 	0
For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job . 	0
If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future . 	0
I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations . 	0
The ability to relate well to people is more important 	0
I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons : We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job . 	1
We should consider many factors and choose the best of them . 	0
Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process . 	1
Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly . 	0
It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future . 	0
Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast . 	0
They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on . 	0
Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed . 	0
The whole world is dependent on computers , without which , the world will go back hundreds of years . 	1
Computers - use , future prospects and over-dependence 	0
To sum up , I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations . 	1
It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment , giving us awesome performances to enjoy . 	1
In conclusion , high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances . 	1
Second , such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete ' s great performances . 	1
That ' s why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields , namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods . 	0
They shall reap within their high salaries . 	0
Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they ' ve gone through and how much cost they ' ve thrown into investing themselves . 	0
Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair . 	1
In other words , if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances , there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed . 	0
Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone , but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment . 	0
However , in my opinion , as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his / her dreams and careers , that would be fair . 	0
Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace . 	0
The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime . 	0
The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields . 	0
To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds . 	1
Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning . 	1
There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide . 	0
Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life . 	0
Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly ? 	0
From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress . 	1
In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances . 	0
Finally one night , having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car , he crashed a truck and died . 	0
Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property , but also bring sorry to his family . 	0
I found that I should manage the way that I spend money . 	0
From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted . 	0
Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family . 	0
If parents get the children all they wanted , they would be run out of their money for their essential needs . 	0
Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money , when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity . 	1
As a case in point , I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family , his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood . 	0
He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money . 	0
His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life , but unfortunately it was useless . 	0
The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture . 	0
When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures . 	0
On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs . 	1
On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination . 	1
As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country . 	0
Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual , full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture . 	0
To picture it , recently , Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries , but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn ' t listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea . 	0
After the Olympics games are finished , everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority . 	0
In other words , this is the " calm before the storm " . 	0
Thus , if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal , the reality is different . 	0
These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs . 	1
Finally , an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people , let them dream , being proud of their nationality and forget problems , but just for a while . 	1
When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one . 	0
Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not ? 	0
Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue . 	0
Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc . For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job . 	1
These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful . 	0
In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds . 	1
Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast . 	1
World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology , however , there are some negative aspects . 	0
Decade after decade , every day , scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT , such as interactive boards , multicore computers and laptops , tablets , which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones , which have the power of a computer . 	0
There have been significant developments in the field of IT ! 	0
All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth . 	1
Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them . 	0
This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good . 	0
Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility 	0
In addition , cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home . 	1
Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship . 	0
My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money . 	0
Furthermore , they are more flexible . 	0
If he had no car , he wouldn ' t be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms . 	0
He used his car to drive to the other end of the country , worked there during the week and came home for the weekend . 	0
If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life . 	0
Finally , the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world . 	0
There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car . 	0
They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas . 	0
So , relating well to people is also another important factor . 	1
As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . 	0
Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	0
Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . 	1
The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . 	0
There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . 	0
Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons . 	1
To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
Establishing a new university in your community 	0
I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community . 	1
There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies , creation of jobs . 	1
However , they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems . 	0
Undoubtedly , the university will have to hire professors , employees and etc . Thus , a number vacant positions need to be filled . 	0
Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community . 	0
I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget , even though now I ' m not studying chemistry anymore . 	0
Second , by bridging the theories with daily life events , students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving . 	1
Furthermore , temporarily targets should be set , with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time , for example , a season . 	0
Primarily , authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities , such as constructing more bus lines , in order to reducing the usage of private cars . 	0
Meanwhile , cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out , though it might not be into effect immediately , but in the long run , it would be a wise choice . 	0
Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems . 	0
In conclusion , addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate , while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable , plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised . 	1
On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . 	1
For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co-operative compared to living in university dormitories . 	0
In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . 	0
I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students . 	1
However , it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first . 	0
I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost . 	1
There are many advantage of these invention , telephones and email . 	0
Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required 	0
I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication , telephones and email , made people less personal . 	1
Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier . 	1
To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . 	1
I will give several reasons to support my opinion . 	0
I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . 	0
Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . 	0
Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . 	0
For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . 	0
After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	0
To my mind , there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual ' s life . 	1
Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance . 	0
Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . 	0
" Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " 	0
Capital punishment ; 51% countries have polished death penalty 	0
In the whole world , 51% countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98% in Europe . 	0
In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . 	0
However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . 	0
Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . 	0
Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . 	0
Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons . 	1
The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . 	0
Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . 	0
In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . 	0
In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . 	0
It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . 	1
Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . 	0
I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children . 	1
In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . 	0
Computers expose children to vulgar materials . 	0
Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc . are some of its demerits , from a countless list . 	0
Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels . 	0
From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm . 	0
As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family . 	0
There are many ways of teaching . 	0
While I was in senior high school , my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas . 	0
Once student ' s starts earning , they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence . 	0
They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment . 	0
There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education . 	0
Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education , which will help them to get a better job and salaries . 	0
This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs , one needs a proper and higher qualification . 	0
In my view point , I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education . 	1
Students who take break , gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working . 	1
They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature . 	0
To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . 	0
We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . 	0
Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . 	0
Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . 	0
Pets have always been essential in our society . 	0
Our useful friends 	0
Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . 	0
First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . 	1
The issue is controversial but in my opinion , pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons . 	1
However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . 	0
many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood . 	0
One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility , specially in financially matters . 	0
So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues . 	1
To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood , when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked . 	0
The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life , even though when we are not borne . 	0
Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . 	1
If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate . 	1
This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help . 	1
Each makes different decisions . 	0
Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . 	0
Living with a roommate is better than Living alone 	0
Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . 	0
This means you can get more for less . 	0
For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . 	0
Moreover , if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit , they will produce products with low qualities and high prices , therefore they might hit consumer ' s life . 	1
For instance , a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk , sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die . 	0
Firstly , if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want , they will threaten the beings ' life such as human , animals and plants . 	1
As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances . 	0
However , I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit . 	1
With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit . 	1
Businesses should be only concerned about making profits . 	0
There is no doubt that companies , factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people ' s need and make a profit for their managers . 	0
In conclusion , all companies , factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive , and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit . 	1
They can hit both the environment and human ' s life easily . 	1
In conclusion , i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one . 	1
As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	0
I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences . 	1
For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	0
In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . 	0
large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . 	1
Third , I love travelling around the world . 	0
Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility ? 	0
First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished . 	0
I asked my father for extra money , but he refuse to give it to me . 	0
Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues . 	0
" Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . 	0
The existence of Skype , Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click . 	0
More , even if family members who are in different countries , they also can use the Internet to connect each others , especially though the images or videos , they can feel close . 	0
Instead of using letters , technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient . 	0
While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions . 	0
The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely . 	1
However , I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people . 	1
As technology develops , it has negative influences in many respects . 	0
Nowadays , the variety of communication systems used widely . 	0
Man to man interaction changed 	0
Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology , technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network . 	0
Furthermore , technology is also essential for students , live in remote districts , shared the valuable natural resources with friends . 	0
Personally speaking , it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one . 	1
Stroke , heart disorders , hearing loss , and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers . 	0
When they are around the active smokers , they will inhale hazardous smoke . 	0
Last but not least , passive smokers will have a lot of health risks . 	0
The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies . 	0
Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders ' health , especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs . 	1
Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something . 	0
Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children . 	1
State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant ' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals . 	0
In conclusion , smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged . 	1
In contrast , young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually . 	1
They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want . 	0
They do not undergo any pain or misery . 	0
Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? 	0
As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . 	0
Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . 	0
Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	0
To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society . 	1
The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty . 	1
For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	0
To conclude , I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers . 	1
I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . 	1
For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	0
The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . 	0
Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . 	1
Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . 	0
Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . 	0
Some people prefer to work for a large company 	0
I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons . 	1
Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . 	0
Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . 	0
First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . 	1
In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	0
For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . 	0
