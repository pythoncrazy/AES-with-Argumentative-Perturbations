Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings . 	0
Therefore , managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation . 	1
In my opinion , all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved . 	1
There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings . 	0
Old buildings should be preserved 	0
The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture . 	0
Besides that , the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values . 	0
Old buildings are an essential part of history . 	0
As a result of the rapid urbanization process , in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities , the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing . 	0
Because of that need , governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings . 	1
In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations , the male and the female or the baby and the adult . 	0
If you visit the zoo , you get to watch the animals , their customs , what they eat and how they eat it , as well as which characteristics the different species have . 	0
We can learn a lot from books and lectures , but there is an even better way to learn , that is visuals and personal experience . 	0
Animals , the different species , their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities . 	0
Finally , a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone ' s respect and appreciation for animals . 	1
Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school . 	1
Moreover , it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous . 	0
It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations , such as weather , specie and genre interaction , defense behavior , or protection of their babies . 	0
This is especially true for people living in the city , where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs . 	0
It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it , and learned from it . 	0
Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . 	1
It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . 	0
On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . 	0
Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear . 	1
It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . 	0
Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? 	0
First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . 	0
On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . 	1
However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	0
Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . 	1
Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this . 	0
Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn . 	0
Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives 	0
Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society . 	0
Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits . 	1
For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans . 	0
First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more . 	0
Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits . 	1
From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support . 	0
However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts . 	0
Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today ' s market . 	0
Also , overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases , especially cough , sneezing and illness . 	0
Life in Big Cities Vs People ' s health 	0
Today , more and more people are moving to big cities to live . 	0
However , while life in those cities is good in some ways , I completely argue that people ' s health would therefore be affected negatively . 	1
Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before . 	1
Exhaust from transportation , especially cars , and factories ' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases . 	0
Besides , water pollution makes people ' s health become more critical . 	0
The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people ' s bodies and create severe problems , which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time . 	0
Moreover , it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink . 	1
They are essential to our spiritual life . 	0
They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way . 	0
Second , music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing . 	0
Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination . 	0
If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much . 	0
In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like . 	0
However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them . 	1
Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure . 	1
In this way , it will not be such pressure on children . 	0
In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills . 	0
Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives . 	1
In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination . 	0
In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days . 	0
It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults . 	1
Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most . 	1
There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . 	0
Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . 	0
Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . 	1
Consequently , the calm atmosphere in the class might be created . 	0
In fact , students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music . 	0
Moreover , if musical activity involves many participants , there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group , which is , of course , beneficial in their future life . 	0
In this case , music can be a useful and interesting solution . 	0
I have an impression that students , who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time . 	0
Therefore , many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music . 	1
It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology . 	0
In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides . 	0
Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject , while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional . 	0
Should high school make music lessons compulsory 	0
Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete . 	0
The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country . 	0
They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
Gender Equality at university admission 	0
Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . 	0
Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities . 	1
From all analysis suggested above , professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions . 	1
I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation . 	0
Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . 	0
It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . 	0
While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . 	0
They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . 	0
Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly , rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future . 	0
This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual . 	1
Thus to conclude , it can be said that when young people follow celebrities , it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way . 	1
So , this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people . 	1
For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools . 	0
Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior . 	0
Roles of international sports events 	0
Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world . 	0
As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely . 	1
In this case , the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company . 	0
Secondly , employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained . 	1
Clearly , in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer , complaining from boss , etc . Therefore , we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends , joking in class , enjoying new knowledge . 	1
Firstly , training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind . 	0
My arguments for this point are listed follows . 	0
Besides the methods , from my point of view , providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work . 	0
Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways 	0
For another thing , employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don ' t have this opportunity . 	0
So obviously , they will think about develop long term career with their company . 	0
Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
Nonetheless , its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity . 	1
In conclusion , I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization . 	1
We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life . 	1
This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously . 	0
Last but not least , technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements . 	1
It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . 	0
First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . 	0
Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . 	0
Study at school or get a job ? 	0
Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school . 	1
Another debatable problem is about techniques . 	0
It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers , although the further investigation are needed . 	0
This possibility exists all the time . 	0
There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party . 	1
Moreover , the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people ' s daily life . 	1
But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users . 	0
In conclusion , nothing can be overused without side effects . 	0
Not only used for communication , but it also functions as an Internet browser , a music player , a personal organizer and so forth . 	0
The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people ' s dependence on it is irreversible , although it has a number of problems that should be well handled . 	1
Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . 	0
Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . 	0
Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . 	0
For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	0
Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . 	1
Therefore , it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens ' tax funds to meet a minority of people ' s needs . 	0
For example , not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot . 	0
Furthermore , putting taxpayers ' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them . 	0
Instead , the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits , which deserves more funds from government . 	0
To summarize , I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities , because the former is more essential , non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens . 	1
That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support , because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis . 	1
In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents . 	0
Should we require our young children to learn music and art 	0
Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules . 	0
Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination . 	0
First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young . 	1
In my opinion , I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them . 	1
However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled . 	0
Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many . 	1
Looking from another perspective , written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages . 	1
With only pictures , everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images . 	0
Nonetheless , this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about . 	0
Furthermore , the primary way of educating students is also by this way . 	0
Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better . 	0
To conclude , both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect , either images or words . 	1
Hence , for a more meaningful communication , these two elements have their respective roles to play : image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject . 	0
When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . 	0
For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . 	0
To avoid being a pessimist , we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families , doing exercise regularly , and trying to see our troubles in a different way . 	0
Consequently , it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body . 	1
Moreover , some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world . 	0
" Blood diamond " , an adaptation of a real story in South Africa , focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict . 	0
The movie is humorous and satiric , which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives , and it reminds us how important our families are . 	0
Thus , the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves . 	1
As a result , serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way . 	1
For the above reasons , I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives . 	1
After watching the movie , we may learn a lesson between jewels and death . 	0
Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love ; indeed , the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality . 	0
It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically . 	0
Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit . 	0
Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus 	0
While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that . 	1
To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects . 	0
If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health . 	0
For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes . 	0
Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability . 	1
As you can see , if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen . 	0
The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries . 	0
Instead of this , some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution . 	0
Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . 	0
In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . 	0
Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . 	1
In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . 	0
For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . 	0
They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . 	0
When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . 	1
I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features , getting help from other students , improving my attitude for learning , managing my time in an effective way . 	1
When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates , I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again . 	0
Studying alone or in a group 	0
They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . 	0
In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . 	0
First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . 	1
For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . 	0
However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . 	0
I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields . 	1
Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ? 	0
Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . 	0
Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts . 	0
However , their talents should not be overrated . 	0
We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . 	0
Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
First of all , when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure , therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes . 	1
For instance , most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats , but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems . 	0
Second of all , experience shows while people doing a job constantly , they become more experienced in that subject , so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile . 	1
For example , scientists experiment a substance for a long time , after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final . 	0
The expression " Never , never give up " means keep trying and never stop working 	0
Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education , love and economy . 	0
Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that ; however , I completely disagree with this idea . 	0
I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal . 	1
To sum up , I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure . 	1
In opposite , they have to learn new points from that failure , and they become more experienced . 	1
In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions . 	0
When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life . 	0
They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . 	0
Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . 	0
Overall , I believe that students should study at school . 	1
Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	0
There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job . 	0
Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job , studying at school is always the best choice for children ' s future . 	1
Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . 	0
If you did , it was probably at a zoo . 	0
Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey ? 	0
Zoos have no useful purpose ? 	0
In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals , play with some of them , comment on their appearance and behavior , and laugh at their funny customs . 	0
When people visit the zoo , they normally do it in a group , with their families , or as a part of a school group activity . 	0
I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction , education , and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding . 	1
A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose . 	0
The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family , it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member , from little children to grandparents . 	1
Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago . 	0
Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups . 	1
After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . 	0
We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . 	0
Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . 	1
As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . 	0
By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . 	0
During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives . 	0
Why are groups or organizations important to people ? 	0
My reasons include the following : In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups . 	0
In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals . 	1
As a result , if we don ' t have a good stress management skill , it may lead to some critical problems . 	1
Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
Now , it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams . 	0
I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills , also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying . 	1
Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . 	1
Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . 	0
When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . 	0
Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . 	0
Mobile phones , such as smart phones , has made our communication easy and convenience . 	0
However , we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints . 	0
Thus , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication . 	1
The reason is that , as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones , people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge . 	0
Therefore , i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems . 	0
To sum up , although mobile phones make our communication faster , it also gives rise to many social problems such as children ' s social skills and their mental health . 	1
On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . 	1
For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . 	0
If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	0
In conclusion , the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment . 	1
However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure . 	0
Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities . 	0
Children engagement in paid work 	0
Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving . 	1
First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money . 	0
From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties . 	0
Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working . 	1
Higher education should be available only to good students or not 	0
No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone . 	0
College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal . 	0
There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university . 	0
This issue will be discussed . 	0
First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . 	1
The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . 	0
College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . 	0
They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . 	0
Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . 	0
Thus , the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation . 	0
University education is always an important part of one ' s life . 	0
Consequently , frequent conflicts may occur during communication . 	0
In these games , children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players , and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviors . 	0
Taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work . 	1
Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy , focus on work . 	0
In conclusion , providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages . 	1
Of course , excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss . 	0
Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business , so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result . 	0
Thirdly , providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge . 	1
Also , they do not have to educate and they do not have to work , so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life . 	1
In addition , in this age they are not expected to be responsible . 	1
As much as their events might were bitter , in their adulthood they are sweet . 	0
When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events . 	0
You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood . 	0
Children are free 	0
Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them . 	1
Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs . 	0
In the first place , children are free whatever they want to do , they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare . 	0
In my opinion , childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas . 	1
In my opinion , by charging private individuals for causing air pollution , that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution . 	1
On the other hand , I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies . 	1
Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air , instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals . 	1
In conclusion , due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution , both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution . 	1
Some people regard stress as a power , which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best ; other people cannot charge of their thoughts , emotions , and the way they deal with problems . 	0
In the frenetic , fast-paced world , it is a very common predicament that all of us , from the young to the senior , feel depressed caused by stress , such as financial problems , exam stress , relationship difficulties and work overload . 	0
To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge . 	0
The professors ’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses . 	0
In conclusion , I think that in order to be a competitive worker , students must know their field in an advanced level . 	0
To my mind , students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects , rather than playing on guitar or singing a song . 	0
Nowadays , time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace . 	0
Therefore , music and other entertaining subjects should be optional . 	1
Increasingly however , students can not obtain supposed impacts , unless they get interested in it more seriously . 	0
Hence , I agree with the majority , because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it . 	0
In our hectic life , however , demand is not for musically orientated students , but for academically developed employees . 	0
By contrast , it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students . 	0
There won ' t be any effect if school does so . 	0
There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country . 	0
However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents . 	0
Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills . 	0
Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life . 	1
Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development . 	1
Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects . 	1
As a result of mental immaturity , most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong . 	0
However , in order to tackle this problem more effectively , governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children ’ s television programs . 	0
Admittedly , reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could , to some degree , decrease the overall crime rate . 	0
Personally , I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids , while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable . 	1
Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today . 	0
Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society . 	0
Large amount of violence in television programs 	0
Nevertheless , it would certainly be a violation of adults ’ civil liberties , if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences . 	1
Therefore , it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies . 	1
Consequently , conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent . 	0
In other word , professor should concern about preparing class . 	1
Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field . 	1
However , the precondition of doing research is growing students ’ solid theory fundamental . 	0
And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions . 	0
They can manage the electric theory in practical skills . 	0
This is requires professors provide high quality courses . 	0
However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research . 	0
Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way . 	1
In the following paragraphs , both sides of the above matter as well as my own view ' s explanations would be analyzed and given , respectively . 	0
Firstly , it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently , human life has been improved dramatically . 	1
Air-conditioners , computers , cellphones , washing machines , for example , is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities . 	0
Moreover , applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients ' lives . 	0
Negative effects of technological process 	0
It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy . 	0
Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives . 	0
I personally disagree with this view . 	0
However , some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly . 	0
In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process . 	1
First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
University education is needed for success 	0
I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	1
This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers . 	1
The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . 	0
Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . 	0
It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis . 	1
Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects 	0
In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . 	0
I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution . 	1
First , in most industrialized countries , there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions . 	0
Air pollution 	0
Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way . 	0
If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution , they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause . 	1
Second , private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating . 	0
The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution . 	0
While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses , most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution . 	0
For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks . 	0
They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . 	0
A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . 	0
By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose . 	1
When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term . 	0
For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year . 	0
Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal . 	1
Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job . 	0
Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . 	0
Here is an example : there are various charities in the world . 	0
It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . 	0
This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	1
There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . 	0
Personally , I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment , but we need to analyze some specific situations . 	1
The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great 	0
Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . 	0
However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	0
Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . 	0
On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . 	1
For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . 	0
Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success . 	0
In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people . 	0
High-salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money . 	0
This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly . 	0
To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate . 	1
Besides , the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better . 	0
Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? 	0
In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? 	0
Furthermore , stress takes a toll on our health . 	0
Therefore , stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization . 	1
This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress . 	0
It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles , frustrations , and demands . 	0
Melancholia , the most fatal problem , even leads some people to commit suicide . 	0
Thus , some people have physical problems , such as insomnia and headaches . 	0
From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	1
Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children . 	1
For the above reasons , I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress . 	1
Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people . 	1
Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results . 	0
Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses . 	1
In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad . 	1
Thus , the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported . 	1
In conclusion , it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency ; however , the adults should not be the victim of this policy . 	1
Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors , they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them . 	0
For whom , such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment . 	0
Frequently , adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day . 	0
The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities . 	1
This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos . 	0
In the present there is a lack of respect for animals . 	0
Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve . 	0
It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions , but regardless of the condition , zoos are very useful . 	1
Earning money for living becomes more difficult , living healthy in such places is getting harder also . 	1
In conclusion , I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people ' s health . 	1
Furthermore , living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas . 	1
Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary , pickpocketing , trickery , vandalism , smuggling or even murder . 	0
Thus , both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved . 	0
During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute . 	0
At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary . 	0
Keep trying and never stop working for your goals 	0
" Keep running ! , " shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move . 	0
Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth . 	1
For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard . 	0
I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty . 	0
From this experience , I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals . 	1
Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running . 	0
Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger . 	1
As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society . 	0
Recently , some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities . 	1
How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public . 	0
Government shouldn ' t put money on building theaters or sports stadiums 	0
Entertaining facilities such as cinemas , theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented . 	1
Therefore , providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government . 	1
As a matter of fact , an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals , whereas a physical damaged person , resulting from the lack of medical treatment , may no longer participate in any sports games . 	0
Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums . 	0
The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market , which should not be interfered by government . 	0
Their existences are based on their marketing strategies , the condition of facilities and the volume of audience . 	0
So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers . 	1
For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost . 	0
I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour . 	0
In conclusion , young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage . 	1
Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life . 	1
Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success . 	0
Stress , our body ' s way of responding to any kind of demand , can be caused by both good and bad experiences . 	0
However , it is widely thought that we experience stress any time , which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals . 	0
Some people think that life is a struggle , which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives . 	0
What is a very important skill a person should learn 	0
Here are my reasons . 	0
Accordingly , stress management , how to survive our unbearable stress , is the most important skill that we should have . 	1
Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects . 	1
Thus , to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life , to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path , it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
In a nutshell , I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own . 	1
It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs . 	0
However , I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have . 	0
It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night , smoke or do drugs . 	0
Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own , and thus missing the valuable input of their parents . 	0
While some critics may argue that , young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want . 	1
In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . 	0
Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful . 	0
An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory . 	1
On the other hand , music can help an individual to shape its character . 	1
This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages , ideas , or opinions to people . 	0
Nevertheless , the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used . 	0
Is image more powerful than the written word ? 	0
" A picture is worth a thousand words " is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time . 	0
For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . 	0
As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . 	0
Hence , I agree only to certain degree that in today ' s world , image serves as a more effective means of communication . 	1
Firstly , pictures can influence the way people think . 	1
Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . 	0
Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . 	0
They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment , but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them . 	1
All in all , I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood . 	1
Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . 	0
Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . 	0
I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life . 	1
Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life 	0
Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . 	0
It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think . 	1
Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . 	0
Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult . 	0
But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . 	1
I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively . 	0
By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment . 	0
A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer . 	0
Thus , students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning . 	0
That is to say , students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve . 	0
In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby . 	0
For me , I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment . 	0
It ' s unpleasant to stay at school . 	0
However , coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly . 	0
That ' s why education in university is discussed all the time . 	0
What is the best way to orientate the students ? 	0
I ' m against providing more money to professors 	0
The professors are essential , however , the schools are established for students . 	1
Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources , which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors . 	1
Raising the salaries of professors so ? 	0
I would say no . 	0
The following are my opinions . 	0
To begin with , the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors . 	1
Little wonder , then , that by watching these violent TV programs and videos , juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes . 	0
In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture . 	1
For instance , there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature . 	0
Furthermore , the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development . 	1
For example , as people , especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones , they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends , and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills . 	0
In the first place , spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills . 	0
As a result , it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently . 	1
Moreover , continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children ' s eyesight and physical posture . 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life . 	0
Mobile phones : faster communication vs social problems 	0
However , I believe , this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society . 	1
Indeed , mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages . 	0
For example , in a survey carried out in a university , it was asked to students that why did they start smoking , then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes . 	0
Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age . 	0
First of all , it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents . 	1
This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors . 	0
It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth . 	1
These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles . 	0
Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities . 	0
Effect of celebrities on youth 	0
Secondly , it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way . 	0
This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals . 	0
Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . 	0
With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . 	0
On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . 	0
Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . 	0
Students can have opportunity to learn , to practice , to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future . 	1
Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have . 	1
Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university . 	1
In conclusion , I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal . 	1
First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries . 	1
Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures . 	0
Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations . 	1
After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations . 	0
Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators . 	0
That ' s the main reason I against providing more money to professors . 	1
Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition . 	0
At school , students are priority . 	0
Students ' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university . 	1
These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age . 	0
As a matter of fact , I made a large number of friends in this age , and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten . 	0
But people should be careful with what they eat , because some industrial foods are very bad for their health , so they should buy only food from well known brands . 	1
All in all , that ease to prepare food has improved people ’ s lives . 	1
And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology . 	0
For example , if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend , he could just buy some food that comes with instructions . 	0
Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time . 	0
Living on your own is a huge financial commitment . 	0
At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job , so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent , food , utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself . 	0
So , I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income . 	1
Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them . 	1
Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out 	0
As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own . 	0
But , the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one . 	0
Personally , I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time . 	1
Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life . 	0
Living together develops the environment of discussing adult ' s physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents . 	0
In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible . 	1
However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way . 	0
Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . 	0
As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . 	0
It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . 	0
Some students enjoy taking part in some research . 	0
Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . 	0
Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . 	1
Mobile phones are not out of expectation . 	0
First of all , almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems . 	1
What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other . 	0
Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas , such as schools , libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive . 	0
Nowadays , the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well , such as social , medical and technical problems . 	0
Effects of mobile phones 	0
In this essay , I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint . 	0
However , I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones . 	1
Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances . 	0
They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched . 	0

Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field , the research takes up too much teaching time . 	1
As far as I am concerned , professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research . 	1
The precondition of doing research by professors 	0
Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities . 	0
If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes . 	0
The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies . 	0
In this way , professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students . 	0
Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research . 	1
Finally , human need some crucial things to continue their life , and most of them are industrial such as medicine . 	0
Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable . 	0
We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn , and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks . 	0
Firstly , day by day population is increasing , so human needs for food is increasing as well . 	0
Secondly , people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals , so they need land to build their houses on it . 	1
Therefore , farmlands are vital for human life . 	1
Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that . 	0
Some people think that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more 	0
From my point of view although endangered animals are important , human needs should be considered more . 	1
Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals . 	0
Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future . 	0
People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President . 	0
The eager atmosphere lasted many next days . 	0
When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness . 	0
For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets . 	0
Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen . 	1
In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely . 	1
In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally . 	0

I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line . 	0
However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself . 	0
I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger . 	0
Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on . 	0
I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying . 	1
When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself . 	0
He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal . 	0
For these reasons , I agree that one should not give up , as the true reward is to have the dignity . 	1
Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life . 	1
For example , if an engineer needs to make a project , but he needs to deliver it tomorrow , he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch . 	0
Secondly , when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason , some time ago he / she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food , but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food . 	1
Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook . 	0
Firstly , people normally have lots of things to do . 	0
Because of that , they don ’ t have much time to spend in the kitchen . 	0
But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome . 	1
Easy preparation of food leads to a better life 	0
The Technology has developed a lot . 	0
With that development , food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to . 	0
With that change , people ’ s lives are a lot better for several reasons . 	0
Furthermore , the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them . 	0
Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there . 	1
. 	0
Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty , and that preservation help to finish half of work . 	1
Overall , both of those view have strong arguments : the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism . 	0
So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them . 	1
Second , not all of serious movies are boring . 	0
" Click " is a very interesting comedy , with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses . 	0
Serious or entertaining movies 	0
I prefer the serious movies which are simple , touching and powerful . 	1
Here are my reasons . 	0
First , most serious movies have a wide variety of content . 	1
Entertaining movies are created to amuse people . 	0
However , most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical . 	0
Compared with the entertainment film , the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful . 	0
Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love , humaneness ; moreover , it may point out the dark sides of the society . 	0
To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities . 	0
Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline . 	0
Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study . 	0
In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects . 	0
It is adverse to the whole academic field . 	0
Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research . 	1
Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research . 	0
For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car . 	0
Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry . 	0
Therefore , some lands should be assigned to industry . 	1
I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland , housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	1
To conclude , the population of endangered animals are less than people ' s population , so they do not need so much land that people need . 	1
As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world . 	0
For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds . 	1
