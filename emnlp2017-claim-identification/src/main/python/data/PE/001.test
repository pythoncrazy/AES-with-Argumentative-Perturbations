For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school . 	1
To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
In March 2003 , a lab technician shot a video inside a lab , which revealed primates in cages without pain medication , for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head . 	0
Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly , which influences their reactions to drugs . 	0
Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances , while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else . 	0
Which one is the promising way to succeed ? 	0
As living in a competent world , we are like playing a survival game . 	0
Consideration is always important in relationship . 	0
In the meantime , communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate . 	1
Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine . 	0
For example , roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time . 	0
Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school . 	0
Roommates quality and their importance 	0
In my personal opinion , the most important quality of roommates is being considered . 	1
Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate . 	0
Therefore , having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life . 	1
At all times , think about the other ' s feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously . 	0
If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution . 	0
Additionally , it might put strain on the environment . 	0
In my opinion , however , I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment . 	1
In conclusion , young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials . 	1
Secondly , animals are kept in unnatural conditions . 	0
Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money , since they must be fed , cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances . 	0
Every year , cosmetic companies , farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products , without any beneficial result . 	0
Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals ' rights today is animal experimentation . 	0
For example , if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn ' t do it , but his father told him / her that it was right , the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person , even if his father is wrong . 	0
More power than any friend or other adult could have . 	0
They have more contact and more intimacy with their children . 	0
Secondly , a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people , so their parents have more time to teach him / her than anybody else . 	1
I completely agree that parents are the best teacher . 	1
Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else 	0
Firstly , the things that parents say have great power to their child . 	1
Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children ’ s lives . 	1
That ’ s as important thing because even if the parents don ’ t intend to teach their children something , they are always observing and learning by themselves . 	0
Lastly , children usually mirror themselves on their parents . 	1
Moreover , parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children ' s future life . 	1
It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person . 	1
If you want to stay healthy , be yourself and spend time with your family and friends , then you should spend less time watching these media . 	0
Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements . 	0
These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images . 	1
They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies . 	0
When people are watching television or movies together , they also talk less to each other , compare to when playing social games , such as parlor games , together . 	0
When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him , then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don ’ t prefer it . 	0
I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people ’ s behavior in bad ways . 	1
When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements , they think that they are ugly . 	0
Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body . 	0
Admittedly , the government should give priority to public services and facilities . 	0
This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens , which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable . 	0
Simultaneously , public services such as education system or medical care can meet people ' s basic demand of survival , security and knowledge , thus making them feel comfortable , which can lower the crime rate . 	0
Therefore , public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability . 	1
Government should spend money on ARTs , not only on public services 	0
As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years , they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government . 	0
As a result , some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts . 	0
However , from my perspective , I think arts are supposed to be included in the government ' s investment as well . 	1
On the other hand , I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government . 	1
Individually , arts can enrich people ' s cultural lives . 	0
Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
In other words , I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face . 	1
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us . 	0
It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life 	0
Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working . 	0
From my perspective , those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date . 	0
First and foremost , various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish . 	1
Therefore , the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards . 	0
More importantly , they have activeness , inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly . 	0
These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not . 	0
Thus , easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human ' s health . 	1
Are museums necessary ? 	0
In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . 	1
However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . 	0
Third , it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children . 	0
In conclusion , parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice . 	1
Based on love , they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children ' s future life . 	0
Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers , and from my point of view it is unfair . 	0
What is more , when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves , but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager . 	1
You always have to be responsible for your task , and it make a stressful situation that I never like it . 	0
In your job you can be boss of yourself ; however , in the other jobs someone else are your boss . 	0
In the first place , there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others . 	1
There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others . 	0
Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages , I would prefer to work for myself , and have my own business . 	1
Some of them are done by companies that related to government , and some of them are done by privat companies . 	0
There are many kinds of jobs in society . 	0
Some prefer to work for a company , some prefer to work for themselves 	0
In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living . 	1
Obviously , many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career . 	0
There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities . 	0
TV has adverse effects on friends and family 	0
I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . 	0
Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority . 	1
Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . 	0
People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . 	0
Therefore , I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . 	0
Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . 	0
First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . 	1
So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . 	0
Firstly , education is an essential part in development . 	0
This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters . 	0
As I have said , television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening , but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television . 	1
For instance , most developing countries are lack of educational resources , such as experienced teachers , evaluation systems and teaching facilities , which is usually neglected by local authorities . 	0
In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience . 	0
For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . 	0
I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online . 	1
Prepared Food 	0
Nowadays , more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals , since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society . 	1
However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients , ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people ' s eating habits . 	1
In this essay , I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above . 	0
First of all , to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious , almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people . 	0
Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences . 	0
Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . 	0
This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . 	0
Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . 	1
Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	0
Honestly , I was in shock ! 	0
I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . 	0
Finally , some people make the television a priority . 	1
When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	0
People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . 	0
If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . 	0
What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction . 	1
How she could say that to me ? . 	0
And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . 	0
The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . 	0
New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government 	0
The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . 	0
Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . 	0
Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . 	0
In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
For example , I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university . 	0
Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . 	0
Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . 	0
Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . 	0
While when it comes to " happier " , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . 	0
Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . 	0
Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . 	0
To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . 	0
Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . 	1
Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . 	0
They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	0
These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . 	1
Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . 	0
Most of workers have adapted to do same task . 	0
While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job , but from my perspective , I am on the side of my father . 	0
As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . 	0
It allows us to achieve more . 	0
In my family , the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father ' s job . 	0
Different types of tasks endow more colors to our life 	0
Every time I asked him why , he will say , seriously , " I am done , doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different , that is all . " 	0
Five years ago , he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer , and became a landscape painter . 	0
Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . 	0
For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . 	0
We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . 	0
Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . 	1
If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	0
Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . 	1
Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . 	0
Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . 	0
Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	0
Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . 	1
Besides , in the far future , they become more valuable . 	0
On the other side , most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time . 	0
To conclude , there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses , but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income . 	1
Last but not least , investing in libraries has a long-time result . 	1
For example , a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers . 	0
Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time . 	0
Most libraries are free not for students also for public . 	0
Hence , universities support is vital for libraries . 	0
But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors . 	0
Also , they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets . 	0
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn . 	0
People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . 	0
The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things . 	1
As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year , it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school . 	0
Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier . 	1
Daily exercise will help also to develop children ' s brain function . 	1
In addition , exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular , higher blood and cholesterol issues . 	0
Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies , I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day . 	1
Physical exercise should be required part of every school day 	0
In addition , including exercise in children ' s daily routine , it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age . 	1
Exercise is good not only for having a good health body , but also for the mind . 	1
When people exercise , the respiratory system ' s function is enhanced , helping all organs , including the brain , to get more oxygen in . 	0
It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better . 	0
Once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success 	0
Achieving success is everybody ' s goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that once you are unique enough , you are already on the way to success . 	1
First , being positively different from everyone else usually means that you ' ve achieved something that is superior than others . 	0
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . 	0
Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . 	1
First , children are taught basic things , which influence their whole life , by their parents . 	1
Are parents best teachers ? 	0
Consequently , parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby ' s little mind . 	0
Second , parents train their child how to become a good person . 	1
As a baby , they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents . 	0
Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that . 	0
They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way . 	0
On the one hand , it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person . 	0
For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique . 	0
Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . 	0
First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
Gun control and increasing violence 	0
Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
In addition , it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world . 	0
Thus , the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid . 	0
As is commonly understood , there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries . 	0
Financial aid to develop countries 	0
However , it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries . 	1
It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries . 	0
From this example , it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education , the developing countries will remain undeveloped , even though they gain a great deal of economic support . 	1
For instance , there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases . 	0
Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition . 	1
It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food . 	0
I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees . 	1
Firstly , international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country ’ s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists . 	0
While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries , I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations . 	1
The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights , ancient heritages and different cultures around the world . 	0
International tourism is now more common than ever before 	0
Secondly , through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected . 	0
Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country . 	1
These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard . 	0
Take Cambodia for example , a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants , hotels , souvenir shops and other stores . 	0
Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works . 	0
For instance , in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely ‘ Trong Dong ’ drum performance and ‘ Ha Long ’ bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry . 	0
Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . 	1
In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study . 	0
Finally yet importantly , appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class ’ s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments . 	1
However , if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems . 	0
Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points . 	1
First and foremost , I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college . 	1
Also , they can help each other for learning materials better . 	0
On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money . 	0
However , I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option . 	1
Students should attend to classes or it should be optional ? 	0
Nowadays , it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities ( options ) as well . 	0
Television and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively 	0
There is no doubt that television or movies influence people ’ s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways . 	0
But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways . 	1
They make people to eat more rubbish food , spend less time with their friends and family , and be someone that are not themselves . 	1
There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television . 	1
Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas . 	0
It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people ’ s health . 	0
Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods . 	0
In turn , people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases . 	0
Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends , especially children . 	1
Of course , effective cooperation can make things easier and faster , but in many important cases when team-working is not possible , the ability to work alone will help . 	0
What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . 	0
There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . 	0
First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . 	0
The reasons are based on the following aspects . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . 	0
Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . 	0
Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ? 	0
Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . 	0
In conclusion , working with a group a people and working individually are all important . 	0
Both skills are necessary for a successful life . 	0
Nevertheless , the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations . 	1
Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas . 	0
Everybody in a team must have his / her own opinion first , then discuss them with other members . 	0
When we work in team , we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate . 	0
When everyone in a team can come up with his / her own ideas , working in team will definitely more effective . 	0
More convincing 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
I favor the former ; that is , I agree that face-to-face communication is better . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing . 	0
He once complained a service of a restaurant . 	0
Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it . 	0
Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication . 	0
Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . 	0
What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . 	0
For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . 	0
Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . 	1
In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects . 	1
These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects . 	0
Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable 	0
This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable , even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind . 	0
Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today ' s world in fast pace . 	0
I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today ' s world . 	1
However , it might not be the most beneficial move to our society . 	1
Primarily , even when the world operates in fast pace , it still requires accuracy . 	1
Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy . 	0
If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes , we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline . 	0
In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . 	0
It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it . 	0
Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines , traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat , laugh and cooperate face to face . 	0
As a result , communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more . 	0
Furthermore , it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today . 	1
In fact , these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children ' s skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices . 	0
By contrast , modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits . 	0
Therefore , there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival . 	0
Thus , I would conclude that traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games . 	1
Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process . 	1
For the reasons mentioned above , it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently , it should be made illegal . 	1
Take the most popular and prestigious technology company - Apple - for example . 	0
Second , being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others . 	1
In other words , once you are special and unique , pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you . 	0
In conclusion , being different and unique is the better way to achieve success . 	1
It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value , making you take the lead in your way towards success . 	1
It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers . 	0
In conclusion , there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important . 	0
Through communication , bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others . 	0
However , people might not get what they want all the time . 	0
Consideration and communication , in my personal opinion , are the most important quality . 	1
For the above reasons , if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world , we must stop by these museums . 	1
During our trip , it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place . 	1
Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . 	1
Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . 	0
As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . 	0
Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	0
Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . 	1
In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . 	0
First , I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university . 	0
All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . 	1
Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities . 	0
In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else . 	1
Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries 	0
Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success . 	0
For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities . 	0
Second , usually libraries do not have income . 	0
The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose . 	1
At the increasing living pace , the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes . 	0
Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need , especially for children who are growing up . 	0
Cooking is not a waste of time , contrarily , it is crucial for our health and culture . 	0
But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits , which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking . 	0
In conclusion , although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work , it is not a good thing . 	1
In conclusion , even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends , I think they are wrong , since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice . 	1
In light of the above-mentioned facts , one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically . 	1
To be specific , scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body , which is a miraculous breakthrough . 	0
In general , the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine . 	1
Today , even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists . 	0
The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives . 	0
These days , there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities . 	0
Young people move to cities 	0
To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas . 	0
Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this . 	0
However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . 	0
For example , if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time . 	0
As a result , cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation . 	1
There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned . 	1
Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing , including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health , I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings . 	1
Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions 	0
She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast . 	0
Thus , she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic . 	0
Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand . 	0
I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons . 	1
Firstly , the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room . 	1
However , class is not the only source of knowledge . 	0
Students also learn from other sources such as experience , libraries and other people . 	0
Attending university classes should be required or optional 	0
On the other hand , children are shown how to behave well with others . 	0
This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children ' s behavior better before they face the real world . 	0
Thus , they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children . 	0
Unlike a professional , parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life . 	0
I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual . 	1
Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals , but also misleading , since animals and people ' s response to a drug can be different . 	0
There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals . 	0
Consequently , I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity . 	1
In fact , parents ' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life . 	1
I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons . 	1
The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job , but regularly give out creative and novel ideas . 	0
What ' s more , the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge . 	0
Attending university ' s classes is one of activities that students have to do . 	0
All in all , I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child , because it can define who he is going to be . 	1
So , if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad , his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad . 	0
Also , attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success . 	1
However , the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times . 	0
Through this way , they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study . 	0
On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials . 	1
Moreover , teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it . 	1
If you don ' t make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others , you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you . 	1
Take myself for example , when I was in college , I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently . 	0
The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning . 	1
I list my reasons as follows . 	0
Classroom learnng vs online education 	0
There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . 	0
For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . 	0
Finally I got 1st rank in final exam . 	0
First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . 	1
In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . 	0
And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation . 	1
Indeed , they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas . 	0
This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market . 	0
In conclusion , financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries . 	1
Therefore , developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries . 	1
In my opinion though , social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch , the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago . 	0
The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and , thus , a happier place to live in . 	0
A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones . 	0
The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts . 	0
Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world ? 	0
Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in . 	0
Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing . 	0
I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons . 	0
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable . 	0
I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . 	0
As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power . 	1
The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle . 	0
The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy 	0
Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity . 	1
If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage . 	0
Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons . 	0
First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons . 	1
Firstly , the costs outweigh the benefits . 	0
For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
As a result , I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A + for both biology and chemistry . 	0
In conclusion , I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time . 	1
Also , they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes . 	0
So that , attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore . 	1
Finally , she got very good grade when she was graduation . 	0
Secondly , students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well . 	1
In my experience , many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes . 	0
Also , I had already studied all biology topics before attending university . 	0
In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . 	0
To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	0
Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . 	1
Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! 	0
Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . 	0
Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	1
Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . 	0
Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . 	0
Why people visit museums ? 	0
As a lover of travel , a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour , which can be explained by the following reasons . 	1
Meanwhile , children ' s access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively . 	0
In conclusion , media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere . 	1
This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material . 	0
Further more , they will not value other people ' s hard work and take everything for granted . 	0
This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living . 	1
It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols , having messy sex lives . 	0
Meanwhile , not all celebrities are role models . 	0
Celebrities , for example movie stars , are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend , etc . It is human nature that people , especially youngsters , are attracted to the celebrities they favour , and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible . 	0
Drugs , alcohol and messy sex lives 	0
The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard . 	0
But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children . 	1
Of course , some celebrities , e . g . writers , passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world . 	1
Worse still , without proper parenting , children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living . 	1
Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . 	0
It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career . 	0
Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . 	0
You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . 	0
In result you learn quickly . 	1
For example , I have my personal experience . 	0
For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster . 	0
It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning . 	1
From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons . 	1
New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . 	0
As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . 	0
After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	1
To sum up , I admire my father ' s choice , while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert , like my mom , I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life . 	1
Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine . 	1
Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners . 	0
Moreover , they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life . 	0
Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity ; however , they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice . 	0
It will meliorate not only mental and body health , but also will establish in children a habit of doing it , giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules . 	1
Including physical activity in children ' s school day should be strongly considered . 	1
Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . 	0
Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
Testing is a very important aspect of life , and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team . 	0
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library . 	1
In spite of the importance of sports activities , libraries are more important . 	1
Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . 	0
It makes you perfect in time management skills . 	1
Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc . A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course . 	0
It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations . 	1
Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer 	0
With the tremendous development in information technology , long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school . 	0
Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate . 	0
From my perspective , I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education . 	1
To begin with , studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense . 	1
Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection . 	0
This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line . 	0
Besides that , long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches . 	1
However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	0
You can study any time you want . 	0
In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . 	0
The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . 	0
Studying at home by using technology is convenient . 	1
Here are my reasons . 	0
I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . 	1
Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school 	0
Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . 	0
First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . 	0
Sometimes , face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle . 	0
We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light , steering the world toward a much more convenient place . 	1
The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . 	0
For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . 	0
There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives . 	0
First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . 	1
When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . 	0
You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . 	0
People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? 	0
They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . 	0
One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about . 	1
Moreover , some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication . 	0
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication . 	0
For instance , I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric . 	0
If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important . 	0
Therefore , we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way . 	1
Finally , I realized that his facebook account was stolen . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face . 	1
He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore . 	0
I just shocked and did not know what happened . 	0
Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . 	0
So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	1
Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . 	0
With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . 	0
People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . 	0
Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	0
There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . 	0
Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . 	0
We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	0
Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . 	1
In addition , the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments . 	0
To conclude , as far as I am concerned , international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries . 	1
Thus , tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes . 	1
In conclusion , I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future . 	1
However , distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency , convenience and economic value , but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose . 	1
These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities . 	0
But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts . 	0
To sum it up , from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages . 	1
Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it . 	1
Last but not least , while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power . 	0
Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes . 	0
They have more opportunities , profits , and authorities . 	1
There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages , too , but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable . 	1
For all of them we have to ask for a permission , and most of the time we are not allowed . 	0
Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease , sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation . 	0
When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want . 	0
Finally , there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others . 	1
Furthermore , the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas . 	0
In a nutshell , varied characteristics of various people , feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life . 	1
Thereafter , the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also . 	0
Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones . 	0
Secondly , the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time . 	1
At a certain time , they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life . 	0
In my opinion , the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue . 	1
It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living . 	0
The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed , so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise . 	0
Last but not least , the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment . 	0
For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area . 	0
In addition , cooking is one of arts humans create . 	0
The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors . 	0
It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value . 	0
Moreover , communication is as well making a good roommate . 	0
It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member . 	0
One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project . 	0
People have different habit in daily life , such as tidy the blanket in the morning . 	0
Therefore , communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation . 	1
If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk . 	0
The sky is the limit ; there are all kinds of personality out there . 	0
We need to be flexible to be account into society . 	0
However , I think traditional games are still indispensible in children ' s learning process , even much more essential than modern games , especially in modern society . 	1
One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children ' s communication skills . 	0
With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . 	0
In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . 	0
Traditional games or modern games in developing children ' s skills 	0
Games have played a key role in children ' s growth , especially in terms of their abilities . 	0
This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games , which , in fact , helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future . 	0
At the same time , children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology , raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative . 	0
For me , I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games . 	1
It is true that modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend . 	1
All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . 	1
For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct . 	0
With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . 	0
According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . 	0
Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . 	1
In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life . 	0
Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . 	0
It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . 	0
Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . 	1
Let ' s imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people , but you have no experience of working alone , standardized tests such as SAT , TOEFL may be your nightmares . 	0
The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working . 	0
Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success . 	0
Despite the importance of working in team , I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant . 	1
Work in team or independently 	0
Nowadays , as the world is getting smaller , we need to be able to cooperate . 	0
In such circumstances , even when the scientists want to finish off quickly , but they couldn ' t miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems . 	0
To sum up , even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world , it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive . 	1
Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project , this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients . 	1
We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we ' ll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made . 	0
Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times , but with consistent work soon enough we ' ll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work . 	0
Secondly , other than the importance of accuracy , the world also seeks efficiency , which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality . 	0
Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic . 	1
A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars . 	0
This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . 	0
Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . 	0
Therefore , if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college , acing your school ' s final tests , you should consider learning to work on your own . 	1
Moreover , the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people . 	1
In this view , arts serve cultural and economic purposes . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure . 	1
Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts . 	0
This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage , which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry . 	0
Without arts , people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems . 	0
From the point of the local community , funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development . 	1
Currently , people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition . 	0
Consequently , they require various entertainment such as music , movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure . 	0
At the same time , the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous . 	1
Thus , only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness . 	0
Generally , personally speaking , I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government . 	1
And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this , because only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted . 	0
Otherwise , another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation . 	1
Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor . 	0
Except these , hundreds of problems would occur during the construction . 	0
