To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language . 	1
Based on the above discussion , I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem . 	1
Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture . 	1
It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . 	0
The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content , which can attract the audience . 	0
Furthermore , sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems . 	1
In other words , yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news , such as education , environment and public issues . 	0
Thus , these personal reports of famous people , unimportant information or distorted stories , will not solve problem related with the society . 	0
On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . 	0
Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear . 	1
It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . 	0
Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ? 	0
First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . 	0
On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . 	1
However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication . 	0
Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . 	1
Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
To conclude , Earth is our home and it should be protected . 	1
Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage . 	0
Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life . 	0
To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . 	0
Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . 	1
For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . 	0
Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . 	0
Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians . 	0
As a mass media majoring student , I think that it ' s true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society . 	1
Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media 	0
My reasons include the following : It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people . 	1
In my point of view , disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages . 	1
However , journalism is changing . 	0
The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip . 	0
First of all , gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion . 	1
Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues , paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people . 	0
Moreover , it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported . 	0
The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports , which seems to tell a story . 	0
In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful . 	1
I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown . 	1
Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on . 	0
Staying in one place is better than moving number of places 	0
If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . 	1
Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . 	0
In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . 	0
I was born and grew up in here , a small town . 	0
I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . 	1
Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	0
Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate . 	0
Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards . 	0
For example , the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams . 	0
Fossil fuels will soon be replaced ? 	0
Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy , as far as I ' m concerned , these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases , oil , and coal . 	1
Firstly , due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive . 	1
Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford . 	0
On the other hand , fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas . 	0
For example , it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy , say expensive solar batteries and wind farms . 	0
Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming . 	0
Besides , although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly ; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think . 	1
Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors , lawyers or engineers . 	0
Basic education teaches one child to read and write . 	0
Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information . 	0
A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient . 	0
A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment . 	0
In the same way , a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society . 	0
Collectively , the benefits of education can make a man , a society and a developed country . 	1
In conclusion , education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country . 	1
The more people in the country become educated , the better chance it can develop . 	1
With newly developing technologies , people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy . 	0
Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology . 	0
Of course , new technologies are always great . 	1
There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer . 	0
Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . 	1
A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	0
So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . 	1
Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	0
To sum up , it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country . 	1
It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same . 	1
Whereas , the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education , they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation , food , traveling , clothing , etc . Moreover , it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance , working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars , they need to concentrate on their studies . 	0
MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work , which takes their full concentration and surveys . 	0
University is more likely to become a money making business , the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students . 	1
In today ’ s world education is getting expensive , and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission . 	0
I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability . 	1
I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies , and this left them with only one choice , which is work . 	0
Should University education be free for everyone interested ? 	0
A famous proverb “ Knowledge is power ” has demonstrated the value of education . 	0
The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities . 	1
Therefore , universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars ; their message should be spread education , not making money , and motivate those scholars who want to get education . 	1
Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
Sense of cooperation 	0
A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . 	0
First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . 	0
Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . 	0
Study at school or get a job ? 	0
Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school . 	1
Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . 	0
Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . 	0
Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . 	0
For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	0
Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . 	1
In most countries , it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly . 	0
Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country 	0
There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities . 	0
In a developing country , not many can afford to send their children to school . 	0
These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen , can hardly eat three meals a day , let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday . 	0
As a result , these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents . 	1
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important . 	0
Things ended up that he joined in a great team , while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank . 	0
Thanks to Jeff ' s hard working during his leisure time , he learned a lot about the history of art . 	0
But , they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated . 	0
They majored in financing when they were in college . 	0
Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example . 	0
Second , when you want to translate your major , it is important to know some of the things about different fields . 	1
It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department , which made me popular there , and much easier to get the help that I need . 	0
While some of the problems are the Engineering department ' s part , I went there and discussed with the colleagues there , since I have studied some of the engineering courses . 	0
Education is undeniably an economic necessity . 	0
I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country . 	1
However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled . 	0
When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world . 	0
For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career . 	0
Is it necessary to teach children handwriting ? 	0
In this age of modern technology , some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children . 	0
To some people , it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task . 	0
From my point of view , children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons . 	1
Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities , handwriting still plays a vital role in students ' learning . 	1
Firstly , this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes , doing homework and writing . 	0
It enables to improve learners ' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well . 	0
Under the guidance of parents or teachers , children can benefit from practicing handwriting . 	0
In highly industrialized countries , undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all . 	0
They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands . 	0
Hence , it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful . 	1
To wrap it all up , it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person ' s life in order for one to prosper . 	1
However , it would be wrong to say that one ' s success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions . 	1
Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress . 	0
Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . 	0
Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	0
Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . 	1
Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . 	0
However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress . 	0
In conclusion , I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town . 	1
In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities . 	0
Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think . 	0
Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain , deduction of ozone layer and global warming ; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions . 	1
This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds . 	0
More importantly , the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up ; leaving problems for the following generations . 	0
With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable . 	0
In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound , there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon . 	1
For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain . 	0
These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy . 	0
As an engineering researcher , I will surely be disappointed for failure , and exited for new challenges . 	0
Just like a song , if I did not have challenge , life would be blue . 	0
Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier . 	0
While when it comes to " happier " , different type of jobs can be responsible factor . 	0
Although they can be familiar with their job , changing of job is what serve to their happier . 	0
Workers , who work for an ordinary company or industry , will be sick of same tasks day by day . 	0
To set another example , consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work , employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits . 	0
Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment , which , according to psychology theories , makes workers relaxed and happier . 	1
Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges , making life colorful . 	0
They both will be happy because the change of job , not the same task day by day . 	0
These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time . 	1
Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India , finally he became the father of the nation . 	0
Most of workers have adapted to do same task . 	0
While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job , but from my perspective , I am on the side of my father . 	0
As a authoritative dentist in my province , my mother has worked for 25 years . 	0
It allows us to achieve more . 	0
In my family , the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father ' s job . 	0
Different types of tasks endow more colors to our life 	0
Every time I asked him why , he will say , seriously , " I am done , doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different , that is all . " 	0
Five years ago , he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer , and became a landscape painter . 	0
About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . 	0
These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . 	0
In conclusion , from my point of view , type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone . 	1
To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory . 	0
To summarize , higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons . 	1
America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	0
Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . 	0
Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . 	1
However , it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars . 	1
Human activities are harming the Earth 	0
Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . 	1
Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . 	0
They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . 	0
Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . 	0
Overall , I believe that students should study at school . 	1
Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	0
There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job . 	0
Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job , studying at school is always the best choice for children ' s future . 	1
International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . 	1
My view is that international aid should be prioritised . 	1
They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . 	0
Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . 	0
The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . 	0
International aid 	0
However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . 	0
Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . 	0
It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	0
What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . 	0
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions . 	1
This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	0
For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . 	0
This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . 	0
Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . 	0
In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . 	1
As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	0
Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , living a slower life is advantageous for your health , your happiness and even the quality of your work . 	1
Moreover , the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills . 	0
For example , with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word , learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes . 	0
The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons . 	0
It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works . 	0
To conclude , no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing , handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people , especially students at the early age . 	1
Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . 	0
Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	1
Living in smal towns 	0
Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . 	0
Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . 	0
I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities . 	1
Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . 	0
One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . 	0
Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . 	0
Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . 	0
I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative . 	0
Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident . 	0
Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time . 	0
Therefore , e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out . 	0
For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do . 	0
I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive . 	0
She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed . 	0
In addition , writing e-mail helps people express honestly . 	1
Moreover , e-mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click . 	0
Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect . 	0
Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid . 	0
Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . 	0
Tax revenue is collected from those who works . 	0
Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	0
Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . 	0
Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless 	0
Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . 	1
However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out . 	1
Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . 	1
If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	0
This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content , elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities . 	0
Secondly , parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students ' school performance . 	1
In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
Therefore , the progress of news media is an advantageous development . 	1
For instance , paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers , causing severe water pollution . 	0
On the other hand , the dramatic majority of tourist , particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages , are well educated . 	0
Some people may oppose these , citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism . 	1
In fact , compared to the tourism industry , other alternatives , like resource extraction and manufacture , are far worse destroyers . 	0
In conclusion , it is evident that under suitable administration , the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks . 	1
It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so . 	0
After careful consideration of both sides of the argument , the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages . 	1
First and foremost , it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor , engineer and lawyer . 	1
Nevertheless , I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities . 	1
Not only that , when they are in a university , they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners . 	0
Without proper training and knowledge , it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers . 	0
In today ' s modern and competitive society , it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life . 	0
University education is needed for success 	0
I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree . 	0
Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions . 	0
Looking from another perspective , there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university . 	1
This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals . 	0
Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . 	1
That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note . 	1
This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers . 	1
The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about . 	0
Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also . 	0
It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis . 	1
Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects 	0
In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life . 	0
Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day , many people often get lost . 	0
However , it takes time for people to adapt them . 	0
For example , we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver ' s license or drive to bank for sending money . 	0
Technology designed to make people ' s lives simpler often make them more complicated 	0
However , even with all the conveniences , we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated . 	1
Therefore , I never have been rich in my life , because my salary is not dramatically changed . 	1
In spite of many problems of having own business , I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas . 	0
The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job . 	0
To sum up , in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves , I would like to run my own business to control my own time , and to earn more money based on my noble ideas . 	1
Finally , quality takes time . 	0
If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . 	0
Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . 	0
If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . 	0
For the above reasons , if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world , we must stop by these museums . 	1
During our trip , it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place . 	1
Moreover , a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit . 	1
Someone take a trip without making any plans , so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel . 	0
As a result , visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision . 	0
Most important of all , a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time . 	0
Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . 	0
However , from my point of view , television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other . 	1
Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends 	0
There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . 	0
Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . 	0
One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " . 	0
To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . 	1
One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . 	0
This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . 	0
That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . 	0
Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . 	0
I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	0
Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . 	1
The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . 	0
With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . 	0
In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	0
In conclusion , the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale . 	1
Although there are some inevitable problems , they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken . 	1
Instead of waiting for next publication , people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two . 	0
This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines . 	1
The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth . 	0
In such situations , newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media . 	0
But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details . 	0
This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines . 	0
People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research , satisfy interest , etc . For example , one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War . 	1
It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at . 	0
To conclude , the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons . 	1
Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people , paper media will continue for another few years . 	1
From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children . 	1
Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children . 	1
Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
Even in some cases , people compose a message with only emoticons ( the expressions by face created by service providers ) , which means there is no room for writing or typing texts . 	0
Moreover , it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying , writing assignments . 	0
If that tendency continues at a rapid pace , written language may face up to a real problem about its stand . 	0
In conclusion , we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity . 	1
They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways . 	0
The popularity of email and text messaging , as a result , leads to the losing of written language ' s position . 	1
People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities . 	0
The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form . 	0
Nevertheless , educators and individuals themselves , especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one . 	0
It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well . 	0
People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want . 	0
Especially , thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging ( SMS ) , it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information , even to many people at the same time . 	0
Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness , difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information . 	0
However , email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above . 	0
First of all , it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging , which answers to the question of their great popularity . 	1
Before email and mobile phone , human beings communicated by meeting directly , sending letters or later , calling from home phones . 	0
With this situation , some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language . 	1
I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means . 	0
Email and text messaging threats written language 	0
The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication . 	0
The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous , more than any school one person have studied . 	0
Thus , students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation , even from the whole world . 	1
For instance , my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam , Brazil , Argentina , etc . And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment , which is one of his main purposes when attending university . 	0
Last but not least , preparing for career is an essential function of university . 	1
Students not only do homework , assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work , internship and part time job . 	0
Thus , they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are . 	0
After all , they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives . 	0
In summation , people may attend university for various reasons . 	0
Some want to enjoy new experiences , some are going to prepare for their future career , while others are eager to develop their understanding . 	0
Even though the purposes could be various , everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best . 	1
Totally , the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free . 	0
Moreover , earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work . 	0
Work for themselves vs work for employer 	0
Most people want to work for an employer , because they want to feel secure about their salary , or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax , worrying about selling , etc . Despite these problems , personally , I would prefer to have my own job . 	1
My arguments are listed as follows . 	0
First , time is the more valuable thing , which I have in my life . 	1
By having my own business , I can manage my own time . 	0
I could work whenever I want , or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay . 	0
I can arrange time to travel when I would like . 	0
In addition , I can work long hours for earning more money . 	0
The long and the short of it , both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly . 	1
For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people . 	0
Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time . 	0
Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country 	0
There are two options to learn foreign language . 	0
Many people pursue to study foreign language . 	0
The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken . 	0
First is stay in homeland to study foreign language . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
Going to another place to learn language is better choice . 	1
In my city , National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts . 	0
To my astonishment , Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work , which is made of jade , is vividly shown . 	0
Secondary , visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon . 	1
Those outstanding and diverse range of objects , with classic and magnificent art , is guaranteed to inspire us ! 	0
Through the exhibit , I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom , and Ellis Island may be the place , where the immigration took their dreams and fears . 	0
Thus , museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place . 	1
Primary , it is easy to know the history of the new place . 	0
Last year , I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum , where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York . 	0
Why people visit museums ? 	0
As a lover of travel , a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour , which can be explained by the following reasons . 	1
Under suitable administration , tourism enhances local economic development 	0
Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy . 	0
Nevertheless , some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction , as a result of tourist activities , and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems . 	0
While both positions seem reasonable , my view is that , through proper management and regulation , a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas . 	1
The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region . 	1
This takes place , not only through direct expenditure from tourists , but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation , luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid , well-regulated tourism programs . 	0
Furthermore , tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community , including retail , hotels , transport , agriculture , and in the service industry . 	0
This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes . 	0
As a result , this gives energy to the economic cycle , generating local economic prosperity in return . 	0
For example , I worked in a large company , which has many different departments . 	0
First of all , when one knows different region ' s works , it will help one to get a friend much easier . 	1
The following will present my points . 	0
As far as I am concerned , having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success . 	1
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success , while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success . 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject . 	0
Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not 	0
What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone . 	0
I was in the Management Information System department . 	0
If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . 	0
To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . 	0
As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . 	0
If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . 	0
First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . 	1
In my opinion , we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons . 	1
But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? 	0
As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . 	0
In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . 	0
Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals 	0
As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . 	0
Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . 	0
Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . 	1
The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . 	0
There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments . 	0
Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable , but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons . 	1
Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life , it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above . 	1
This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly . 	0
For example , when the aircraft MH 370 went missing , everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident . 	0
Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines 	0
Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe . 	0
With this advancement , newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence . 	0
Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media . 	0
But many other still thinks they are going to stay . 	0
I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time . 	1
I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news . 	1
A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis . 	0
In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture . 	1
New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works , it also means through dealing with it , I will obtain more knowledge and experience . 	0
As the saying of a Chinese writer , the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf , but rather there always exists new things and challenge . 	0
After all , doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden , connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life . 	1
To sum up , I admire my father ' s choice , while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert , like my mom , I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life . 	1
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared . 	0
The best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important . 	1
However , what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed . 	0
In this way , it won ’ t be a problem at all . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can ’ t success one ’ s own major , what else things he can do in different filed . 	1
Of course , it may be true when talking about this topic . 	0
Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . 	0
Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone 	0
As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons . 	0
In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . 	0
Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . 	0
To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . 	0
Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	1
Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . 	0
In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . 	0
Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . 	1
These people depend solely on hard work and luck . 	0
Take for instance those who start their own business . 	0
To cite an example , Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19 . 	0
Interestingly , for some of them it proved to be a profitable job . 	0
Eventually , he used his earnings as well as his family ' s loan in order to progress to be who he is now . 	0
Initially , he started his computer company in his college dorm room . 	0
This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports . 	0
In addition , people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life . 	0
To illustrate this further , David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many . 	0
The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph . 	0
Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language . 	1
Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends . 	1
Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong . 	0
The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people . 	1
This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster . 	0
This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language . 	0
If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger . 	0
For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages . 	0
Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster . 	1
Different people attend university for different point of views . 	0
In my perspective , the three most reasons are increased knowledge , career preparation and new experiences . 	1
Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons 	0
From many centuries ago , universities have been playing an important role in ones ' life . 	0
Thus , people are able to strengthen their knowledge . 	0
Moreover , through the instructions of teachers , the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory , library , students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect . 	0
First of all , for most people , university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding . 	0
Truthfully , in this wonderful academic environment , everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers . 	0
Therefore , they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying . 	1
Secondly , studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life , which included many new experiences . 	0
Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . 	0
Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	0
I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	0
The traffic in the city was too crowed . 	0
Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . 	0
We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places . 	1
There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	0
I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . 	0
I also love the environment in here . 	1
Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic , people and of course the environment . 	1
For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . 	0
After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . 	0
In my opinion , it is very important to live life at a slower pace , because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages . 	1
First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . 	1
If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . 	0
Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . 	0
Rush vs Slower Pace 	0
Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously . 	0
However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . 	0
To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . 	0
Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way . 	0
As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter . 	0
It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers . 	0
Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . 	0
Problems and benefits of international tourism 	0
In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . 	0
In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . 	0
They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . 	0
In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity . 	1
After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	0
Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . 	0
Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . 	1
First and foremost , today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before . 	0
The fact is that such news media as televisions , radios , or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody . 	0
It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment , but also polishes up people ' knowledge . 	1
Therefore , it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development . 	0
Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits . 	0
However , it is possible that this idea is not completely true . 	0
The popularity of news media 	0
Nowadays news media have become more and more popular . 	0
People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want , from musical concerts to live football match . 	0
This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work . 	0
For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively . 	0
They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say . 	0
Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation . 	0
E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive . 	1
On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use . 	1
Its convenience saves our time . 	1
Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression . 	0
If the address is wrong , then you will know right away . 	0
We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address . 	0
Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day . 	0
E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face 	0
Voice mail , e-mail , telephone or just traditional way : face-to-face . 	0
Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much . 	0
Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication . 	1
However , I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating . 	1
For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact . 	0
You can talk to others from thousands mile . 	0
To clarify , my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of . 	0
Next , technology destroys the language . 	1
At first , I tried to go through all the instructions but , soon , I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn . 	0
However , even though I used it for couple months , I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently . 	0
For instance , I use new Iphone which I personally think is great . 	0
What are even worse , young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions . 	0
This has gotten worse with twitter , myspace , and facebook . 	0
Because people try to type as fast as they are talking , they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language . 	0
Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others , they created their own language to communicate . 	0
As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . 	1
To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . 	0
When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . 	0
Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . 	0
For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . 	0
In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . 	1
It enriches people ' s knowledge with worldwide information . 	0
It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects . 	0
This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society . 	0
Indeed , the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide . 	0
In conclusion , the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people . 	1
It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news . 	0
Obviously , the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings . 	1
In addition to this , news media help people broaden their knowledge . 	1
It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields , including political situation , economic change , global warming , and so forth . 	0
Hence , there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better . 	0
" Save the planet Earth " is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world . 	0
Arts and public services are both important to the community and should be invested properly 	0
There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre . 	0
While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion . 	1
However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . 	0
There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . 	0
Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? 	0
However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . 	0
Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	0
Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . 	1
One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . 	0
Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	1
To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . 	0
If I work for other people , I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply . 	0
Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? 	0
Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . 	0
Also , I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country . 	1
The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs . 	0
First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . 	1
In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . 	0
But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . 	1
After all , charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected . 	0
Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . 	1
By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	0
Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . 	0
In conclusion , people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary . 	1
However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . 	1
Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . 	0
I disagree with this view . 	0
Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . 	0
I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . 	1
These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy . 	0
The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment , for instance K-pop and Hollywood , and these industries can not survive without goverment ' s financial assistance . 	0
