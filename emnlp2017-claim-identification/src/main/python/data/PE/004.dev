However , the jury giving the verdict are also humans . 	0
They have the life of a person at their discretion . 	0
They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent , circumstantially marred criminals . 	1
The jury must therefore , take into account the circumstances of committing a crime . 	0
When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment , they will fear and not commit such crimes . 	0
Thus , the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased . 	1
Importantly , capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals . 	0
Criminals who don ' t have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are , therefore , given capital punishment . 	1
For example , if an individual murders someone for self-defense , then such a crime is not heinous . 	0
Only deserving criminals , who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment . 	0
In conclusion , considering the rise in accident rates , violent crime rates and suicide rates , I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence . 	1
It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life . 	0
Others believe that television , newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well . 	0
Nowadays , unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training . 	0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism ; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos . 	0
Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea . 	0
Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . 	0
Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	0
The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . 	0
In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . 	1
Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . 	0
In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . 	0
The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . 	0
Benefits of students ' unpaid work 	0
To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . 	1
In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end . 	0
As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . 	0
In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . 	0
As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . 	0
For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	0
For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . 	0
Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . 	0
Therefore , I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students . 	1
To begin with , going to classes are sometimes waste of the time . 	1
Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students . 	0
According to my opinion , because it is university level of education , students have enough maturity to choose their choice . 	1
Going to classes should be optional for the students 	0
University students have different opinion about their attendance to class . 	0
It was waste of the time . 	0
Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book . 	1
In conclusion , students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes . 	1
Besides , even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates . 	0
I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors . 	0
However , in my opinion , this is a rather immodest way of thinking . 	0
Doesn ' t self-study more efficient ? 	0
Why wasting time going to classes ? 	0
Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own . 	1
Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes . 	0
In other words , class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances . 	1
Many professors grade their students with class attendances . 	0
Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly 	0
With technology advances , food has become easier to prepare in modern days . 	0
People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before . 	0
Also , instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals . 	0
These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent . 	1
First of all , people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming . 	1
For instance , such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job . 	0
On the other hand , more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts . 	0
At the second point , since food preparation has become easier and more convenient , it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home . 	1
People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like . 	0
Things have changed a lot . 	0
I grow up in a better condition than my father did . 	0
In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage . 	0
For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help . 	0
What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects . 	1
For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors . 	0
Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help . 	0
They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot . 	0
He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot . 	0
Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction . 	0
Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	1
For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . 	0
However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . 	0
The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . 	0
Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . 	1
While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures , I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable , it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture . 	1
Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life . 	0
Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways 	0
Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . 	0
However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . 	1
Third , technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country . 	1
A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages . 	0
So , it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country . 	1
Also , highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges . 	0
To sum up , it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country . 	1
It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same . 	1
Additionally , there are Reality TV , television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations , for example like " Big Brother " . 	0
To sum up , it is clear that television , magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples ' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above , namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV . 	1
At the same time , rather than attending any boring lecturers , students can participate to other activities such as debate competition , swimming meet , Basketball and so forth . 	1
From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them . 	0
Additionally , mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures . 	0
Besides , most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time . 	0
Students need to work as part time basis . 	0
Hence , they have to schedule the lectures time , studying time and working time . 	1
Moreover , with the modern technology , students can collect more information from different sources . 	1
For example , from the Internet , students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently . 	0
However , some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way . 	1
When the students attend that lectures , they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time . 	0
People have a lot of things to learn in their lives . 	0
It helps animals out of extinction . 	1
It is very crucial for learning . 	1
First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . 	1
Also , it is a interesting travel location . 	1
Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . 	0
Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose 	0
I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings . 	1
However , I do not agree with them . 	0
Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . 	0
When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? 	0
Therefore , to conclude my opinion on this statement , I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life . 	1
I also became more casual and social with others , this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills . 	0
I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted , but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them . 	0
When I moved to college hostel after school , first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known . 	0
We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time , but when we think back about those moments later in life , we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves . 	0
Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly . 	1
So , all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through . 	0
It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb . 	0
Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life . 	1
Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household . 	1
Personally , I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly . 	1
Why and why not ? 	0
Do married women usually work ? 	0
This is really necessary in cases of her husband ' s low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present . 	0
By taking up a job , a wife can earn more money to support her family life . 	0
Firstly , extra income that women earn will contribute to their family ' s expenses . 	0
I will mention some basic reasons as following . 	0
Secondly , working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world , strengthen their character and show their capacity . 	0
So , it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money . 	1
People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in . 	0
If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class . 	0
What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction . 	1
And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years . 	0
The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important . 	0
New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government 	0
The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays . 	0
Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government . 	0
Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency . 	0
My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information . 	1
In this case , students learn things easily . 	0
In China , some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people . 	0
Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories , they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases . 	0
These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work . 	0
Second , beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs , which are the most fundamental requirements for people . 	1
Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years . 	0
For example , Workers in the FOXCONN factory , which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company , just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day . 	0
Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil . 	0
In order to build city and factory , people destroy huge forests . 	0
Without beautiful environment , people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety . 	0
Nowadays , the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly . 	0
Improvements in health , education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations . 	0
Richer nations should help poorer nations in health , education and trade 	0
Firstly , in the area of health , poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations . 	0
Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries . 	1
On top of that , poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients . 	0
High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident . 	0
Secondly , in the area of education , it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions . 	0
To solve these issues , richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals . 	1
In order to solve the education manpower problem , richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries . 	1
Besides that , education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it . 	0
By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource . 	0
Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does 	0
With the development of the economy , people become more and more rich . 	0
They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness . 	0
While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people , I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us . 	1
However , people should concern more about their living environment than job . 	1
First , for most of us , job is only a tool to maintain our lives . 	0
Both sides of the arguments have its merits . 	0
Benefits of students doing extra jobs 	0
In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . 	0
This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . 	0
In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained . 	0
It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . 	0
Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . 	0
In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . 	0
As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . 	0
Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	1
Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . 	1
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
Hence , we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports . 	0
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable . 	0
Second , I think watching television programs makes us lazy . 	1
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office . 	0
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers . 	0
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors . 	0
Last but not least , some television programs have a negative effect on viewers . 	1
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity . 	0
To sum up , killing our time , making us lazy , and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive . 	1
I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution . 	1
The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading . 	0
As a token of goodwill , richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading . 	0
Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland . 	1
In conclusion , richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health , education and trade . 	1
Lastly , in the area of trade , no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money . 	1
Meanwhile , for the issue of education fee , richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students . 	1
For example , residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production . 	0
Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure . 	0
They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn . 	0
People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn . 	0
The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things . 	1
To sum up , students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say . 	1
Thus , I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions . 	1
Famous people are bothered by the media 	0
Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs . 	0
This issue is a controversial one , but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons . 	1
One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples ' lives in order to increase their audience or readership . 	1
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs . 	0
Thanks to the Internet , we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don ' t need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience . 	0
Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip . 	1
Just imagine : if a student can ' t even make out whether the source is reasonable or not , then how can he get the right information to help him to learn ? 	0
Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong . 	1
Students have knowledge of others cultures , outer space etc . Personally , I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source . 	1
For instance , Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes . 	0
Moreover , they contend that good television programs do teach students . 	0
They can only input some key words and google it , and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it . 	0
Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources , such as the Internet and television , firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can ' t learn in classes . 	1
Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements . 	0
Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students . 	0
First , in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams . 	1
In my opinion , I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is . 	1
These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . 	0
Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . 	0
In university education , students are given much independence in the ways of learning . 	0
University students should attend classes or not ? 	0
Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves . 	0
Second , it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class . 	0
Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want . 	0
No known scientist has success in first attempt . 	0
All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations . 	1
But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk . 	0
For example , when they tried to learn walking , they stumble and hurt themselves many times . 	0
Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking , eating , etc . , but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life . 	1
The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood . 	0
My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled , improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life . 	1
I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future . 	0
Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life 	0
Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . 	0
The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . 	0
Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	0
Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . 	0
In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . 	0
Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . 	1
Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	0
They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . 	0
So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . 	0
Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . 	0
Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need . 	1
It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future . 	0
Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . 	1
Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . 	0
By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . 	0
Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	0
In conclusion , I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . 	1
By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation . 	1
With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . 	0
Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	1
As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
To give a brief conclusion , Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways . 	1
Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	0
With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . 	0
Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends , which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes . 	0
Despite this , it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals ' personalities . 	0
With those arguments in mind , I would conclude that people should , especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge , care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world ' s changes . 	1
Consequently , the world would look monotonous . 	1
On the other hand , creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas , developing their own fashion styles as they like . 	1
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
Some of them had no own savings . 	0
As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
Saving / Spending money 	0
Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . 	1
They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . 	0
For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . 	0
Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . 	1
Amount of control on media information 	0
Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . 	0
It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . 	0
However , I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures . 	1
A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . 	0
This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	0
Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered . 	0
Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning . 	0
I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten . 	1
This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning . 	0
Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to . 	0
To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years . 	1
Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children . 	0
Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten 	0
However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years . 	0
Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school . 	0
Thus , capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals . 	1
Moreover , capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes . 	0
Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings . 	0
When a criminal becomes a threat to the society , such that they can commit heinous crimes , then they are given capital punishment . 	0
However , strict laws , like capital punishment , are essential in a society . 	1
Capital punishment is given only in the " rarest of the rare " cases . 	0
Retribution is the method for countering criminals . 	0
Some countries have stringent rules , like capital punishment , while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system . 	0
Capital punishment - necessary or not 	0
Crime is always punishable . 	0
I firmly believe that psychopaths , terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment . 	1
Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society . 	1
However , it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict . 	0
Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner . 	1
Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . 	1
Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . 	0
For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . 	0
This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . 	0
From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . 	1
Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime . 	1
Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . 	0
And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals . 	0
We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place . 	0
To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems . 	1
One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa . 	0
There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot . 	1
Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030 . 	0
If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental . 	0
By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions . 	0
It would mean another industrial revolution . 	0
It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes . 	0
Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
True function of a university 	0
Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
That ’ s why it is important to take risks . 	1
In sum , I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them . 	1
The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . 	0
If you don ’ t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . 	0
If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . 	0
If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . 	0
I believe that with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily . 	1
In a word , our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life . 	1
What they want is help their child to make a progress . 	0
Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can . 	0
Moreover , advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers . 	1
Take Coca cola for an example , this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising . 	0
Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion 	0
On these days , with the assistance of advertisement , people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement . 	0
Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages , I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives . 	1
On the one hand , it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell . 	0
In addition to this , all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods . 	1
For example , some kinds of shampoo , namely Sunsilk , Clear , Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits . 	0
However , the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement . 	0
On the other hand , it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers , writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands . 	1
Last but not least , nowadays , there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work . 	1
Therefore , it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better . 	1
These women will set a good example for their children . 	0
These things in turn will make them more confident , independent . 	0
In conclusion , a well-organized home does not need the housewife ' s presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home . 	1
Besides the gorvernment ' s policies on limited families and their husbands ' sharing in the housework , many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women . 	0
First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university . 	0
Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career . 	1
The opportunity to receive education from university 	0
There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success . 	0
However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate . 	0
Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success . 	0
It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family . 	1
I agree with this statement . 	0
In my opinion , family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success . 	1
There are a couple of reasons . 	0
Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries . 	0
Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury . 	1
Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia . 	0
Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only . 	1
For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record . 	0
We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality . 	0
Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder . 	0
Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions . 	0
In conclusion , I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict . 	1
It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well . 	0
We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart . 	0
They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back . 	0
They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment . 	0
Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment . 	1
On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment . 	1
If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment . 	0
It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems . 	0
Can technology alone solve the world ' s environmental problems ? 	0
In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints . 	0
Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems . 	0
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ? 	0
Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . 	0
He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . 	0
Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . 	0
This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication . 	0
Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . 	1
Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . 	0
Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . 	0
They are kept for security purposes in houses . 	0
On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . 	1
Firstly , celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans . 	0
Nevertheless , I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments . 	1
If they continue to behave in such a way , it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work . 	0
For example , some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media , thereby gaining the public attention . 	0
This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits . 	0
Consequently , the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status . 	1
Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do . 	0
Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction 	0
It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public . 	0
While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation , this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs . 	1
Therefore , this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance . 	0
This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results . 	0
Take Michael Jackson as an example , his works are widely spread around the world , and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation . 	0
Secondly , other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career . 	0
In summary , although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance , other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction . 	1
His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other , which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society . 	0
The learning process itself , however , is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student . 	0
It ' s an essential learning process . 	1
Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning . 	0
Admittedly , job can bring us happiness . 	1
People can receive a sense of values and respected from job . 	0
If people receive respect from others , they will feel achievement and self-confidence . 	0
In addition , job can provide money to us . 	1
In conclusion , it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers . 	1
When the students go to university , they have matured mentally and physically . 	1
In a nutshell , although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures , some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students ' time . 	1
Therefore , to make use of time , if the students choose the classes as optional , it would provide more benefits than drawbacks . 	1
They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do . 	1
To sum up , everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception . 	0
From my point of view , advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product . 	0
No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world . 	0
Last but not least , online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost , convenience and easily observing . 	0
Thirdly , the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide . 	1
What is worse , some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police , which makes citizens always live in danger . 	0
Take an example , in American , young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns , which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting . 	0
Eventually , guns will create a violent society if the trend continues . 	0
Unfortunately , there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over . 	0
In the US , firearms remain the most common method of suicide , accounting for about 50 per cent . 	0
When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world ' s cutting-edge fashion information , they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world , which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world . 	0
This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world ' s latest transformations , which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today . 	1
As a result , they might fall behind shortly . 	0
In contrast , if they stuck to their own fashion styles , disregarding the world ' s top fashion designers ' achievements , they would stay conservative in their own worlds . 	0
With increasing availability to the Internet , people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world , such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year . 	0
should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style ? 	0
From my perspective , fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people ' s lives than personal dressing styles . 	1
However , some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends . 	0
Without following fashion trends , such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes , let alone forming their own dressing styles . 	1
Furthermore , people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information . 	0
And when they are in primary school , teachers teach them more further knowledge , like writing skills and using computers . 	0
They argue that teachers teach students how to write , read and calculate since they are in kindergarten . 	0
Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers . 	1
Now , many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful . 	0
They all enrich our daily lives . 	0
There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives , such as the Internet , television and cell phone . 	0
Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations . 	0
Lessons with teachers versus others sources 	0
On the other hand , students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers . 	0
It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling . 	0
In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things . 	1
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend . 	0
Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years . 	0
In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers . 	0
In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them . 	0
It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages . 	1
Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years . 	0
I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children . 	1
In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree . 	0
The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity . 	0
For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader , they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group , or even a situation . 	0
There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives . 	0
First of all , learning by doing things develops our maturity . 	1
When you do things by your self , you learn to depend on yourself . 	0
You will not be in need to refer to books or persons . 	0
People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer ? 	0
They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills . 	0
One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about . 	1
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday . 	0
At the end , there is no time for call to our parents or friends . 	0
Television is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family 	0
It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television . 	0
Nowadays , number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday . 	0
Unfortunately , most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television . 	1
I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties . 	1
In spite of enjoying watching television shows , it is really time consuming task . 	1
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising . 	0
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities . 	0
Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things . 	0
So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them . 	1
Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things . 	0
With the time , Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring . 	0
People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming . 	0
Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming . 	0
There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them . 	0
Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing . 	0
We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading . 	0
Secondly , learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about . 	1
I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth . 	1
If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . 	0
That also make money flow , and then economics become better . 	0
It benefits to a certain country . 	1
In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives . 	1
Secondly , most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns , especially in some countries where guns are available for people . 	1
So the fewer guns possessed , the fewer accidents would happened , our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates . 	1
Therefore , this is still a controversial topic around the world . 	0
However , gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others . 	0
Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society , which is strictly controlled in most countries . 	0
Gun control 	0
For example , we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting . 	0
The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns . 	0
The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns . 	0
From my point of view , it is sensible to enforce the gun control . 	1
Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	1
The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks . 	1
There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . 	0
For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . 	0
By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . 	0
Successful people try new things and take risks 	0
I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . 	0
There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . 	0
These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ’ t be always found in books . 	1
I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . 	0
Which is better - Learning foreign language in home or host country ? 	0
Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language . 	0
Also , I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country . 	1
The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs . 	0
First of all , it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities . 	1
In the earlier periods , it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge . 	0
But with the advent of globalization , one can easily find a teacher in their own country . 	1
In conclusion , the time-saving , simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities , more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals . 	1
Of course , there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider . 	0
More men , on the other hand , are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before . 	0
This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases . 	1
Nevertheless , for the reasons that I have presented above , I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly . 	1
For example , in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french , german etc . Second , colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum . 	0
Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university . 	0
Thus , only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness . 	0
Generally , personally speaking , I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government . 	1
And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this , because only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted . 	0
Otherwise , another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation . 	1
Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor . 	0
Except these , hundreds of problems would occur during the construction . 	0
