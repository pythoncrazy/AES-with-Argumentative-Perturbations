Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need . 	0
A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure . 	0
There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed , because from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity . 	0
Finally , the society needs a civilized environment and orders . 	1
And a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities . 	0
In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners . 	0
there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . 	0
Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ? 	0
The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate . 	0
All in all , I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world . 	1
Finally , I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job . 	0
Secondly , people will get respect from politeness within each other . 	1
Taking IT industry for an example , top technical science is published in English . 	0
Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English . 	0
Hence , the culture heritage and nation identity vanish . 	1
Admittedly , opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year . 	0
In conclusion , in spite of some negative effects , I ' m totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around . 	1
However , this is really short-sighted , ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society . 	0
But at the same time , actions , like recording , can be taken to protect native languages and cultures . 	0
I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization . 	0
Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
Second , learning abilities in each students is different . 	0
If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know . 	0
Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . 	0
It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . 	0
This problems depend on how hard study they do . 	0
Therefore , testing result are different . 	0
Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get . 	1
It is not teachers fault . 	0
Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered . 	0
In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity . 	1
As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries . 	1
Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other . 	0
In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union . 	0
It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home . 	1
Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss . 	0
In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency . 	1
It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away . 	0
In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing . 	0
Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works . 	1
For example , people are easily distracted while working at home . 	0
It ' s more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone . 	0
For another example , if one â€™ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix . 	0
In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office . 	1
First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly . 	1
They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together . 	0
Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss . 	0
Working at home vs Working in a company 	0
Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them . 	0
People are no longer restricted in the office . 	0
This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office . 	0
Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . 	0
We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success . 	0
Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children . 	0
Co-operation is essential for teamwork . 	1
However , co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle . 	0
Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed . 	0
The modern society is full of cut-throat competition . 	0
Competition or co-operation-which is better 	0
It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . 	0
For instance , lions hunt in a team . 	0
We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone , especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off . 	0
However , the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles . 	0
They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them . 	0
Therefore , it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills . 	1
Celebrities & Their Influences 	0
Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth . 	0
To some extent , I do not agree with this statement . 	0
First of all , it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people . 	1
Moreover , it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities ' world without any talents or achievements . 	0
We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows , for example ; The Voice , X Factor or Next Top Models etc . As a result , to become a star and an inspiration for people , a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates . 	0
They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
Gender Equality at university admission 	0
Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution . 	0
To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis . 	1
In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . 	0
Living and studying overseas 	0
Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	0
First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . 	1
One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . 	0
Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . 	1
Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . 	0
Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	0
In other words , reducing risks and enhancing individual ' s capability is the most important path to success . 	0
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
So that , I disagree with this notion . 	0
Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . 	1
Everyone is different . 	0
Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . 	0
Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . 	0
Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . 	1
In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . 	0
To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . 	0
This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	0
Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . 	1
Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . 	0
After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories . 	1
Apartments vs dormitories at university 	0
Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . 	0
You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . 	0
An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . 	0
First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . 	1
While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . 	0
In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend , which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them , and also be able to teach them teamwork skill . 	0
Sense of cooperation 	0
A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers , and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents , to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system . 	1
However , some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative , both the values have its arguments . 	0
Being competitive leads them to success , but could also restrict them in many ways . 	0
Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently , but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others . 	0
On the other hand , cooperation is also an essential quality for children , no matter in school activities or in communities . 	1
For example , it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project . 	0
After all , in society , there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself . 	0
Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others , which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team . 	0
For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
The lower the factors making us fail we have , the higher probability to success we own . 	0
I favor the latter ; that is , successful people still do things they already know . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful , we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter . 	0
Some people tend to believe that to be successful , they should do something they are unfamiliar with , while others seem to stand on the opposite place . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I develop my own perspective as well . 	0
Successful people do something new or take risks 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things , and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest , and then just waits for the not so high but constant income . 	0
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time . 	0
You set your own schedules . 	0
In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	0
This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . 	0
Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . 	0
You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . 	0
The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	0
Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . 	1
A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . 	0
Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . 	0
For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . 	0
To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . 	1
Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . 	0
Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . 	0
I would explore my primary reasons here . 	0
Of course don ' t . 	0
Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . 	0
And also when you see an airport ? 	0
Do you think they have built by chance ? 	0
What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? 	0
What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? 	0
That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously . 	1
Thus , only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore , it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters . 	1
As a result , they have no choice but choosing English as a second language . 	0
It ' s neither to get a translated version of these articles , nor to always have a translator besides . 	0
To begin with , communication between countries and cultures become convenient . 	0
No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally . 	1
Thus , studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters . 	0
In my country , English is a required course from elementary school . 	0
In the present age , it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English . 	0
Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages 	0
Personally , I agree with the former opinion . 	0
Some people claim it ' s a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits . 	1
This , in turn , enhances relationship and promotes international business . 	0
For them , language obstacle is no longer a problem , which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country . 	0
These are two sides of the same coin which can ' t be separated . 	0
I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition . 	1
A healthy competition which involves raising one ' s own level above others is the best approach . 	0
Thus , competition and co-operation go hand in hand . 	0
' Your loss , my gain ' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run . 	0
Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule . 	1
This kind of competition gives customers more options . 	0
However , blind and selfish competition is detrimental . 	0
They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition . 	0
When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together , success , achievements , recognition and any goal becomes easier . 	0
Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . 	1
Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached . 	0
Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . 	0
To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . 	0
Universtiy is an entrance to life . 	0
University education restriction 	0
It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . 	0
It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . 	0
However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . 	0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain . 	0
It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . 	0
Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . 	0
I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . 	0
So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . 	0
Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired . 	0
In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones . 	0
Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant . 	1
Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated . 	1
With the advent of iPads in e-learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once . 	0
This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future . 	1
In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness . 	1
As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events . 	1
This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . 	0
South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . 	0
For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . 	0
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment . 	0
That is problem in quality of education . 	0
Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . 	0
To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
On the other hand , it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection , and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment . 	1
For instance , many people driving private cars could cause air pollution , and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment . 	0
If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities , this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement . 	0
In conclusion , the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues , but every citizen also can contribute to the environment . 	1
In my point of view , though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success , but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work . 	1
For example , famous singers or movie stars , despite of their talent to make them successful , there are always a team to manage works or deal with things . 	0
To sum up , I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community . 	1
Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	1
Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . 	0
In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles . 	0
Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war . 	0
Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets . 	1
In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity . 	0
In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now . 	0
Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living . 	0
In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future . 	1
The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject . 	0
Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century . 	0
Nowadays , spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable 	0
It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection . 	0
This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society , and the government controls many influential media , such as TV stations and newspapers , which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens . 	1
There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that . 	0
Personally , I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment , but we need to analyze some specific situations . 	1
The environment problems facing today ' s world are so great 	0
Nowadays , many countries are concerned with the environment problems . 	0
However , individuals are unable to cope with these things . 	0
Besides , the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people . 	0
On one hand , solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies , and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems . 	1
For example , air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries , and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution , while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances . 	0
In conclusion , people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation . 	1
Sometimes , they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people . 	0
For example , a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet . 	0
In my opinion , I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information , people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world . 	1
First of all , everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives . 	1
Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet . 	0
However , some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information . 	1
The internet provides a lot of valuable information 	0
In the modern society , internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century . 	0
In addition , people can gain more knowledge by using the internet , the most useful technology in the world . 	1
Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge . 	0
For example , I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers . 	0
In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other . 	0
Recently , the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners . 	0
They are being rude towards others . 	0
A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues 	0
Once a celebrity said : A man ' s manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues . 	0
First of all , a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression . 	1
Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible . 	0
Due to this phenomenon , someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other . 	0
Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following . 	0
Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention . 	0
In my opinion , we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment . 	1
Should animals be free or live in zoos ? 	0
Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals . 	0
Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas . 	0
When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with , they begin to loose those in-born instincts . 	0
Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals . 	1
Firstly , like we , human beings , animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts . 	0
Hence , when they are released or in the worst case , when they escape , they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate . 	0
In addition to the previous point , various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care . 	1
For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications . 	0
However , according to my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence . 	0
Try something new can indeed make people become special , while it does not mean successful . 	0
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm . 	0
In contrast , those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks . 	1
Admittedly , on the other hands , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others , which is also a widely accepted idea for success . 	1
Therefore , we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks . 	1
Moreover , another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not . 	0
At least , a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success . 	0
For instance , the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills . 	0
Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal . 	1
Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . 	0
Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . 	0
Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type 	0
On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . 	1
The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . 	0
Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance " a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction " . 	1
First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . 	1
Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	1
Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . 	0
They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places . 	0
Moreover , people can learn other countries ' s culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations . 	0
To conclude , people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying , doing business and exploring the world . 	1
With valuable information it provides , people can enjoy their lives much more . 	1
Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge . 	0
For instance , people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it . 	0
Last but not least , The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing . 	1
This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet . 	0
Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
For example , every other day , new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others . 	0
Competition helps in improvement and evolution . 	1
Competition has helped the development of science and technology . 	0
An individual must compete with oneself only , instead of trying to beat others . 	0
Unfortunately , the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction . 	0
However , competition is also as important as co-operation . 	0
A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people ' s achievements . 	0
It helps to identify one ' s strengths and weaknesses as compared to others . 	0
Nevertheless , co-operation helps to understand other ' s perspective and learn by their mistakes . 	1
In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate . 	0
To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory . 	1
Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . 	1
To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	0
For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	0
In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . 	1
In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . 	0
Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	0
Haste makes waste 	0
This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one . 	1
In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons : For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . 	0
Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . 	1
Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . 	0
Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace . 	1
This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . 	0
For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . 	0
Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . 	0
This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols . 	0
It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation . 	1
This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . 	0
For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . 	0
Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings 	0
What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . 	1
Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively . 	1
In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . 	1
Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white-collar ones . 	0
That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners . 	1
In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . 	0
By way of conclusion , it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases . 	1
However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished . 	0
They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . 	0
It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	0
Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get . 	1
Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . 	0
Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . 	0
This problem should not be happened . 	0
Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher . 	1
If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . 	0
You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . 	0
Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . 	0
Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	0
These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . 	0
The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . 	1
In the end , I think any great success need great work not great luck , even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans . 	1
Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	0
He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	0
Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . 	1
I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . 	0
For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . 	0
Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . 	0
But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . 	0
For instance , I recall my first trip to a zoo , at age eight . 	0
I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated . 	0
I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo . 	0
They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible . 	1
Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals . 	1
Moreover , many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them . 	1
In conclusion , i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one . 	1
As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops . 	0
I have different reasons to hold that , such as having a better chance to find work , having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences . 	1
For instance , common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won ' t give the same salary as a small local company . 	0
In other words , this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees . 	0
large companies have an international reputation , as they organize international conferences , meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people . 	1
Third , I love travelling around the world . 	0
However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life . 	1
In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas . 	1
Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . 	1
Distance-learning vs . attending school in person 	0
A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . 	0
From my perspective , online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions . 	1
To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . 	1
In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . 	0
Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . 	0
Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . 	0
Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . 	1
To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers . 	0
Second , technology also makes teaching simpler . 	1
Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused . 	0
Technology makes people ' s lives simpler rather than complicated 	0
Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more . 	1
Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier . 	0
First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler . 	1
In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view . 	0
Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times . 	0
With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle . 	0
In my opinion , one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons . 	1
While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas . 	0
For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them . 	0
In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . 	1
Besides , learning abilities of student are different . 	1
As can be seen from this , is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one . 	1
That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him . 	0
The fact that a company is a large one , this means that it ' s having a considerable success . 	0
Second , I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one . 	1
Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context , success and needs of their work . 	0
Some people prefer to work for a large company 	0
I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons . 	1
Small companies usually have a local job in the area , while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries . 	0
Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing , managing and selling their products in different countries . 	0
First , to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company . 	1
In other words , Large company equals more job opportunity . 	0
For example , if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country , they would need more employees in that country to work there . 	0
