Simply put , charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful . 	1
In conclusion , " rush hours " are usually not the direct consequence of drivers . 	1
Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light , or unreasonable organization of roadways . 	0
In these cases , the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner , not drivers . 	0
Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance , and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights . 	0
Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee , government should instead , be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil . 	1
Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand ; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear . 	0
Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous . 	1
Instead , the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds , and therefore , charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational . 	1
These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Finally , a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented . 	1
As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in , scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks . 	0
By observing planet earth from outer space , people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth . 	0
With this knowledge , people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming . 	0
As a conclusion , I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space . 	1
In spite of costing a fortune , space exploration has given aforementioned benefits . 	0
Oxygen tanks , for instance , are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater . 	0
Moreover , spaceships , communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society . 	0
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	1
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
In other word , tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential . 	0
Secondly , even though environmental damage is inevitable , it is not tourism to be blamed for . 	0
First of all , tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be . 	1
Basically , places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet . 	0
Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up . 	0
It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents . 	0
Tourism : good or bad ? 	0
Tourism , since its first appearance a long time ago , can be described as a controversial celebrity . 	0
Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion , environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places . 	0
However , I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons . 	0
We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes . 	0
What is more , the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species . 	0
Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as : giraffe , panda , koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory . 	0
In sum , the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable . 	1
It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency . 	0
Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea . 	0
Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example , the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths . 	0
Even so , another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest . 	0
The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens . 	0
In other words , the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner , especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases . 	1
Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind . 	1
Doing all jobs at home don ' t make employees attempt to work like this . 	1
Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience , but i don ' t . 	0
Computers have made it possible for office workers to do their work 	0
Then again , the workers must try their best to finish the time limit . 	0
The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects . 	0
Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible . 	0
Pressure is motivation . 	0
The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working . 	0
However , the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people . 	1
For another , using machines can save company ' s money . 	0
Because machines never ask for salary , over-time pay or pension , so employers do not need to spend money on employee ' s welfare . 	0
For one thing , machines are more effective than human . 	0
Not like human , machines do not need rest , which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes . 	0
In my opinion , although using machines have many benefits , we cannot ignore its negative effects . 	1
It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits . 	1
Advantages and disadvantages of machines instead of human to do the work 	0
The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people . 	0
In my hometown , I have a lot of friends and good relationships , I love the traffic in here , and the environment is wonderful . 	1
I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown . 	1
Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job , house , community and so on . 	0
Staying in one place is better than moving number of places 	0
If anyone needs help , his neighbor will help as much as possible . 	1
Every people in my town have known each others , and we have good relationships . 	0
In here , I have a lot of friends , and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer , basketball and of course we have a lot of fun . 	0
I was born and grew up in here , a small town . 	0
I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here . 	1
Nowhere else can give me some people like in here . 	0
Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion 	0
Recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation . 	0
Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . 	0
In my opinion , I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced . 	1
In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . 	0
Firstly , an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution . 	0
Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air , the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants . 	0
Therefore , it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles . 	1
Secondly , an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion . 	0
Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while . 	0
From my perspective , the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons . 	1
Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . 	0
The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation . 	0
Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important 	0
Most importantly , there are many accidents happening on the roads . 	0
Moreover , the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing . 	0
The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia . 	0
First and foremost , we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents . 	1
Each year , Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan . 	0
For example , in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents . 	0
Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology . 	1
For instance , factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products , the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead , new video games has superseded the old-physical ones . 	0
However , these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones . 	0
The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working , it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries . 	0
Thanks to modern technology , our life has been improved with many gadgets . 	1
While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures , I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable , it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture . 	1
Nowadays , technology has been developing significantly , impacting many aspects of our life . 	0
Modern technology has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways 	0
Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world . 	0
However , despite the drawback mentioned above , technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways . 	1
It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old . 	1
By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life . 	1
They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	0
Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . 	0
Who would the employer choose , an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . 	0
Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . 	1
However , in my point of view , it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company . 	1
All in a nutshell , workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects . 	1
Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace . 	0
In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution . 	0
To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis . 	1
It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment . 	0
Living and studying overseas 	0
There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home . 	1
Interaction is a factor increasing working quality . 	0
Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life . 	0
First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures . 	1
One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life . 	0
Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet . 	1
Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills . 	0
Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else . 	0
The dos and don ' t at office play important role to prevent these things from workers . 	0
Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites , however , they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job . 	0
Besides , interaction help employees improve their communicational skills , therefore , they will have more and more friends and relationships . 	0
Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people . 	0
Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices . 	1
The best condition might not be good for people . 	0
Firstly , many facts about solar system can be discovered . 	1
It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour . 	0
For instance , I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home . 	0
Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads . 	0
Secondly , investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work . 	1
Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried . 	0
All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes . 	0
Last but not least , spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality . 	1
In contrast , if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions . 	0
What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier . 	0
We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities . 	0
Nevertheless , we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade . 	0
They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use . 	0
On the whole , I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in . 	1
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester . 	0
However , research done by universities proves that student ' s performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning , preparation and examination schedule . 	0
So other several , prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically . 	0
Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning . 	0
Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules . 	0
One long vacation or several long vacation 	0
Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student ' s get relief form exam pressure . 	0
Firstly , several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low . 	1
However , i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics . 	1
In both the scenario students relief themselves . 	0
It helps animals out of extinction . 	1
It is very crucial for learning . 	1
First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge . 	1
Also , it is a interesting travel location . 	1
Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily . 	0
Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose 	0
I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings . 	1
However , I do not agree with them . 	0
Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning . 	0
When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? 	0
All thing considered , tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact . 	1
In my opinion , the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings . 	1
Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment-friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures . 	0
Because of that , tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity . 	1
In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration . 	0
To be precise , for instance , a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild . 	0
Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button . 	0
To begin with , famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people . 	1
Hard work make you a professional man / woman which are powerful in his or her job . 	0
Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success , but to be frank I cannot agree with them . 	0
I would explore my primary reasons here . 	0
Of course don ' t . 	0
Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google , Yahoo etc . created by chance . 	0
And also when you see an airport ? 	0
Do you think they have built by chance ? 	0
What ' s more important : hard work or luck ? 	0
What do you think when you see a beautiful building ? 	0
My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information . 	1
In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . 	0
Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . 	1
Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages . 	0
Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people . 	0
Moreover , parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children . 	0
In this way , communication between family members is visibly destroyed . 	1
Last but not least , watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human . 	1
For example , watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing . 	0
What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does ? 	0
is this one of the reason cause division in society ? 	0
In conclusion , though television has some good sides , it has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television . 	0
About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game . 	0
These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time . 	0
In conclusion , from my point of view , type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone . 	1
To my rivals ' surprise , being the only member of my own " team " I gained a victory . 	0
If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . 	0
Then we will feel less interested in them . 	0
However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper . 	1
First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . 	0
While there are also some people who do not like this . 	0
Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . 	0
Both sides of the arguments have its merits . 	0
But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware . 	0
As you can imagine , if thousands of families use dish-washing machines , how many water and how much electricity will be wasted ! 	0
To start with , because of extensive of using machines , many people loss their job . 	0
Apart from this , using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation . 	0
For example , nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing . 	0
It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me . 	0
Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me . 	0
I don ' t want to disavow the role of luck in success , but as you know it hardly accompany us . 	0
So , for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question . 	0
In summary , even though some people claim the convenience of automobile , I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion . 	1
International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems . 	1
My view is that international aid should be prioritised . 	1
They lack food , water or clothes which keep them warm , not to mention the education needs . 	0
Many people , for example in some African countries , are living below the basic standards . 	0
The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters . 	0
International aid 	0
However , it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located . 	0
Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people . 	0
It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support . 	0
What is worse , people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security , homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members . 	0
Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year . 	1
As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves , heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule . 	0
To quote an instance , in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams . 	0
It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation . 	1
Secondly , scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students ' performance after break . 	0
Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course . 	0
Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers . 	1
I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game . 	0
During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes . 	0
Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly . 	0
Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed . 	0
There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals . 	0
In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff . 	1
When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society , animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned . 	0
I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education . 	1
Zoos should be banned 	0
Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen . 	0
Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals . 	1
In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area . 	0
In conclusion , there is to say that , given the arguments above , we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment , not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions . 	1
This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate . 	0
For example , recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that , till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average . 	0
This not only affects the endangered animals , but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes . 	0
Our behavior causes pollution , which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming . 	0
In addition , a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather . 	1
As a result , further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals . 	0
Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one . 	1
Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . 	0
Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society . 	1
I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs . 	0
Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence 	0
The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . 	0
Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . 	0
Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . 	0
First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . 	0
As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . 	0
Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room . 	0
As a consequence , children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents . 	1
However , have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family ? 	0
I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us . 	1
Television versus Friends and family 	0
We all know that television provides us many benefits ; it helps people relax , helps keep up with news , helps broad our mind . 	0
Gradually , their friends leave them behind either activities or studying . 	0
Secondly , with the rapid change of the standard of life , each family has three or four TV in each room is more common . 	0
First of all , since people watch television too much , they can be isolated from others . 	1
Children , for example , pay more attention on movies , music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others . 	0
To begin with , I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems . 	1
The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology . 	0
In earlier times , for instance , even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities . 	0
Nowadays people , especially inhabitants of cities , are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools . 	0
Recent medical problems and sedentary lifestyle . 	0
It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before . 	1
Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle . 	1
However , while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors , I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact . 	0
Nevertheless , there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems . 	1
Firstly , the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses . 	0
On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . 	1
It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	1
In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . 	0
In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . 	0
In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	0
They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . 	0
The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . 	1
Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages . 	1
Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . 	0
Improved medical care 	0
Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable . 	0
The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system 	0
Firstly , by paying taxes for public school , affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor . 	1
However , I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential . 	1
With the the tax amount for which they pay , the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies , and earn a better quality of life . 	0
It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course . 	0
Obviously , this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation ; therefore , the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue . 	0
Secondly , the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital . 	1
Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them . 	1
In addition , the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials , and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care . 	0
In conclusion , although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working , problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well . 	1
Especially in large population countries , high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability . 	0
They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice . 	0
I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project . 	0
They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features . 	0
The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically . 	0
Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals . 	0
Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class . 	0
In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest . 	0
Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats . 	1
Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife . 	0
They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves . 	0
There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely . 	0
Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction . 	0
Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . 	0
Tax revenue is collected from those who works . 	0
Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority . 	0
Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . 	0
Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless 	0
Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . 	1
However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out . 	1
Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . 	1
If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all . 	0
To give a brief conclusion , Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways . 	1
Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply , hence discovering more cultural traces . 	0
With the help of advanced methods , many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved . 	0
Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers . 	1
Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market . 	0
The research projects like windows opened to the wider world . 	1
Although my university is not in the high-ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects . 	0
It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus . 	0
Secondly , professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities . 	1
Consequently , there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages . 	0
Also , you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together . 	0
Universities positively contribute the professors ' success . 	0
We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin . 	0
With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom . 	0
Last but not least , doing research could also improve the teaching quality . 	1
One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content . 	1
They have a serious impact on people in their puberty . 	0
For example , an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off . 	0
Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture . 	1
Amount of control on media information 	0
Nowadays , one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers , televisions and websites . 	0
It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . 	0
However , I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures . 	1
A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser . 	0
This is actually very environmentally unfriendly . 	0
Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . 	1
The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect 	0
Secondly , the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection . 	1
Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats , which consequently calls for the help of zoos . 	0
Universities are relatively fenced environment . 	0
First of all , doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors . 	0
In addition , by doing research , professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies . 	0
The research projects provide communication with the outside . 	0
These days , more and more university professors are involved in scientific research . 	0
Professors should do more research or teach students ? 	0
However , according to my experiences , professors should be encouraged to mainly do research . 	1
Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching . 	0
He was often invited to do speech in other universities . 	0
I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college . 	0
Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium , it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences . 	0
However , from my point of view , television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other . 	1
Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends 	0
There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost . 	0
Thus , they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives . 	0
One of my friends , for example , once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show " Infinete Challenges " . 	0
To begin with , television shows make people forget what is really important . 	1
One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air . 	0
This is not only about basketball , but also about our friendship , which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other . 	0
That is , watching television alone at home , my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us . 	0
In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . 	0
So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding . 	0
But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . 	0
Some people may be encouraged to do good things . 	0
And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends . 	0
So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . 	1
Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing . 	1
Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . 	0
Old and young workers 	0
What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities . 	0
Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment . 	1
For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life . 	0
Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities . 	1
From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children . 	1
To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides . 	0
It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city ? 	0
Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them . 	0
For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc . However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities . 	0
Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms . 	0
Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . 	0
Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence . 	1
In conclusion , from the above views , although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary , it will bring the higher level of violence . 	1
Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives . 	0
Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . 	0
But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . 	0
And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . 	0
So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . 	1
They will be misleading by those movies . 	0
And they may act like good people in order to get reward . 	0
But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . 	0
I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . 	0
So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs . 	1
Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . 	0
Finally , life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam , traffic accidents and others . 	0
Given these evidences , it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons . 	1
Many people , for example , are suffering from allergy because of these gasses . 	0
Secondly , foods with a low quality such as fast foods , junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively . 	0
For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . 	0
Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . 	0
In order to solve these problems , alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively . 	1
With regard to the former , alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal . 	0
What is worse , traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents . 	0
Thus , the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented . 	1
Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . 	0
As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . 	0
For example , rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries . 	0
This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . 	0
Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis . 	0
Fortunately , some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol , cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries . 	0
We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday . 	0
Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing . 	0
Society should ban all forms of the advertising 	0
It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life . 	0
Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers . 	1
First of all , I do support the idea that advertising alcohol , cigarettes , goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children . 	1
Other critics say that ads have no purpose , they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned . 	0
On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way . 	0
This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers . 	0
Thus , it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations . 	1
Prior to 1980 ' s public places in Sri Lanka , illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely . 	0
To start , non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain . 	1
People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit . 	0
Smoking should be made prohibited in public places 	0
This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers : who are around smoking is taken place . 	0
Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral . 	0
After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public . 	0
Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit , some instances that lead to belligerent incidents . 	0
On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators . 	0
Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal . 	1
Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime . 	0
Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders . 	0
Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type 	0
On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government . 	1
The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place . 	0
Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance " a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction " . 	1
First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime . 	1
Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other . 	1
Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal . 	0
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
Secondly , people can know more about the planet earth itself . 	1
For those reasons , it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research . 	1
While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society . 	1
By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments . 	0
The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching . 	0
To conclude , I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information , which you use , especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence . 	1
The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the " salt-panic " was over . 	0
Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts , especially in the internet , that ' s why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts . 	1
Secondly , it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations , because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . 	0
For example , several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week , because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops . 	0
It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone ' s personal opinion as a source of information , but it was actually wrong . 	0
For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . 	0
If it was not for the space exploration , we would never know these facts . 	0
Why should human beings travel to outer space ? 	0
For many centuries , outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study . 	0
Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful . 	0
However , a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money , to illustrate , astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment . 	0
On the other hand , there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space . 	1
For instance , a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round , not flat . 	0
Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun , not vice versa . 	0
Furthermore , this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future . 	1
In addition to that , the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well . 	0
Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world . 	0
Government and education 	0
Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees . 	1
I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people ; however , for the more higher education like university , the students or their parents should pay for the fees . 	1
It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students ' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education . 	0
In the other hand , I don ' t think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students ' primary and secondary education . 	1
They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves . 	1
Moreover , students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it . 	0
At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way . 	0
Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable . 	1
To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development . 	1
If we don ' t preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct . 	0
To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland . 	0
As we destroy the natural habitat , like forests , jungles and lakes , to make place for our industry and farmland , we rob the ecosystem . 	0
If we don ' t change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet . 	0
First , the natural diversity is very important for further generations . 	1
In my opinion , we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons . 	1
But isn ' t it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet ? 	0
As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing , feeding and industry . 	0
In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now , for the first time in history , is exceeding seven billion . 	0
Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals 	0
Mitigating process , no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home . 	1
In a nutshell , the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable . 	1
I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing . 	0
There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace . 	0
This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers . 	0
For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability . 	0
The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . 	0
The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . 	0
First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . 	1
In conclusion , I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them . 	1
After a while the situation became clear , but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia . 	0
For example , Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia , however , european news announced that it was initiated by Russia . 	0
Nowadays information plays an important role in our world . 	0
Gossip-based information 	0
Some people say : " information is power " . 	1
It has become a product , which can be sold , bought , or stolen . 	0
I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons . 	0
That ' s why it is so important to be well-informed . 	0
Some people may disinform you on purpose , that ' s why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information . 	0
The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability . 	1
So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome . 	0
Study achievements depend on a range of various factors , one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying . 	0
Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone 	0
As for me , I favor the latter because of the following reasons . 	0
In particular , we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone . 	0
Being by nature introvert , I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people . 	0
To begin with , type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one . 	0
Therefore , my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper . 	1
Once , when I was working on presentation with strangers , I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people . 	0
In other words , I must not divide tasks and duties between team members , share responsibility and benefits , and spend time on teambuilding . 	0
Furthermore / moreover , working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork . 	1
Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment . 	0
This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . 	0
Nevertheless , I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology , and technology is not the root cause of the gap . 	0
To some extent , the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology , because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products , and these products can help them to earn more in return . 	1
Under proper use of technology , the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it . 	1
In conclusion , the good technology bringing to us is undeniable . 	1
Nowadays , we can talk with our friends online , no matter where we are and how far between us . 	0
In the past time , we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us . 	0
Undoubtedly , everything has two sides and technology is not an exception . 	0
In addition , the Internet gives everyone access to the same information , this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals . 	0
Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net . 	1
Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures . 	1
To sum up , although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc . Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way . 	1
By way of conclusion , it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases . 	1
However , discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished . 	0
They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life . 	0
It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive . 	0
Technology , in the past two hundred years , has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society , such as telecommunications , manufacturing and buildings , etc . Certainly , technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives . 	0
Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor ? 	0
Personally , I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons . 	0
However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor . 	0
About ten years ago , mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country , only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one . 	0
In the first instance , the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products . 	0
Thus , most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements , especially the poor people . 	1
Today , mobile phones become a common one of household items , which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies . 	0
With the development of Internet , we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day . 	0
Secondly , technical developments improve productivity , which help people to escape from daily chores , and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life . 	1
I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house . 	0
The traffic in the city was too crowed . 	0
Last week , I went to the city center to meet my friends . 	0
We have large streets but few cars , so we can move easily to anywhere . 	0
In conclusion , I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places . 	1
There were a lot of people so the environment can ' t be keep clean . 	0
I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time , and I realize that the environment in some place isn ' t clean and fresh like my home town . 	0
I also love the environment in here . 	1
Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic , people and of course the environment . 	1
If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam . 	0
You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck , even if you be a very lucky . 	0
Finally , you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way . 	0
Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam . 	0
These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his / her work . 	0
The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance . 	1
In the end , I think any great success need great work not great luck , even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans . 	1
Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works . 	0
Therefore , past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times . 	1
Secondly , people ' s success in the past is as significant as those mistakes . 	1
As everyone ' s life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare , we all should learn about other ' s mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones . 	0
Each mistake , from the smallest to the bigger one , is a treasure of experience , which , if we can make full use of , will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life . 	0
Although it is true that life changes rapidly , there are many things in the past that we can learn about , such as mistakes , success and knowledge in many fields of study . 	1
First of all , the predecessors ' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past . 	0
Success and knowledge 	0
Many people think that " Past has nothing to do with present , as time never stops , the next generations are completely different from the predecessors " . 	0
If the predecessors ' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals , others ' accomplishment can be served as the direct way . 	0
By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets , we have the chance to make those mine , put them into practice and , of course , be successful like them . 	0
In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . 	0
They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . 	0
In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity . 	1
After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again . 	0
He do a lot of exercise in football field every day , so it is not for which he is luckier than me . 	0
Moreover , we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful . 	1
I mean , when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success . 	0
For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal . 	0
Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty . 	0
But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me . 	0
I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth . 	1
If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money . 	0
That also make money flow , and then economics become better . 	0
It benefits to a certain country . 	1
In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives . 	1
On the other hand by advertising companies , businesses , firms and individuals promote their goods and services . 	1
Thanks to ads we learn about new products , we can compare them and choose what ’ s the best for us . 	0
These days , not only many businesses , but also governments have to rely on advertising . 	1
For example , tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic ' s economy . 	0
In order to promote the country ' s attractions , the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers . 	0
Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country . 	0
In conclusion , I think that modern society needs advertising . 	1
Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services , but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way . 	1
Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ? 	0
When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . 	0
But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . 	0
However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life . 	1
In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas . 	1
Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains . 	0
Nevertheless , opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates . 	1
Distance-learning vs . attending school in person 	0
A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible , or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees . 	0
From my perspective , online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions . 	1
To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . 	1
In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . 	0
Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . 	0
Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . 	0
Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . 	1
However , other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing . 	0
In my opinion , the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons . 	1
For a long time , the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals . 	0
At a higher level , it is of university students ' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings , which otherwise would not be at hand . 	0
This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels . 	0
First of all , the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners . 	1
With zoos , pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of , for instance , a lion or a crocodile . 	0
For instance , further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths , as per the ministry of health . 	0
In addition to this , introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing . 	1
After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka , it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement . 	1
As this shows , smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country ' s healthcare systems . 	0

Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders , it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens . 	1
By solving the problems in the home country , it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth . 	0
Another reason is that , even within the most developed countries , there are still poor people who lack their basic needs . 	0
In conclusion , people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary . 	1

Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities ' s environment , but laws protect drivers to do so , and accordingly , charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction . 	1
