These days , millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure . 	0
It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people , particularly for the lower income group . 	1
In recent years , many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights . 	0
Cheap air travel should be encouraged ? 	0
Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged , I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem . 	1
People have various different views about cheap air travel . 	0
Moreover , travels also help to promote the tourist industry development , boost the economy and job markets of many countries . 	1
They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge , and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds . 	0
Apparently , more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it . 	0
Because I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
In conclusion , experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person . 	1
This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . 	0
Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . 	0
These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person . 	1
Moreover , these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life . 	0
Besides , experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health . 	0
In other word , tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction , which exploit the best out of its own potential . 	0
Secondly , even though environmental damage is inevitable , it is not tourism to be blamed for . 	0
First of all , tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be . 	1
Basically , places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas , of which economy , before their appearance , haven ' t blossmed yet . 	0
Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up . 	0
It will , by all means , attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents . 	0
Tourism : good or bad ? 	0
Tourism , since its first appearance a long time ago , can be described as a controversial celebrity . 	0
Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion , environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places . 	0
However , I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons . 	0
Otherwise , the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday . 	0
The biggest risk is not taking any risk 	0
" The biggest risk is not taking any risk . " 	0
The ones who have a big dream , they need to be brave and dare to live new situations . 	0
It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks , but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong . 	0
Therefore , it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out . 	1
Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . 	1
In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . 	0
In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country . 	0
In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . 	0
Experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live 	0
Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think . 	1
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . 	1
Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers . 	0
However , the current job market affects the decision of universities . 	0
They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission . 	0
Furthermore , university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination . 	0
They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling , teaching , designing etc . Therefore , universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender . 	1
They prefer male staff for night shifts . 	0
For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine . 	0
The job selection criteria are pre decided . 	0
When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help . 	0
It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need . 	0
To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help . 	0
Some of them may have something to offer . 	0
To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help . 	0
They failed to give me any useful solutions . 	0
In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will . 	1
He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly . 	0
I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives . 	0
This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help . 	1
People will spend less time on cooking food 	0
However , I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food . 	1
The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time . 	0
There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . 	0
Actually , in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework . 	0
As a result , people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years . 	0
Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion 	0
Recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation . 	0
Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . 	0
In my opinion , I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced . 	1
In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . 	0
Firstly , an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution . 	0
Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air , the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants . 	0
Therefore , it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles . 	1
Secondly , an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion . 	0
Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while . 	0
In other words , I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face . 	1
Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite . 	1
Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us . 	0
It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words . 	0
Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent . 	0
It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . 	0
One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . 	0
He heard lots of " no " , furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams . 	0
It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . 	1
To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . 	0
To conclude , in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations . 	1
Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to , it is necessary to have courage to take risks , be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life . 	1
The reasons to be illustrated are follows . 	0
However , from my perspective , students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam . 	1
For example , I love Physics . 	0
Firstly , the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject . 	1
Though out the last decade , the load of the university students has been constantly increasing . 	0
It is not necessary for university students to attend classes 	0
There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam . 	0
There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam . 	0
And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics . 	0
But I don ' t like electronics , because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world . 	0
They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also . 	0
For example , nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky . 	0
This factor is still affecting thinking of many people . 	0
Contrastingly , in the past time , women worked at home and performed sophisticated work . 	0
Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field . 	0
Gender Equality at university admission 	0
Initially , if we look into the fact , women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor . 	0
Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders . 	1
This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender . 	0
They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only . 	0
We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present . 	1
What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media . 	1
Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen , changes have to be done . 	0
This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted . 	1
If finally he is proven innocent , he may feel embarrassed to face the public . 	0
It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is ' dug ' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people , his privacy is being jeopardized . 	1
To conclude , I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with . 	1
However , I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well . 	0
Thus , exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision . 	0
As all of us know , juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law . 	0
Not only that , the convicted will also receive a fair action . 	1
By doing so , the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences . 	0
To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . 	0
So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food . 	1
I could adapt this method to use my real life . 	0
All in all , the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture . 	1
If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated . 	0
Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs . 	0
Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination . 	0
While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working . 	0
They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it . 	0
One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969 . 	0
The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society . 	0
When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country . 	0
On the other hand , growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment . 	1
This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	0
Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . 	1
Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . 	0
After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories . 	1
Apartments vs dormitories at university 	0
Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . 	0
You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . 	0
An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . 	0
First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . 	1
While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . 	0
Secondly , it is crucial to keep one ’ s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin . 	0
For instance , children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends . 	0
In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home . 	0
Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism . 	0
Hence , it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important . 	1
To conclude , although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one ’ s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures . 	1
As far as I am concerned , sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society . 	1
There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way . 	1
For example , I could improve the way that I solve problems , improve how I take care of my health , and improve to plan my life for future . 	0
For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . 	0
Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . 	0
For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along . 	0
It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things . 	0
First of all , schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying . 	0
Students may learn professional skills , expand their understandings and gain experiences . 	0
TV has adverse effects on friends and family 	0
I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . 	0
Study at school or get a job ? 	0
Personally , I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school . 	1
Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority . 	1
Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . 	0
Therefore , I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . 	0
Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . 	0
Second of all , schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students . 	0
Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future . 	0
First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . 	1
Others , however , think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job . 	0
So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . 	0
For example , as we know , employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills . 	0
Therefore , they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future . 	1
As I have said , television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening , but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television . 	1
Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family . 	1
However , as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality . 	0
Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves . 	1
Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study . 	0
Consequently , it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time . 	0
Besides , along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities . 	0
Moreover , there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs . 	0
In addition , pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better . 	0
All thing considered , tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact . 	1
In my opinion , the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings . 	1
Not to mention ecotourism , a new kind of environment-friendly service , which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures . 	0
Because of that , tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity . 	1
In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction , the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration . 	0
To be precise , for instance , a fortune is spent on trimming the trees , watering the flowers , preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora , in the hope of beautifying the wild . 	0
There are many different opinions regarding world culture . 	0
Opinions regarding world culture 	0
However , in my view , a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons . 	1
Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . 	0
Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . 	0
Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . 	1
Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . 	1
For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	0
For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . 	0
Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . 	0
When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . 	0
You set your own schedules . 	0
In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	0
This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . 	0
Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . 	0
You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . 	0
The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	0
Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . 	1
A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . 	0
Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . 	0
For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . 	0
Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . 	0
This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . 	0
Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . 	1
Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	0
Honestly , I was in shock ! 	0
I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . 	0
Finally , some people make the television a priority . 	1
When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	0
How she could say that to me ? . 	0
To some extent , it is true . 	0
Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed , thus health and life of eaters is assured . 	0
According to a recent survey , 89% of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on . 	0
Thus , they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal . 	0
As you can see , if the policy of raising salary was supported , the demonstration would not happen . 	0
The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries . 	0
Apart from that , a fair trial can be achieved . 	0
Then , punishment can be given in accordance to the condition . 	0
It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal ' s past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws . 	0
Jury must have access to criminals ' past records 	0
I , for one , agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below . 	0
There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion . 	1
This is because , knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment . 	0
First and foremost , I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal . 	1
The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person . 	0
For instance , take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty . 	0
When I was 14 years old , my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important . 	0
There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone . 	0
Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses . 	0
For example , nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before . 	0
Our youth has become very confident towards his career . 	0
First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school . 	0
Furthermore , children can learn social skills when they have a job . 	0
Overall , I believe that students should study at school . 	1
Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they ' ve earned . 	0
There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job . 	0
Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job , studying at school is always the best choice for children ' s future . 	1
In summary , even though some people claim the convenience of automobile , I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion . 	1
In conclusion , I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators , as there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co-workers , working conditions and professional achievements . 	1
Clearly , although pets aren ' t able to speak with us , we can nonetheless count on them . 	0
Since I was all alone at home for a long time , my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings . 	0
Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way . 	0
Perhaps , no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food , because it affects everybody in their daily lives . 	0
Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . 	0
Thus , it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future . 	1
And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology . 	0
Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported . 	0
However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well . 	1
On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government . 	0
It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society . 	0
Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences . 	0
This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable . 	1
Should government control media crime 	0
The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media . 	1
It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy . 	0
In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure . 	0
Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . 	0
So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use . 	0
When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society . 	0
The use of public transportation make us live more sociable . 	1
Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources . 	1
When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life . 	0
The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air . 	0
They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer . 	0
The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy . 	0
If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted . 	0
The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . 	0
Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . 	1
To sum up , not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind , but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways . 	1
Thus , the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation . 	0
Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . 	0
Way to reduce the amount of traffic ? 	0
Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots . 	0
The problem off traffic overload , caused by overpopulation , has aroused interest of many city planners . 	0
It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock . 	0
However , I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way . 	0
First of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . 	1
Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . 	0
Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . 	0
University education is always an important part of one ' s life . 	0
In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study . 	0
Finally yet importantly , appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class ’ s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments . 	1
However , if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems . 	0
Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points . 	1
First and foremost , I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college . 	1
Also , they can help each other for learning materials better . 	0
On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money . 	0
However , I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option . 	1
Students should attend to classes or it should be optional ? 	0
Nowadays , it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities ( options ) as well . 	0
As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . 	0
The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . 	1
Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . 	0
It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . 	0
In conclusion , city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas . 	1
It is highly recommended to put forward such solution , especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China , with the ever-growing demand for job or education . 	0
Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . 	0
No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . 	0
The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate . 	0
The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts 	0
First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . 	1
While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services , I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society . 	1
However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . 	0
Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . 	0
On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . 	1
There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . 	0
There won ' t be any effect if school does so . 	0
Do arts and music improve the quality of life ? 	0
My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs . 	1
Art is not the key determination of quality of life , but education is . 	1
In order to make people better off , it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens . 	0
This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people ' s lives for a well-rounded social system . 	0
Admittedly , art , to some extent , serve a valuable function about enriching one ' s daily lives , for example , it could bring release one ' s heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work . 	1
However , it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries , in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room . 	0
By comparison to these issues , the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all . 	0
To conclude , art could play an active role in improving the quality of people ' s lives , but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life . 	1
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account . 	1
First , there are several uncertainties about your professional future . 	0
Some of them had no own savings . 	0
As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe . 	0
In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses . 	0
Saving / Spending money 	0
Im my opinion , saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments , neither in your professional nor your personal life , furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams . 	1
But isn ' t it better to save your money for later investments or rough times ? 	0
In addition , you can not be sure about the development in your personal life . 	0
They could not afford the rent , so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence . 	0
There was news about raising professors ' salary in my country . 	0
As for me , I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country . 	1
Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted . 	0
More convincing 	0
There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity . 	0
Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . 	0
After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . 	0
I favor the former ; that is , I agree that face-to-face communication is better . 	1
The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing . 	0
He once complained a service of a restaurant . 	0
Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it . 	0
Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication . 	0
For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . 	0
Secondly , pets are useful for a variety of things . 	1
High-salary instructors don ' t teach students harder because they earn more money . 	0
This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly . 	0
To improve education , spending more money to raise professors ' salary is inappropriate . 	1
Besides , the ultimate purpose is to change , to motivate students to be better . 	0
Some professors don ' t deserve the money at all , then , what ' s the point to spend money on them ? 	0
In addition , will the university filter all the professors overall ? 	0
Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on . 	0
The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution . 	1
The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society . 	1
Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources 	0
So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it . 	0
Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community . 	1
Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move . 	0
The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out . 	1
Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person . 	0
If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly . 	0
And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again . 	0
But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics . 	0
And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics . 	0
Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach . 	0
Secondly , if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated . 	1
And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam . 	0
And the students will have nothing to do in the campus . 	0
If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes . 	0
The academic achievement will decline . 	0
Then he or she will play online games days and nights . 	0
Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me . 	0
Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help . 	1
Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other . 	0
We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games . 	0
We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends . 	0
I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . 	0
Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . 	1
It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . 	0
You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together . 	0
Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . 	0
I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment . 	0
Furthermore , the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well . 	1
The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably . 	0
With adequate local facilities and services available , they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing . 	0
In addition , both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before , and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations . 	0
In conclusion , the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale . 	1
Although there are some inevitable problems , they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken . 	1
What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities . 	0
Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment . 	1
For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life . 	0
Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities . 	1
From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children . 	1
To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides . 	0
It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city ? 	0
Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them . 	0
For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc . However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities . 	0
Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms . 	0
Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . 	1
For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . 	0
Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . 	1
For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . 	0
Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . 	0
I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
So that , I can have a good health . 	0
This experience teach me to aware my health . 	0
Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . 	0
This food are not have chemical . 	0
To sum up , I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above , namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations . 	1
So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal . 	1
They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations . 	0
Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer . 	0
For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . 	0
Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . 	0
In order to solve these problems , alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively . 	1
With regard to the former , alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal . 	0
What is worse , traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents . 	0
Thus , the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented . 	1
Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . 	0
As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . 	0
For example , rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries . 	0
This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . 	0
Also , attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success . 	1
The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture . 	0
When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures . 	0
On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs . 	1
However , the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times . 	0
Through this way , they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study . 	0
On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials . 	1
Moreover , teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it . 	1
On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination . 	1
As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country . 	0
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car . 	0
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings . 	1
Finally , with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams . 	0
He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it . 	0
For instance , I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend . 	0
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished . 	1
Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time . 	1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning . 	1
I list my reasons as follows . 	0
Classroom learnng vs online education 	0
There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . 	0
For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . 	0
Finally I got 1st rank in final exam . 	0
First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . 	1
In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . 	0
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up . 	0
However , the biggest concern is the effect on global warming . 	0
In conclusion , I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits . 	1
In fact , while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories , nothing is being done to reins the airlines . 	0
Instead , people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices . 	0
However , it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive . 	0
For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual , full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture . 	0
When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one . 	0
Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not ? 	0
Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively . 	0
By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment . 	0
A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer . 	0
Thus , students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning . 	0
That is to say , students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve . 	0
In my school , the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby . 	0
For me , I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment . 	0
It ' s unpleasant to stay at school . 	0
However , coffee shops are not always quiet , so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly . 	0
That ' s why education in university is discussed all the time . 	0
What is the best way to orientate the students ? 	0
I ' m against providing more money to professors 	0
The professors are essential , however , the schools are established for students . 	1
Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources , which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors . 	1
Raising the salaries of professors so ? 	0
I would say no . 	0
The following are my opinions . 	0
To begin with , the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors . 	1
To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory . 	1
Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . 	0
It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career . 	0
Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . 	0
You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . 	0
In result you learn quickly . 	1
For example , I have my personal experience . 	0
For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster . 	0
It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning . 	1
From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons . 	1
Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
That ' s the main reason I against providing more money to professors . 	1
Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition . 	0
At school , students are priority . 	0
Students ' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university . 	1
Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . 	0
These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one ’ s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more . 	0
Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential . 	1
People moved due to a number of reasons , namely better educations or higher salary jobs . 	0
Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries ’ cultures . 	0
More people are migrating to other countries than ever before 	0
The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries . 	0
Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues . 	0
Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values . 	0
However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values . 	1
Firstly , maintaining one ’ s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments . 	0
Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net . 	1
Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures . 	1
To sum up , although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc . Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way . 	1
Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties . 	0
Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries . 	0
Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture . 	1
Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism . 	1
Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . 	0
It makes you perfect in time management skills . 	1
Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click , such as science reports , study posts , documentary records , etc . A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course . 	0
It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication , mental inspiration and physical educations . 	1
Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer 	0
With the tremendous development in information technology , long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school . 	0
Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate . 	0
From my perspective , I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education . 	1
To begin with , studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense . 	1
Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time , tuition fees , textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection . 	0
This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line . 	0
Besides that , long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches . 	1
Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation , international tourism has boomed in the last few decades . 	0
Based on these grounds , it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources , and it should not be encouraged . 	0
To sum up , new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures . 	1
For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . 	0
In fact , new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world . 	1
Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . 	1
This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	0
In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . 	0
This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . 	0
Sometimes , face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle . 	0
Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits . 	0
Problems and benefits of international tourism 	0
In order to meet the needs of tourists , local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions , which may result in the destruction of natural habitats . 	0
In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . 	0
Factor of choosing a career . 	0
To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . 	1
Nevertheless , while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor , I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard . 	1
People , for instance , who don ' t like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . 	0
However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work-place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . 	0
Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . 	0
In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position . 	0
For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries . 	0
In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . 	1
Whether children can learn a lot at school , there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future . 	0
Nevertheless , it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job . 	1
To illustrate this point , I can write about my own experience . 	0
We can talk to them because they listen to us , more than some people will ever do . 	0
Some people think that pets should be treated like family members . 	0
Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds , tortoises and fishes as well . 	0
Pets have always been essential in our society . 	0
Our useful friends 	0
Similarly to friends , indeed , they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone . 	0
First , pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are . 	1
The issue is controversial but in my opinion , pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons . 	1
However , others argue that they are just animals and aren ' t able to think like us . 	0
Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication . 	1
However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . 	0
Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication . 	0
For instance , I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric . 	0
If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important . 	0
Therefore , we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way . 	1
Finally , I realized that his facebook account was stolen . 	0
Hence , from this case , we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face . 	1
He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore . 	0
I just shocked and did not know what happened . 	0
Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . 	1
If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate . 	1
This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help . 	1
Each makes different decisions . 	0
Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons . 	0
Living with a roommate is better than Living alone 	0
Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone . 	0
This means you can get more for less . 	0
For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . 	0
In conclusion , I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future . 	1
However , distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency , convenience and economic value , but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose . 	1
These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils ' personalities . 	0
But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies , remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts . 	0
To conclude , I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject . 	1
However , flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy . 	1
Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . 	0
I disagree with this view . 	0
Tourism also creates more pollution and waste , including growing emission of greenhouse gases , dumped leftovers and overuse of water , power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels . 	0
I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment . 	1
For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place . 	0
On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions . 	1
I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates . 	1
International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding 	0
Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . 	0
There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area . 	1
Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . 	0
Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . 	0
Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant . 	0
For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . 	0
But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points . 	0
All in all , the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated . 	1
In the end , this student will become a loser in the world . 	0
And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class . 	0
This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system . 	0
Admittedly , the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not . 	1
