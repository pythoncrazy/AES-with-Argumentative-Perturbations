In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

Our inclusion criteria define this article , not the title ( which was recently changed with explicit assurances that people would not immediately set in with pointed and disruptive additions ) . 	0
Or , better yet , we might consider following WP : RS and require that our sources be " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " ( emphasis in original ) , with a little WP : WEIGHT thrown in to cover disagreement among sources . 	0

So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0
In my view , changing from ' sect ' to ' church ' is a POV push . 	0

In fact , we are obliged to do that by WP : BLP . 	0
Different people will look at the same quote and they will link it in different ways . 	0

I would like you to reconsider your views . 	0
That should already tell you that linking from within quotes is inherently problematic . 	0

I ' ve been reviewing the article and for the most part it ' s pretty solid . 	0

Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

However , terms like denialism , misrepresentation and distortion are how main view scientists have received theories differing from HIV causing AIDS . 	0
The issue at hand , if one is going to give any lip service to dissent , is the fact that some * scientists * dissent . 	0
So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0

" Mythical " is a compromise , but I think it ' s a fairly accurate one , in that there are without question many myths involving Santa Claus . 	1

It is fiction , but it has added * stuff * to the myths surrounding Santa Claus ( the sleigh that only works if people believe in Santa Claus , for instance ) . 	0

Joe407 , consensus or no consensus - the gallery can ' t use images by famous israeli photographers without giving them due credit . 	0
I saw today an image of female soldiers saluting at a memorial service which looked too " good " to be the work of an amateur photographer and indeed . . 	0

I simply propose adding 200 words that reflect Lederer ' s article , which is cited at length on the Denialism page , so how controversial can it be ? 	0

Private property is increasingly under attack in South Africa due to squatters that take over entire buildings , farms , etc . . . 	0

Also , as for the ANC being a freely and fairly elected party do you have any idea what ' necklacing ' is and what it entails ? 	0
F . W . said that he didn ' t want to raise the issue of voter fraud due to his concerns that it might spark a civil war . 	0
Furthermore they actually have their own variety of Zimbabwe style " land reform " which they call " willing seller , willing buyer " along the lines of what Namibia does . 	0
They have elections but nothing ever changes and the ruling party always manages to receive a conveniently large majority of the votes . 	0
Nominally South Africa is a capitalist democracy , in actuality it is more in line with communist tyranny . 	0
Courts are very reluctant to evict these people since they seem to believe that the so-called " landless people " have a right to acquire the property of others . 	0
You certainly cannot sell your farm to foreigners . 	0
You are not free to sell your farm to anybody who wants to buy it , you must first let the government make an offer , which is a below market offer , and if you refuse you are not allowed to sell it . 	0

Sorry for unclear expression , " no problem with affricates " means " I know , how affricates are articulated generally ( not in Basque only ) , no need to explain them especially " , answering to " The forms with t - represent the corresponding affricates " . 	0

The CNN article said that : " Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells . 	0
Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0
At minimum this statement should be seperated into two statements to make it more accurate . 	0
If Israel were sincerely concerned about peace and minimizing civilian casualties , it would end the siege in Gaza and negotiate with the Palestinian resistance . 	0
The fact that Israel dropped bombs on civilian areas in one of the most densely populated regions of the world is overwhelming evidence that the intent was to kill civilians . 	1

I really really like the new Inquisition paragraph . 	0
This is such an important paragraph to have in this article because it is something that has been used as anti-Catholic propaganda for centuries and historians are in agreement that it has been a tool of misinformation even to the present day . 	1
If we have so many top historians in agreement on this subject , wow , wont Wikipedia be a nice tool of information now ! 	0
I also agree with Nautical Mongoose ' s deletion of the additions made to the Jesus section that I too , thought were inappropriate . 	0
If we , not being a primary source , have no information on whether this is verifiable , nor any information on a pending court date , then we have no business reporting it per WP : CRYSTAL BALL . 	0

I have a screen shot of the prophet as depicted inside the hall of the Super Best Friends . 	0
It should be noted that in episode 4 of season 5 depicted Muhammad and the episode aired with not a single threat or statement that I could find . 	0
I think this point should be included as part of the controversy surrounding the more recent episodes . 	0
SouthParkStudios . com no longer streams the episode in question or clips from that episode . 	0
Would saying that work for you ? 	0
Nothing there worthy of including in an encyclopedia . 	1

But attacking a military target that was placed in the civilian population is allowed , even if civilian are hurt . 	0
I never said the " civilian populations " are " military targets " . 	0
Terrorist tactics have nothing to do with " opposing Israel " . 	0
But as clearly evidenced by the casualty figures , Israel makes extreme efforts to avoid killing civilians , while Hamas states that is their goal . 	1
That includes the PLO , Hezbollah and several others in the Arab-Israeli conflict , but many , many other organizations throughout the world ( like Tamil Tigers , IRA , Japanese Red Army , and others whose names I don ' t know ) . 	0
The UN ' s initial claims caused worldwide outrage , condemnation of Israel , fighting and rioting , and they were right in the middle of it , with even Secretary Ban condemning Israel for something it didn ' t do . 	0

people say different things at different times and its here that we discuss it and log it . do you really think that this article should change according to the last ever quote of AM regarding the holocaust ? 	0
if so i think youll find your argument failing . 	0
And this article clearly states that he said that and claimes so . however , since erasing the past is not possible , the claim he made at 2005 is still denial . 	1
if you wish to open a section right after the section about holocaust denial that reads " AM States the holocaust did in fact happen " and link sources that support it you are welcome . 	0
Hamas makes no pretense of targeting the military - blowing up in a bus or restaurant in the middle of a city has no military purpose , just a civilian purpose . 	0

Your version has a problem or two , namely that it was the administrative sub-division called Northern Ireland that opted out , the extent of which was supposed to be determined by the ill-fated Boundary Commission . 	1
No , BrownHairedGirl ' s . 	0
That Northern Ireland remained comprised of six of Ulster ' s counties ( and not more or less of them ) was due to the failure of the Boundary Commission , but your wording tends to present this as a fait accompli . 	0

These combined with the fact that Parker and Stone are on record stating that Butters has become a main character is reason enough to include him as such in the article . 	0
If someone is O / C enough to time it I think that you would find that , in the last several seasons , his onscreen time pretty much equals any of the other four . 	0
The Imaginationland three parter has Butters front and center as an important part of the storyline . 	0
When Kenny was killed off Butters was brought forward as the fourth friend . 	0

I dont think you can call a group a terrorist organization in WP ' s narrative voice . 	0
I would not be opposed to saying they have a militant wing that has carried out terrorist attacks , but I would be opposed to calling that wing " terrorist " . 	0
But here is one source that calls it an " Islamic militant resistance organization " . 	0
Here is another one that says " Hamas is first and foremost a resistance organization " . 	0
I have a problem calling the organization terrorist , I dont have a problem saying that they have committed terrorist attacks . 	1
Terrorism is a tactic that can describe individual attacks without issue . 	0
( ec ) There are also sources that call it a resistance organization that fights Israeli occupation . 	0
They claimed for many days that IDF bombed the school , and when they were proven wrong - the bombing was outside the school - they claimed that ' s what they said all along , which is a complete and utter lie . 	0

How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0

The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0
