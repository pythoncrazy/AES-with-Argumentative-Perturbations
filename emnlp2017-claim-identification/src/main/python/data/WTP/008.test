The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
I don ' t think that Wassupwestcoast ' s rewrite of the abuse scandal section is an improvement . 	1

Galileo when facing the consensus of the " mainstream " view that the earth was the center of the universe was correct to disagree and present his evidence contradicting the accepted view of how things were . 	0

News paper evidence here of the First Vision ' s presence in young Smith ' s community ( and pre-1900 ' s Mormonism ) is relevant because it allows the reader a better opportunity to understand the basis of Mormonism for themselves . 	0

Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0

This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0
Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues . 	0

I agree that the Catholic Church did a lot more good than bad ( and still does ) . 	0
I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0

Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U .

Now , since neither U . S . / israel claim that thier intention is to target civilian populations , we cannot choose to believe one , while dismissing the other . 	1

I realize I will have to support my edit to others , but seeing the extent of your contributions to the " israel " wiki page , I don ' t want to have this discussion with you all over again in another place . 	0
If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . . " statement to a more appropriate section in the article and don ' t get any opposition from you , then it would be more in line with the method used on the " israel " wiki page . 	0
I even like the wording used right now . . . . . . but . . . . in comparing it to the " israel " wiki page , it just makes sense to have it positioned in a different area . . . . . will you oppose this ? 	0
I don ' t feel it should be removed , quite the contrary , there is quite the evidence and references that this is a common view held by international politics about Hamas , and therefore should be included in the " Hamas " page . . . . 	0

That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0

Kenosis above writes : First off , this is not properly a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by somebody at some point in time for all of history , but rather is properly presented as a list of topics that are characterized a pseudoscience in light of current , or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method . 	0

Smith , according to his own account , told local clergy about the First Vision and was mocked and scorned over the pulpit in his own community shortly after it had happened . 	1
If his own accounts are not enough , his mother ' s journal , as well as other sources including local newspapers all support this idea . 	0
I still believe that the newspaper articles are appropriate to the discussion specifically because they challenge certain preconceived notions about pre-1900 Mormonism . 	1
Dismissing one academic because one has supposedly taken a class and considers him to be less " mainstream " than the current thought does not change his academic credentials . 	0

My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0

Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

Any relation to Kermit Jagger from the joke , do you think ? 	0

( edit conflict ) I agree with SarekOfVulcan - proper grammar demands two commas ( for a parenthetical phrase ) or zero commas ( for a compound modifier ) . 	0
The original wording was off base , as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina . 	0
Actually , The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source , in almost all areas . 	0
Katrina was a natural disaster , which federal and state governments are largely responsible for aid and cleanup . 	0
Although there is surely room to be critical of the Obama administration for various reactions . 	0
Like I indicated , there is valid criticism , but it ' s probably has more to do with appearances than actual responsibility . 	1
The oil spill was a result of an entity ( BP ) , and by law BP was supposed to have a plan in place for situations just like the current one . 	0

The plans were later shelved following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the worst oil spill in US history . " 	1
It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1
It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
Works for me . 	0
Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

ALl that matters is that we quote reliable / verifiable sources correctly , if they use the term , we should , if they don ' t , we shouldn ' t . 	0
And , to quote further , " The biggest compliance problem the auditors discovered was training children to protect themselves from abuse . 	0
For example , USA Today - Church sex abuse costs skyrocket 07 March 2008 , which says in part that , to quote : " . . . hadn ' t reported abuse claims to civil authorities until after the lapse was discovered in the audit . " 	0

I dont think it detracts from the article to have this in here - it just shows the weakness of the opposing opinion and I prefer to have this exposed . 	0
To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0

While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
