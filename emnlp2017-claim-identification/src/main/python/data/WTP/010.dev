I view Smith ' s 1838 personal history as a good source for explaining what he said happened to him . ) 	0
( My only point was that Smith and his family were Christians at the time of the First Vision , and from his own report he apparently was attempting to decide whether he should join the Methodists , the Presbyterians , or some other Christian sect . 	0
I ' m sorry , I ' m not following you at all . 	0

However , notice that both theories complement each other . 	0
If there was a universal common ancestor , then evolution would produce all current biodiversity we see today from this organisms . 	0
Again , notice that argueing for biodiversity we use evolutionary forces . 	0
Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0
So different lines of evidence are used to attack each question . 	0
Two different lines of evidence that fit rather nicely into the theory of evolution . 	0

No one said the LDS website was primary , and if you wish to consider it primary then the AAF would be secondary . 	0
Whether a source is secondary or primary is subject to the individual . 	0
If we follow the logic stated by JohnBlackBurne we ' d be left in the article with little more than readers opinions and very little works cited . 	0
The AFF , a foundation dedicated to research about the Book of Mormon would be much more reliable than JohnBlackburne ' s opinion . 	0
For those who view the statement as bias , remember that it is also a quote , which is different than statements in the article . 	1
Please see first paragraph again , and please post another reliable source if you wish to dispute the fact . 	0
For reference , please review other articles that use quotes in their article . 	0
By quoting other sources instead of just writing without quotes , this alerts to the reader that the quote is different than the other statements in that it may come from a bias source ( which is not saying a source is necessarily bias ) , and so dissipates any hidden bias which keeps with the neutrality of the article . 	0

That it later became the de facto GNU kernel for approximately everyone in the community is an important note for the Linux article , which discusses the larger aspect of actually using the kernel to do some work , but it ' s not so directly relevant to the history of the kernel that it deserves a place in the intro . 	0
The Linux kernel wasn ' t developed to fill in the missing gap in the GNU project . 	0
It does belong here in this article more than a passing reference to a " vision " because it is the basis for this so called Restorationist Movement of Christianity . 	1
As for the Newspaper articles , I have had long discussions with some that claim that Smith and the early members of the Church of Christ never claimed such a thing until the middle 1840 ' s and that there is no proof to the contrary . 	0
I have repeatedly added it to this article that is sadly lacking in the area of relevant substance for the foundations of Mormonism or the LDS Movement . 	0
This better explains some of the later persecutions of Smith and the movement . 	0
Also , I believe it is important to show the impact of these events on Smith ' s community . 	0

Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0

The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we ' re talking about . 	0
where ' s the controversy ? 	0
And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0

I think with proper attribution and context ( historical , academic , etc . ) , we can include items which even in our heart of hearts know are not pseudoscientific and there won ' t be any NPOV problems with this article . 	0
Being included in this list means not that the item is pseudoscientific , but rather that it has the unique distinction of having been called pseudoscientific by some notable source . 	0
Please feel free to pick everything I say apart for analysis and I ' d be happy to go over it with you even further .   : - ) - - 	0
But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands . 	0

If a reliable source describes a person or group using one of these words , then the description must be attributed in the article text to its source , preferably by direct quotation , and always with a verifiable citation . " both views ( terrorist and resistance ) are notable but they need to be attributed . 	1
per wp : terrorist , the note on this very talkpage says that words like terrorist and freedom fighter are " inherently non-neutral , so they should not be used as unqualified labels in the voice of the article . 	0
As far as wikipedia policy goes , you won ' t find anything to support renaming the article Israel occupation force . 	0
For those who are unaware , the vast majority of the Israeli army are stationed in Israeli-proper , not the West Bank or the Golan . 	0
So was the IDF known as the " IOF " because the " occupation " began between 1948-1967 ? 	0
The " IOF " , IMO ( obviously ) is simply another buzzword designed to villify and demonize the Israeli army . 	0
So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0

Shlomi ' s right that the earth won ' t overheat so long as it can continue to radiate in infrared into space , but there are mechanisms for trapping heat on earth - the greenhouse effect is the major one , and in our case , the biosphere is another obvious one . 	1
It ' s not quite correct to treat the Earth as a blackbody , since the atmosphere has a confounding effect - we might say that the Earth acts as a blackbody above the level of the atmosphere , but actually the amount of radiation emitted is inconsistent with the surface temperature of earth . 	1
It would be a yes or a no situation - or as I say above - it would be a black-or-white situation . 	0
Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0

The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1

I think the idea is to have a broad representation of source material . 	1
My sources are Catholic Church approved third party published sources . 	0
" One Faith , One Lord " written for young adults and new converts , it is a summary of basic Catholic belief . 	0
There are no Wikipedia policies that would require elimination of either of these sources I have used to create the Beliefs section . 	0
Your own post on the page is doing the exact opposite of what you have just quoted . 	0
And all three of those points can be obeyed perfectly as long as no assumptions are made in regard to the outcome or anything not known . 	0
In theory that is all good , but they did it for Heath , so why not Rihanna ? 	0
The Constitution does not require that one follow any specific religion to be president . 	0
Muslims , Catholics , Protestants , Jews , and others can be President . 	1
None is any more shameful than another . 	0
Inaccurate reporting , such as calling a President a Jew or a Muslim , is not right . 	0
The musicians I mentioned ( I actually forgot to mention Sebastian Bach as well ) not only cite Zeppelin as an influence , but have called Zep a metal band ( Åkerfeldt called them a metal band here for instance . ) 	0
You miss took what I said about bands citing them . 	0
I still stand by " Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band " . 	0
I agree . 	0
But with all the biased editors no progress will ever be made in making the articles impartial . 	0

Of course sentimental patriots among homesick members of the Lebanese diaspora just love to hear about their intrepid and successful Phoenician ancestors — and so much like the modern Lebanese themselves , needless to say . . . " Popular " indeed , in every sense . 	0
In my youth , so far from being homogeneous , Lebanon was the only genuinely cosmopolitan society in that region . 	0
We have an issue over the meaning of " minority " ? 	0

Wikipedia cannot compensate for the inequities of justice systems the world over . 	0
Too bad . 	0
Why don ' t you write out the full statement you would like to see in the article and then we can see what we are looking at . 	0
Always best to do that , I think . 	0
It is so hard to try and keep up with all of the issues regarding the " fight " soo in lieu I just started a new section for it completely , and therefore , conversing can be continued following , and singularily regarding the " fight " . 	0

From following the links , it becomes obvious that Obama mis-identified his 4th-grade school as being a Muslim school , when it is a secular school at which he did read the Koran ( and make faces while doing so . . . . ) 	0
One year of taking a class on the Koran at the age of 10 is far different than attending a school dedicated to Islam . 	0

Unomi , please see the passage by Cioffi which I added to the psychoanalysis entry . 	0
Equating unfalsifiability with pseudoscience is problematic . 	1

The current ( Republican ) constitutional system dates from 1994 though the constitution itself dates from 1996 . 	0
The example of France is a good comparison : The area of the Roman Empire called Gaul became a separate entity by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 . 	0
Then a whole bunch of wars and revolutions later , the current 5th Republic was established in 1958 . 	0
The article List of countries by formation dates confuses three entirely separate concepts . 	0
" Current form of government " , " formation of a country as a separate entity " and " aquisition of sovereignty / independence " . 	0
South Africa became a country in 1910 with limited sovereignty as a British Dominion , this was modified by the Statute of Westminster . 	0
It became a Republic ( but kept the Westminster parliamentary form of government ) in 1961 . 	0
I agree with user Levine2112 who states that it looks like a POV-fork if we restrict the inclusion criteria . 	0
A major organization ( even if it is a " science fiction religion " ) has characterized the topic as pseudoscience . 	0
Can ' t we just state WHO characterized it as pseudoscience ? 	0

I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1
That sentence is also in the Beliefs section under subsection " church " . 	0
I dont have an opinion on whether we keep it in the lead or not . 	0
Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0
It ' s just that South Africa , as it exists today , began in 1910 . 	0
He just wanted the Shah out . " . 	0
These credible sources cannot simply be pulled out my ass 	0
Additional interpretation from the guardian link above : " The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah ' s regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel . 	0
This isn ' t a value judgement on what came before , nor does it deny that other countries existed in the area before then ( the ZAR is one example ) . 	0
Please also remember that the current paragraph is wikilinked to an extensive Wikipedia article devoted to the subject of preist sex abuse . 	0

Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0

Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0
The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
