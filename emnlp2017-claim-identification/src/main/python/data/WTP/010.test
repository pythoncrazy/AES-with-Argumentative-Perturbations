Nancy ' s extreme POV and disdain for the Latin Mass is getting in the way of the facts , again . - - 	0

So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0

If you treat the entire strip as an urban area ( a very reasonable thing to do ) , it would rank about 513th on that list . 	0
If you count Gaza as a state , it truly is one of the densest , but we ' re talking urban areas here . 	0
Could you please provide a source for that claim ? 	0
My data seem to disagree with that - see , for example , here , page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th , and that ' s counting the Gaza city area , not the entire strip , yielding a much higher density of 16 , 450 / km2 . 	1
Compared to other cities and urban areas around the world , there ' s nothing special about Gaza . 	1

The thing here in my view is that these need to be valid possibilities that have been conjectured by someone whose opinion is relevant ( for one example , a former White House protocol officer ) . 	0
I see no grounds for arguing against this view unless one has poor command of the English language ( or is a creationist ) . 	0
I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
they are not . 	0
That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0
Roland was quite right to point out that facts and theories are different . 	0
Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0
Whether his conclusions are correct or not , or shared by anyone else , needs to be contextualised , but claims such as these by Montagnier need to appear in the article . 	1
It can be contextualised , countered by others , etc , but it must be mentioned . 	0
Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1
Whether he ' s going off the deep end or not in our opinion is not important , what ' s important is a good article that fully and accurately covers and the topic . 	0
Montagnier is indisputably a reliable source himself , as one who is " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " . 	0
Some feel that only conclusions accepted in peer reviewed journals deserve a mention , others realise there ' s a much bigger picture . 	0

Mk5384 , you have expressed your justification for the comma , and others have explained the context in which a comma would be appropriate and the grammatical reason for why a comma where you have suggested one would require a second comma . 	0
The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1

While no one , except mostly reality show stars , become famous / notable for their personal lives , I do not believe that it ' s trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia . 	1
But , really , I do not see the Personal life sections as that different than the Early life sections , except for the fact that the Early life sections deal with a person ' s early personal life . . . while the other deals with the person ' s later personal life . 	0
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about " the incident " pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section . 	0

However , I would like to float a compromise addition to the Denialism section , which carefully contrasts skepticism ( Root-Bernstein ) and denialism ( Duesberg ) , drawing on Lederer ' s nuanced article that explores diverse viewpoints and explains how denialism has lost steam in light of newer research and treatments . 	1
Lederer ' s 2006 article is cited on the AIDS Denialism page . 	0

If your answer is no , then please do not hinder me ( or anyone else ) from contributing legitimate facts of truth to balance the obvious bias that is trying to be imposed on a legally elected governing body in order to shift readers to a specific viewpoint . 	0
if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

Since dancehall is a subgenre of reggae , I ' d suggest listing Her as Contemporary R&B ( which includes hip hop / rap ) , Reggae , Pop music ( which includes dance-pop ) , and Rock music . 	1

What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
Now , as for sources . 	0
Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0
We don ' t determine article content by tallying how many times a phrase is or isn ' t mentioned in a handful of online articles ( and that is a handful ; that ' s nowhere near the amount of press coverage the band has had in its career ) . 	0

The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0
Lou Rell has no plans to be a public figure when his wife , Jodi Rell , becomes governor of Connecticut , so it is unclear what his title will be . 	0

As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1

An edit in the introduction stated : ' called in media condemning the Israeli occupation or supporting the Palestinian cause the " Israili Occupation Forces " or by the acrynum " IOF " , or simply " Occupation Army " ' was reverted , the reason given is that sitation needed , this is ridiculous , if you quickly search the term " israeli occupation forces " or " IOF " , a quick view of the result clearly shows that the above statement is a fact , if you wish , there exists a subset of media that mostly condemns the israeli occupation AND / OR supporting the palestinian cause that uses the above mentioned term in order to describe what is officially called in Israel The " Israel Defence Forces " or acronymed " IDF " , this is not about the correctness of the naming , its a FACT ; the term is used , which reflects the definition of these forces by different groups . 	1

Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his " presidential hip " . 	0
It ' s the largest oil spill in U . S . history , that ' s not minor . 	0
Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0

It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1

There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0

In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
