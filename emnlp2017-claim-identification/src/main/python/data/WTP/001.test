The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession , whether it be a doctor , dentist , store worker , gym instructor , etc . . . we shouldn ' t make the article to pander to an American ( especially the sensationalistic media ) viewpoint only , since its supposed to represent the whole world view IMO . 	1
Don ' t get me wrong , I agree that its good we have an actual figure , to disprove anti-catholic propoganda , but I think it could just as easily fit in " Vatican II and beyond " as its not relevent to the world in a full overview , I think thats the point Xander was trying to get across too . 	0

Modern Basque is not " pre-Indo-European " unless it hasn ' t changed since ( Proto - ) Indo-European began being spoken . 	0
The important information conveyed by the sentence in question is that Basque is a language isolate . 	0
Presumably it descends from a non-IE language that was spoken in the Pyrenees region before the arrival of Indo-European speakers , and is in that sense " pre-Indo-European " ; some scholarly references call Basque a " pre-Indo-European " language in this way . 	0
But others simply use " non-Indo-European " , which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn ' t changed since primeval times ; so I ' d prefer to use " non-Indo-European " rather than " pre-Indo-European " . 	0

Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0

I only add that the U .

Why it shouldn ' t be there : as much as the conflict seems significant , it actually does not appear to be that important in an historical perspective , the way we should be looking at the article . 	0

Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : — 	0

From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1

What accounts for that counter-intuitive 20% drop in the HIV - > AIDS progression rate from the subjects infected 10 and 15 years prior ? 	0
This is slightly confusing ( at least to me ) because the abstract also mentions that only 68% of HIV-positive subjects infected 14 years prior progressed to AIDS . 	0
Thus , 92% - - about 9 out of every 10 - - of the HIV-positive subjects progressed to AIDS within 10 years of infection . 	1

With regards to this edit : I planned to simply trim it and then put the bulk of it in the South Park controversies Then I realized it was copied word-for word from the source , and was wondering if a few vague threats from a handful of users on the website mentioned in the source was really notable enough to be deemed a " controversy " yet . 	0

So I think they ' re fair as they are . 	0
And in regard to the two pictures already up in the abortion debate section , although the editor wanted a " better quality " picture for the pro-choice representation , one could also argue that the pro-life representation contains about three people , while the pro-choice one is a sea of people . 	0
Just because Ros has a blatant anti-abortion bias does not mean that his argument has no value . 	0

I noticed this change to the article " In fact recent research has calculated that only one per cent of those convicted by Inquisition tribunals eventually received death penalties " A previous source used said that 3-4% of those convicted in the Spanish Inquision were executed . 	0

Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0
