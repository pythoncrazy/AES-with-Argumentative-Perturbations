Specifically , I was reprimanding Somnobot ' s " quit whining " comment , which was patently uncivil , and Talv ' s " I can tell you have an agenda you ' re attempting to push " comment , which I found mildly , but inappropriately , accusatory in nature ( see WP : AGF ) . 	0

I also came here to insert that info but , after reading the lead , I realized that the lead compares Roman Catholcism with Christianity and the lead of the article on Christianity asserts that Christianity is the largest religion in the world . 	0
I agree that this new information , although interesting , should be left out of the article because comparing Roman Catholicism with Islam is comparing apple and oranges . 	1

Thus , there really is no particularly good place in Wikipedia to compare the number of Roman Catholic adherents against the number of Islamic adherents . 	1

However , prejudicial editing such as this cannot go unchallenged . 	0
In general articles , the information provided is more general and less specific . 	0
In more specific articles , more specific information is appropriate . 	0
Not in this article . 	0
No , not at the level of detail you are proposing . 	0
Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0
i see nothing wrong with including mention of the nations which dispute the " terrorist " label , in fact i think it is required . 	1
you kept reverting that out . 	0
i don ' t think any of this argument is necessary - obviously one man ' s terrorist is another man ' s freedom fighter , as WP : TERRORIST says . 	0
no one here will be convinced to change their mind over a talk page post . 	0
so let ' s just discuss which content belongs and where . 	0
does anyone else have a comment on the compromise i mentioned in the " stop edit warring " section ? 	0
i think okedem has agreed on most of it . 	0
And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we ' re talking about . 	0
And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0
However , once again , the problem with going into this much detail would probably further unbalance the article . 	0

My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie … . . 	0
are you really that naive , or do you have ulterior motives for trying to paint Hamas as a " terrorist organization " ? 	0
I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U . S . / israel / Hamas - They are all democratically elected ( by international standards ) governing bodies and are currently in states of war and are ALL committing legitimate and illegitimate actions , and therefore . 	0
@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0
should be treated equally . 	0
( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U . S . and israeli politicians claiming that the FAR greater civilian deaths caused by their governments are " by accident " . . . . . . because we ' re not supposed to believe Hamas ' claims . . . . . but we ' re supposed to believe U . S . / israeli claims ? ? ? 	0
Could you please explain your reasoning that logically leads you to make this claim ? 	0

And why are we still using the non-Catholic word " pro-life " ( consistent life ethic may work better ) . 	0

I added a line about how this was resolved in a fictitious situation : President Mackenzie Allen ' s husband is titled First Gentleman but her mother eventually joins the white house as a de facto hostess . 	0
But I don ' t see why a First Gentleman couldn ' t perform all the functions of a ' hostess ' , if he was minded to do so . 	0
But here is the second , and very key , point to address - who would be the " hostess of the white house " ? 	0
By definition , the husband cannot be the hostess , so who would be ? 	0
It is all speculation , and it will probably be decided by the mainstream press as much as by the officeholder himself . 	0
" First Gentleman " seems to be the most likely candidate . 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0
Further , if anyone would like to go ahead and address my substantive points above about what I view as this article ' s inherent bias , I think this article would benefit from that as well . 	0
These quesions are as follows : If anyone would like to begin by answering these questions , I think that would make an excellent jumping off point to discuss my inclusion of the NPOV article tagging . 	0
" Mythical " is a compromise , but I think it ' s a fairly accurate one , in that there are without question many myths involving Santa Claus . 	1

Israel did everything possible to avoid civilian casualties , but it can ' t be 100% accurate when fighting against terrorists hiding among the civilian population . 	1
The low number of civilians killed is a testament to Israel ' s morality - in the recent war there were hundreds of aircraft bombings , massive artillery and infantry forces , and yet only several hundreds civilians were killed . 	0
If Israel was trying to kill civilians , each aircraft attack could kill hundreds . 	0
Hamas is actively and openly trying to kill civilians . 	0

As phenomena on Earth clearly do work ( which requires energy ) , a part of the energy is not lost into space but rather does work on Earth . 	0

Isn ' t the material more appropriate for First Vision , though ? 	0
This article is not about the First Vision , it is a broad article about Mormonism in general . 	0
I don ' t see the rationale of including this information in this article . 	0
It also sounds like you are out to " prove " something is the case . 	1
The visits of the angel Moroni to Smith were emphasized by the early church much more than the First Vision , but the details of those visitations are not set out in this article — they are reserved for articles like Angel Moroni . 	0
To me it sounds like you are giving undue weight to the event which actually was not given a great amount of weight at the time . 	0
Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account — other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

Currently no Flag of Ireland exists . 	1

The tricolour certainly should be inserted into the inbox . 	1

Besides , as the user above commented , it is the " de facto " flag of the island . 	0
When one thinks of Ireland , you think of the Tricolour . 	0
Further , the polarization of viewpoint into belief / denial sounds like a religious crusade that ignores nuances ( e . g . , Bob Lederer ' s article , which deserves mention here as well as on the AIDS Denialism page ) . 	0

Of course it is ' problematic ' , but that does not make it less so ? 	0

Popper seems to have espoused the position that falsifiability should be a criterion for considering something scientific , and I think we can all agree that being unfalsifiable is quite problematic , even if sometimes unavoidable . 	0
This is not an exercise in mindreading , but in listing topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience , where the criteria for what constitutes such a characterization is quite loose , as set by the consensus of contributing editors . 	0

In sum , this page is problematic because its carefully constructed scientific information is not carefully complemented with NPOV info on the consequences of HIV . 	1

AND Please note : had either the main IDF page or its Talk page been marked with a " semiprotected " banner , I ' d have been cautioned that new content is being subjected to strict review . . . instead , it just got cut out and now we ' re both spending a lot of time trying to achieve some understanding about why your outline in effect prohibits content that doesn ' t conform due to " undue weight " . 	0
There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) — but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0
I still feel that we ' re not communicating " on the same page " in this exchange ! 	1
I am NOT talking about " bodies criticizing , " but rather IDF combat soldiers relating after the events to their situation in the field vis-a-vis their commanders , comrades at arms , soldiers under their command , and the population in the war zone . 	0

I think what Wassupwestcoast is trying to say is that the scandal here is not really that a few priests did awful things , but that the church as an organization covered it up . 	0
The coverage in this article has focused more on the individual priests , when it really should instead talk about the bishops who moved priests around without informing the new dioceses of past problems . 	0
I haven ' t seen evidence that the level of cover-up that occurred in the RCC has also occurred in Protestant denominations ; if that ' s just my ignorance , then info on Protestant coverups could be offered as a comparison . 	0
It ' s the cover-up , which the RCC as an organization is responsible for , that is the real issue and scandal , not that priests are men , and , like all men , some do evil things . 	0

Pulled from our own Wikipedia page on ' Sect ' Wilson , Bryan Religion in Sociological Perspective 1982 , ISBN 0-19-826664-2 Oxford University Press page 89 " In English , it is a term that designates a religiously separated group , but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation . 	0
A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures . " 	0
I went ahead yesterday after looking at this and added ' see denomination ' right after the word sect . 	0

Lastly , you are vandalizing the article because you are inserting content against consensus ( or at least , without one ) , not to mention the little effort that was apparently put in to proper spelling and capitalization in the edits . 	1
We will need some mainstream sources that use , or discuss the use , of the IOF as an alternative name to IDF , not sources that accuse IDF of occupation , which is a completely different issue . 	0
In general , when trying to insert an alternative term for any article name , this needs to have some official or mainstream credibility , and the guidelines are more stringent than for representing two opposing viewpoints in the article ' s content . 	0
They refer to Israeli forces as occupiers , but do not use the term Israeli Occupation Forces ( notice the capitalization ) as an alternative to Israel Defense Forces ( you are trying to insert a passage into the article which says that the IDF is also called IOF by some , which is not supported by Sean Hoyland ' s articles , and is well-known to represent a fringe point of view — see WP : FRINGE ) . 	0
Do not even use the term . 	0
Do not prove that it ' s a significant viewpoint 2 . 	0
Sean Hoyland provided a number of links , which : 1 . 	0

In any case , I will chime in when I read anything that makes me reconsider ( or reaffirm ) my position . 	0
It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations , something that I think we all agree should be avoided , whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest . 	0
Given the existence of both the history and theology subarticles , there seems ample opportunity to flesh out these connections in places the context makes it clear we are being descriptive . 	0

Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0

The factoid about 500 pages in 60 days can be included in a separate sentence , but this particular sentence is talking about " the faith draw [ ing ] its first converts " . 	0
I agree that the first is wordy and generally a failure at style . 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1
It tells the reader the Why . 	0
The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0
Where relevant , these come later . 	0

While the link between between the Alan Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood is , at best , outdated , or , at worst , mistaken , the following statement of purpose is found on the official Guttmacher Institute site : " The Institute ' s mission is to protect the reproductive choices of all women and men in the United States and throughout the world . 	0
I thus suggest that we create a second disclaimer , such as , " The following statistical resources may be created by those with a non-neutral position in the abortion debate . " 	0
Also , there is reason to move Abortion Statistics and Other Data , given this editorial written by the site ' s owner . 	1
