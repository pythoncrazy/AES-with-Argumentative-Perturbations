My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie … . . 	0
are you really that naive , or do you have ulterior motives for trying to paint Hamas as a " terrorist organization " ? 	0
I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U . S . / israel / Hamas - They are all democratically elected ( by international standards ) governing bodies and are currently in states of war and are ALL committing legitimate and illegitimate actions , and therefore . 	0
@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0
should be treated equally . 	0
( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U .

The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0

I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1

POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0
The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0

What we have to remember is that this is not a list of pseudosciences , but rather a collection of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
Does that make sense ? 	0
I think with proper attribution and context ( historical , academic , etc . ) , we can include items which even in our heart of hearts know are not pseudoscientific and there won ' t be any NPOV problems with this article . 	0
Being included in this list means not that the item is pseudoscientific , but rather that it has the unique distinction of having been called pseudoscientific by some notable source . 	0
Please feel free to pick everything I say apart for analysis and I ' d be happy to go over it with you even further .   : - ) - - 	0
But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands . 	0
Some of us seem to be making a judgment based on our own views of what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience , and we feel that it is wrong to mention psychoanalysis in the same breath as phrenology . 	0

But until we are all open to that , I ' m afraid that this article will have NPOV issues . 	0

The issue of whether or not a comma would be required in this instance is one of grammar and not one of personal whim . 	0
Mk5384 , you have expressed your justification for the comma , and others have explained the context in which a comma would be appropriate and the grammatical reason for why a comma where you have suggested one would require a second comma . 	0
The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1
Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives , as in changing " he is a tall and thin man " to " he is a tall , thin man " . 	0

Similarly , constancy is not a basis upon which to determine punctuation . 	1

So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0

Does that make sense ? 	0

On the other hand , you might be able to say something like : " The earth is a planet containing continents , oceans , and islands , and is the only known source of life in the universe . 	0
It would be unacceptable , for example , to begin the Earth article as follows : " The earth is a " flat , four cornered surface resting on the backs of turtles " which contains continents , oceans , and islands , and is the only known source of natural life in the universe . " 	0
As to citing a gateway site , that ' s problematic . 	1
According to Professor Bob Jones at the Creation Science Institute of Arkansas , the earth is a " flat , four-cornered surface resting on the backs of turtles " . " This , of course , would have WP : UNDUE and WP : FRINGE problems , which is another matter . 	0
Even if a webmaster or editor is reputable , that doesn ' t mean their website has been fact-checked . 	0

A MVA Manual_vacuum_aspiration , with WHO ( anybody know their copyright status ? ) pictures at [ [ 9 ] ] , makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple , and not even that interestingly graphic . 	0
Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
No longer are we just relying on highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science , but rather we are open to including skeptic groups , notable academics and researchers , etc . So now we are not definitively labelling anything pseudoscience . 	0
" The article on amputation shows a hand minus two fingers . 	0

I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

Why don ' t you just let the facts be told , and let people make up their own minds as to what conclusions to make . 	0

if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0

Apples and oranges aside , this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape , and as such , this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view . 	0

Some reliable sources regarding the prevalence of HIV in people who have AIDS in Africa : PMID 19709731 highlights the alarming pattern of rising HIV incidence and prevalence followed by AIDS mortality , and another PMID 19709736 describing the burden of HIV and other communicable and non-communicable diseases there . 	0
Those authors have collected and cited reliable sources . 	0
Could she clarify those ? ; perhaps there is indeed more merit to those suggestions than I can currently see . 	0
I know I don ' t actually edit here much but I have been watching this process closely and regardless of where they came from I actually concur with both suggestions , with the caveat that the proposed reorganization may take some effort to dovetail well . 	0
Re the creed , I have always believed that removing its explicit presentation would be a good thing if space demands suggested it ( as it does here ) . 	0
It seems a simple solution to your concern would be to move or copy the relevant material to the other article ; we are thus guaranteed of having access to the material currently here which is valued by those arguing for keeping it . 	0
Re the moves , I understand that this really is an editorial decision , but one that does have other implications , as you allude to ( although ones I did not understand ; see below ) . 	0
While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown , there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV . 	1
By breaking out those sections as you encourage , it gives the article a slightly more assertive tone merely by this organization , which could be plausibly seen to be subtle POV . 	0
By keeping together content when it is intellectually coherent to do so ( as Karanacs alludes to ) , the tone becomes more descriptive , what IMO such an article should strive to be . 	0

In sum , this page is problematic because its carefully constructed scientific information is not carefully complemented with NPOV info on the consequences of HIV . 	1
I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0

Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1

Despite this , I think that is exactly what is happening right now . 	1
Because most of us here - myself included - would agree that psychoanalysis or Darwinism is not pseudoscientific , we are reluctant to allow their inclusion in this list regardless of whether or not we have notable sources asserting such a characterization . 	0

Well , this could be nearly any notable source which presents such a characterization . 	0
Above , I said , " When we allow some notable gray and not some other notable gray , then this article will suffer of NPOV violations . " 	0
What I meant was that we can ' t pick-and-choose which notable sources we want to use and which ones we don ' t based on the merits of which topics the sources are characterizing as pseudoscience . 	1
The list , the inclusion criteria , and the types of sources allow for grey . 	0

I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt ( which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth ) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit , coney , cunny etc .

I would be willing to consider this , but I suspect such an article may quickly find itself either merged back into this article or deleted . 	0
I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship . 	0
I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1
It ' s a myth that viruses ( and other pathogens ) evolve to low virulence . 	0

However , the Congregation pointed out that " for all " is not a literal translation of the words that Matthew 26 : 28 and Mark 14 : 24 report that Jesus used at the Last Supper and of the words used in the Latin text of the Roman Mass ; " for all " is rather " an explanation of the sort that belongs properly to catechesis .

Pulled from our own Wikipedia page on ' Sect ' Wilson , Bryan Religion in Sociological Perspective 1982 , ISBN 0-19-826664-2 Oxford University Press page 89 " In English , it is a term that designates a religiously separated group , but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation . 	0
A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures . " 	0
I went ahead yesterday after looking at this and added ' see denomination ' right after the word sect . 	0
This preserves the original wording , but gives some neutral insight for a current reader . 	0
They were not only wrong , but corrupt and abominable . 	0
So if the reliable source ( Bryan Wilson ) is correct , then this is a usage completely in line with Smith ' s other words . 	0
Denomination , as far as I know , is not perceived as a negative term really . 	0

As efforts to significantly stanch the leak or entirely prevent the oil from reaching the coast continued , some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident , including a perceived lack of involvement by Obama and the federal government . [ 1 ] Following a month-long series of Congressional hearings , Obama officially began a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to review the matter and recommend steps to avoid similar events in the future . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The bit about Obama visiting the Gulf coast is clunky and out-of-date ( he is there today ) , so that will also need fixing . 	1

I would suggest something more like this : Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident . 	0
Obama visited the Gulf coast on May 2 and again on May 28 , among visits by members of his cabinet . 	0
These are not biographical details about Obama and are best covered in Deepwater Horizon oil spill . 	0
This article should only be concerned with the notable aspects of the event that specifically involve Obama . 	0

Kenosis above writes : First off , this is not properly a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by somebody at some point in time for all of history , but rather is properly presented as a list of topics that are characterized a pseudoscience in light of current , or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method . 	0
I disagree with this statement on the grounds of NPOV . 	0
This is a list of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable person or group at some point in time for all of history . 	1
This is not a list of topics that are characterized as a pseudoscience in light of current , or at least reasonably contemporary scientific method . 	1
If the later was the case , this article would simply be titled " List of pseudosciences " and - per WP : PSCI - we would only be including items which are either obvious pseuodsciences or are generally considered pseudosciences by the general scientific community . 	0
This is a list of topics which have been characterized as pseudosciences . 	0
A characterization is a viewpoint and the inclusion criteria of viewpoints must adhere to NPOV . 	0

I have previously commented in Talk on the irrelevance of social issues such as orphans in the lead of an article about a virus ( which is NOT the same as the syndrome , which is a specific medical term distinct from disease ) . 	0
To me , this suggests that the HIV article needs " more extensive description " , including possible revision of the lead . 	1
The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

Let ' s see what the Vatican has to say : On 17 October 2006 , the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments sent a circular ( No . 467 / 05 / L ) to Presidents of Episcopal Conferences on the question of the translation of " pro multis " . 	0
The Congregation first recalled the 25 January 1974 declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that " there is no doubt whatsoever " regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using " for all " as a translation of " pro multis " , since " for all " corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ ' s intention expressed in the words of the consecration , and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all ( cf . John 11 : 52 , 2   Corinthians 5 : 14-15 , Titus 2 : 11 , 1   John 2 : 2 ) . 	0
