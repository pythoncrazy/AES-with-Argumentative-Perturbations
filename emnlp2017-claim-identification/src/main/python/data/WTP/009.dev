Metal pre-NWOBHM had a sizable blues influence , and even after that . 	0

Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0
Whether his conclusions are correct or not , or shared by anyone else , needs to be contextualised , but claims such as these by Montagnier need to appear in the article . 	1
It can be contextualised , countered by others , etc , but it must be mentioned . 	0
Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1
Whether he ' s going off the deep end or not in our opinion is not important , what ' s important is a good article that fully and accurately covers and the topic . 	0
Montagnier is indisputably a reliable source himself , as one who is " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " . 	0
Some feel that only conclusions accepted in peer reviewed journals deserve a mention , others realise there ' s a much bigger picture . 	0

As for abortion as a surgical procedure , Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
Nonetheless , adding it to those other articles in no way prevents us from placing a more medically accurate image in the induced abortion section of this article . 	0

truth is , that he made the statement and that it can logicly be described as claiming the prevoious claim that the holocaust happened as commonly believed it did , is false . 	0
he did never ever accept the truth about the holocaust but simply said he does not deny it . im sorry but simply stateing " i dont deny " after clearly denying it is not enough . 	1
at least on one occasion , an interview you are familiar with , when confronted with the idea that a genocide of jews happened he circumvated the subject and refrained from calling the holocaust a genocide or even relate to the claim it was a genocide . 	0

Then you haven ' t viewed the latest UN report that asserts that Israeli soldiers deliberately attacked civilian targets in Gaza war . 	0

But again , this is all irrelevant to our dispute here . 	0
The point is here , WP : TERRORIST policy is clear , because usually there is in the story more than " someone is a terrorist " . 	0
And I don ' t see difference between calling someone a terrorist or saying that he uses terrorist tactics . 	0
It is already mentioned in the lead that many countries consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization and no one has objected to that , I don ' t understand why you are pushing now for this statement in the first lines of the article . 	0
If it needs to be defined , then it belongs in Wikitionary . 3 ) Again , I restate the fact that according to the White House , the President is the President . 	0

I ' ve fixed the wording a bit , however the fact that the figure is less than 0 . 02% just shows how irrelevent the sex scandal is in the entire overview of the Catholic Church , thats 99 . 98% who have absoutely nothing to do with sexual abuse scandals . 	1
Not really worthy of inclusion if the number is so low . 	0
Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession , whether it be a doctor , dentist , store worker , gym instructor , etc . . . we shouldn ' t make the article to pander to an American ( especially the sensationalistic media ) viewpoint only , since its supposed to represent the whole world view IMO . 	1
Don ' t get me wrong , I agree that its good we have an actual figure , to disprove anti-catholic propoganda , but I think it could just as easily fit in " Vatican II and beyond " as its not relevent to the world in a full overview , I think thats the point Xander was trying to get across too . 	0

I disagree with both of your perceptions . 	0
I was just thinking that the article is really more POV in the anti-Catholic direction because of the serious lack of commentary on the multitude of charities and good works accomplished around the world . 	1
There are millions of people helped by the church on a daily basis through all their many charities , ministries , hospitals , schools , universities etc . Yet we have a whole paragraph in the Vatican II section on the priest scandals as the only current mention of the church ' s work in the present day world . 	0
If the information was quantified somewhere I would have put the information into the article but it is not quantified on a world basis and we are prevented by Wikipedia policy from creating our own statistics by adding others . 	1
Wassupwestcoast is inordinately interested in putting more than just the facts into the sex scandal paragraph and it is clear from consensus of past discussions that his view is not shared by others on the page . 	1
Karanacs , I have worked to answer your comments yet each time I research to try to put more info showing the " bad " done by the church , I always turn up with information that does not fit your perception . 	0
I have to go with what the sources say and so the information in the article reflects the scholarly works we have cited . 	0
Some useful resources , that include primary references if those are what you seek : a WP page on HIV and AIDS misconceptions that specifically addresses some of the denialist claims you ' re repeating ; the AIDS denialism page shows an electron microscopic image of HIV virions ; the AIDS connection maintained by the National Institutes of Health to address these concerns , which links to a Resources page that has links to more-detailed explanations . 	0
I don ' t have high hopes of convincing you of anything , I just want to keep the page balanced and avoid giving denialism undue weight - HIV clearly causes AIDS . 	1

If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0
In general articles , the information provided is more general and less specific . 	0

In keeping an eye on the grand scale of things , I would like to point out that Popper is one source among very many . 	0
This PDF on the misuse of Popper ' s statements about evolutionary theory is probably also highly relevant but I can ' t read it due to the site demanding a subscription . 	0
Just being notable is not enough , at this level the notability among your notable peers begins to matter , i . e . parity . 	0
The references section in Creation-evolution controversy lists a bunch of people and organizations who are as notable of even more notable than Popper who vouch for the theory of evolution . 	0

My sentence , including the word terrorist would be as follows : " Hamas is a resistance organization that fights against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands . 	0
Well thanks for accepting that part of my position , but ID only answered half of the question asked . 	0
I specifically said " a resistance organization fighting Israeli occupation " . 	0
Would you like to propose a sentence that we can take a look at ? 	0
It has a military wing , the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades , that has carried out terrorist attacks to further that resistance " . 	0
But I doubt that would be accepted . 	0
What ' s so misleading or scary about that ? 	0
The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0
She is a medical physicist . 	0
That said , let me also say that I reviewed various WP guidelines as prodded . 	0
Let me start by saying I made a mistake in regard to " researchers " . 	1
I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1
Secondary sources are actually preferable ( to my surprise ) , mainly because of usability and ease of checking . 	0
POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0
I did watch the National Geographic special , and had exactly that thought . 	0
The researchers ' stronger case is argued from the other direction . 	1
The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1

Although it is argued here that his mother may converted to islam , if that were the case , it can not be seen that Khaddafi has a minimal interest to claim his jewish ancestry . 	0

Any contemporary theocratic muslim government hate jews , but is tolerant to christians just enough to get their support or neutrality . 	0

Trying to paraphrase your argument , you say that reliable sources should be used , but that some editors only want to use reliable sources that are authoritative voices regarding pseudoscientific concepts . 	0
I don ' t think you are making a clear point Levine2112 . 	0
However then you go one to say that these sources are themselves pseudoscientific because they are authorities on pseudoscience . 	0
Such authoritative sources speak for the consensus in the scientific community . 	0
Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves . 	0
That is a very careless argument . 	1
Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science . 	1
Neither are authorities which specialize in discussing pseudoscience provided they stick to scientific consensus . 	0

Purple never were heavy metal album-wise before Sabbath , though , they were hard rock through and through . 	0
Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0
I can ' t help but feel that your justification of AMG is extremely elitist . 	0

The Kings of Dublin expanded their sovereignty to include the Isle of Mann and the Western Isles ( obviously significant in cultural sphere since Gaelic culture continued on in the area ) , as well as southern Northumbria for a while . 	0
2 ) It makes no mention of the fact that the Norse-Gaels founded Ireland ' s largest city Dublin and as Kings of Dublin established themselves as a regional power for a while . 	0
Mention the High King system , I gave Boru as an example because he is the best known ( though I realise he did not actually unify Ireland , rather made an agreement with the O ' Neill ' s . ) 	0
Mention the various Irish kingdoms which existed before and after the Norman conquest - these are obviously still relevent to the present day since the kingdoms of Munster , Ulster , Connacht and Leinster still form a basis of regional identity as so called " provinces " . 	1

On a side note , I see there is a small incomplete chart of Israel military casualties here , I would like to see a full article devoted to Israel ' s casualties like this one : United States casualties of war . 	0
Countries with much more " colorful " military history such as the United States armed forces , French Armed Forces , British Armed Forces , and Indian Armed Forces have no similar controversy section . 	0
For starters , it looks very misplaced . 	0
However I must take issue with the controversy controversy section . 	0
I ' ve been reviewing the article and for the most part it ' s pretty solid . 	0
To be perfectly honest I think those 3 articles could be easily moved into a single article , and any left pertinent information could be moved here . 	0
I propose we move the controversy section to Military history of Israel , History of the Israel Defense Forces , or Israeli wars and armed conflict . 	0

Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0
Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same . 	1

Well , I assure you , many agree with me . 	0
And I don ' t know who you ' ve been talking to , but saying Sabbath isn ' t metal is kind of outrageous , but everyone ' s entitled to their opion , just like Radiohead are to their lousy musical tastes . 	0

It ' s entirely likely the Phoenicians learned from the Sea People - - the Phoenicians learned from everyone . 	0

Culture is of more interest to me than genetics - - though genetics can be of enormous help in tracking the movements of known or likely carriers of culture . 	0
So what ' s of more interest to me is that Phoenician culture is so clearly derived from Canaanite . 	0
Furthermore , some of the groups referred to by a single name in our records were composed of people of very diverse background . 	0
So the relative genetic uniformity of coastal and inland Levantines only requires that any significant input from outside has been pretty much equally distributed between those regions over time . 	0
The Sea People era witnessed significant displacement of people throughout the eastern Mediterranean , and was by no means limited to the coasts . 	0

However , I would like to float a compromise addition to the Denialism section , which carefully contrasts skepticism ( Root-Bernstein ) and denialism ( Duesberg ) , drawing on Lederer ' s nuanced article that explores diverse viewpoints and explains how denialism has lost steam in light of newer research and treatments . 	1
Lederer ' s 2006 article is cited on the AIDS Denialism page . 	0
When I say " float " , I mean a heart-felt request that all editors who are so dedicated to keeping this page clear will allow 24 hours for everyone to view my changes before reverting . 	0

There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) — but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0
I still feel that we ' re not communicating " on the same page " in this exchange ! 	1
I am NOT talking about " bodies criticizing , " but rather IDF combat soldiers relating after the events to their situation in the field vis-a-vis their commanders , comrades at arms , soldiers under their command , and the population in the war zone . 	0
Would a mention of the issue with an internal link such as this be acceptable ? 	0

I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0

Do you at least agree that it is inappropriate to remove the { { bias } } tag without proper consenus ? 	0

Our current inclusion criteria would definitely allow sourced mention , especially since it is not us who are characterizing , but the sources . 	1

I looked them up when you mentioned them first , and they were what I expected ; very similar to Zeppelin , very blues-influenced , and not heavy metal at all , but understandably influential , even if Sabbath never heard them . 	0

Lastly , you are vandalizing the article because you are inserting content against consensus ( or at least , without one ) , not to mention the little effort that was apparently put in to proper spelling and capitalization in the edits . 	1
We will need some mainstream sources that use , or discuss the use , of the IOF as an alternative name to IDF , not sources that accuse IDF of occupation , which is a completely different issue . 	0
In general , when trying to insert an alternative term for any article name , this needs to have some official or mainstream credibility , and the guidelines are more stringent than for representing two opposing viewpoints in the article ' s content . 	0
They refer to Israeli forces as occupiers , but do not use the term Israeli Occupation Forces ( notice the capitalization ) as an alternative to Israel Defense Forces ( you are trying to insert a passage into the article which says that the IDF is also called IOF by some , which is not supported by Sean Hoyland ' s articles , and is well-known to represent a fringe point of view — see WP : FRINGE ) . 	0

I refer you to the section on Palestinian ancestry here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian#The_ancestry_of_the_Palestinians Read there to see that the predominant view of most historians is that populations in the Levant adopted the Arabic language and most of them were not descended from Arabs . 	1

In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
