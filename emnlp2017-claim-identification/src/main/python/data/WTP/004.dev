The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1

While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0
Am I an editor refusing to allow " any mention " of it in the article ? 	1
No . 	1
Wassap , I don ' t see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short . 	1

Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0

My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0
Is the section really a problem as is ? 	0
Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0

I just noticed the article has a tag reading " Note : Do not add " hard rock " here . 	0
I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0
There are even exceptions to this ( particularly ZZ Top , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Foghat , and Meat Loaf ) . 	0

If someone types in " America " what country do you think they are looking for ? 	0
The USA probably . 	0
But there are other countries in the Americas , thus it points to a page structured similar to the " Catholic Church ( disambiguation ) " page showing everything someone might be looking for . 	0
I can find you dozens of precedents like this on Wikipedia . 	0
For some reason , though , some people on here feel sooo strongly that " Catholic Church " should point to " Roman Catholic Church . " 	0

And I ' m still not seeing any actual evidence which suggests that GNU was axiomatically important for kernel development in a way which necessitates bringing this up so strongly in the intro . 	0
This can certainly be argued for things like gcc , but not the userspace . 	0
And further , this doesn ' t defend the old wording , which gave a whole paragraph of the intro over to the development of GNU rather than the Linux kernel . 	0

Levine2112 can choose to remain in the rabbit hole and view things Through the Looking-Glass , but we don ' t have to stay with him or encourage him by replying to his comments . 	0
Since the dispute over the LEAD and inclusion criteria is now a moot point ( yes , it has been discussed to death and Levine2112 ' s comments aren ' t making sense ) , only maintained by Levine2112 ' s wikilawyering , moving on to the tag is the logical next step . 	1
Agreed . 	0
Popular discourse elevates Sabbath ' s importance to the detriment of their contemporaries , when even a basic review of the most important and in-depth sources on metal establish that Sabbath wasn ' t the sole progenitor of metal , and they weren ' t as unique as some believe them to be . 	0
Sabbath is great , sure , but they didn ' t single handedly invent metal , a fallacy which has been floating around for about the last decade . 	1

Private property is increasingly under attack in South Africa due to squatters that take over entire buildings , farms , etc . . . 	0

Also , as for the ANC being a freely and fairly elected party do you have any idea what ' necklacing ' is and what it entails ? 	0
F . W . said that he didn ' t want to raise the issue of voter fraud due to his concerns that it might spark a civil war . 	0
Furthermore they actually have their own variety of Zimbabwe style " land reform " which they call " willing seller , willing buyer " along the lines of what Namibia does . 	0
They have elections but nothing ever changes and the ruling party always manages to receive a conveniently large majority of the votes . 	0
Nominally South Africa is a capitalist democracy , in actuality it is more in line with communist tyranny . 	0
Courts are very reluctant to evict these people since they seem to believe that the so-called " landless people " have a right to acquire the property of others . 	0
You certainly cannot sell your farm to foreigners . 	0
You are not free to sell your farm to anybody who wants to buy it , you must first let the government make an offer , which is a below market offer , and if you refuse you are not allowed to sell it . 	0

The 48-hour hiatus was a technical step which ( so far as I am aware ) had no practical consequence . 	0
The anon IP does have a point in this edit . 	0
However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

I ' m not sure of your claim that pharmaceutical abortions are more prevalent than surgical ones . 	0
However , I agree with you about those who seek to portray all abortions in the same way ( although it is * quite * possible to find quite graphic photos for most surgical procedures and the saline abortion method ) . 	0
I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points , not to create an encyclopedia . 	0
( I dispute that this is a " functional " tactic , as you put it ; for various reasons , it almost invariably backfires on the anti-abortionist who presents the image . 	0
Wikipedia cannot compensate for the inequities of justice systems the world over . 	0

It can ' t hold a candle to " Black Sabbath " or anything from " Master Of Reality " . 	0

I don ' t know why you persist , if you can ' t see how they discarded blues . . . well , please do listen to the albums I mentioned , among them " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " , and tell me that you notive the slightest blues in it . 	0

Darwinism is a catch-all term that means different things to different people at different times , Popper didn ' t call it " pseudoscience " , he stated that it was " not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research program . " 	1

Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0
Anything that can be depicted visually is better written in descriptive text . 	0
Shock images , whether " pro-life " or " pro-choice , " serve little to no informative purpose . 	0
On the contrary , Ros , the only reason for adding such images would be ideological bias . 	1

I meant no offense however , and was merely saying that there are quite a few indicators in that picture as to what the nature of the picture is , and these identifiers wouldn ' t be understandable to most people in the world , just like I wouldn ' t understand many things obvious to a New Yorker for example . 	0

In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
And to what end ? 	0
It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0
