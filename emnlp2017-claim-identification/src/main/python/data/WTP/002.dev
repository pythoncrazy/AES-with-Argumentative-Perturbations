All this talk about Grand Lodge of BC & Yukon is irrelevant . 	0
The actual article was originally written by a member of Ars Quattuor Coronati , which is a Masonic Research Lodge which meets in England under the auspices of the United Grand Lodge of England ! 	0
The statement - " the regularity of his initiations had been disputed " - is a pure fact , and get this : Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book " Confessions . " 	0
( NB : It ' s not actually a recognised body of UGLE - it ' s a Grand Lodge in its own right , i . e . an independent body with which UGLE is in amity ) . 	0
Hence for these reasons , I propose that the original wording should actually stand . 	1
Note that in the sentence under discussion no attempt is made to discuss the thorny issue of whether an Irregular Masonic body is real Masonic body , or just something that purports to be Masonic . 	0

Removing the entire section wasn ' t a positive move toward change . 	0

Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0

Indeed there was a broad consensus , but to be more precise , it was to make the title NPOV and to bring it into harmony with the existing inclusion criteria and existing contents . 	0

I am very afraid that if it is not included in the lead , if this article ever reaches the main page there will be scads of people trying to put that into the lead for you . 	0
It would be much better to find a good , NPOV to portray the controversies ( such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above ) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense . 	1
The child abuse scandals , or the RCC ' s positions on homosexuality , abortions , and euthanasia , are controversies that are well known outside of the RCC . 	0
The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue , although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out . 	0
Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy . 	0
By all means mention it in the lead if you choose , but I believe the more recent controversies need a single line in the lead as well . 	1

Neither of those terms make clear , as the Easter Bunny article does , that Santa is a myth . 	0
A real person can be " historical . " 	0
A real person can be " legendary " . 	0
" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
I am guessing no one is up for that . 	0
Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0

We just want to know if by stating that foo is unfalsifiable , was Popper - in his own mind - characterizing foo as a pseudoscience . 	0

Does anyone here disagree with that ? 	0

San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks , with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there , so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead . 	0

Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0

The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0

A factual claim , right or wrong , is not criticism . 	0
And what you ' re referring to is criticism in the sense of critique , something we don ' t really do for articles about people , but we do in say films , where many have a " critical reception " section . 	0
That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0
Anyway , it ' s very unlikely that the editors would agree now to adding a criticism section , and I ' m not sure how productive a protracted discussion would be here . 	0
Aha - You ' ve let your raison d ' etre slip - a line intentionally inserted to place the blame firmly on unionists for causing the split . 	0

If you were to take a neutral party and have them read both the Obama and Bush articles , they would come to one of two conclusions . 	0
I agree with OP . 	1
The newly rewritten intro - This is a list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skepticalorganizations , or by notable academics or researchers . . . - makes no mention of the organizations or people being only those with " mainstream " points of view . 	0
I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

Traditional heavy metal primarily draws from two sources ( one a foreign language source ) , so it ' s in no way indicative of all research available on metal . 	0
Also , I ' ve long advocated that that page be redirected here ( you don ' t have a " traditional punk rock " article , for comparison ' s sake ) , but the editors who work on that page have been staunchy against that in the past , even though it ' s more or less redundant to this article . 	0
This then raises the question of NPOV , which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals . 	0
Now , if the argument is that the article can ' t be FA unless the lead includes the sex abuse scandals , and we want FA rather than follow WP guidelines , well that ' s ok with me . 	0
The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church . 	0

Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1
Our current inclusion criteria would definitely allow sourced mention , especially since it is not us who are characterizing , but the sources . 	1

If it is a significant viewpoint , we must include it . 	1
But why is it being added to this article ? 	0
We ' re setting out a brief introduction to Mormonism in general , including its origin , beliefs and practices , cultural impact , etc . A mention of the First Vision is enough . 	0
I have again removed details related to the First Vision of Joseph Smith that I just don ' t think belong in this article about Mormonism . 	0
I think this is detail that could be relevant and be included in a more specific article , such as First Vision . 	1
This material has been repeatedly re-added to this article . 	0
I don ' t get it . 	0

Thanks for removing it . 	0

Highly-publicised cases of sexual abuse by clergy in the United States and Ireland led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse . 	0

The " Modern challenges faced by the church " phrasing is good . 	0
I ' m not so keen on : Suggested re-wording : Modern challenges faced by the church include the rise of secularism , and controversy over its prohibition of abortion , contraception and euthanasia . 	0
Personally , as much as I find fault with the translation , I think that if that is in fact the legitimate " Official Website of the President of Iran " , then I would like us to add a cited quotation from it . 	0
The only issue that gives me pause is the fact that I don ' t know how to verify whether it really is the official website . - - 	0
I think you have communicated your perspectives clearly . 	0
So , instead of risking repeating yourselves or derailing into a private squabble , how about if we open it up to other editors , so we can make sure we have a consensus ? 	0
Well , I think you two have been doing a great job . 	0
Seriously . 	0
However , concerning your question wether the two terms are different , that is another discussion we can carry on at the appropriate wiki talk pages . 	0
Well , I found the connection between lonelygirl15 and Crowley : http://www.lg15.com/lgpedia/index.php?title=Aleister_Crowley IMO what was reported in Wikipedia was exxaggerated . 	0
So I changed my mind , it can be not restored . - - 	0

some searching revealed it to be the work of noted AFP photographer Menachem Kahana . 	0
While the image doubtless has worth conveying the values of the IDF , such blatant disrespect for one of Israel ' s greatest photographers can hardly be ignored . 	1
Joe407 , consensus or no consensus - the gallery can ' t use images by famous israeli photographers without giving them due credit . 	0
I saw today an image of female soldiers saluting at a memorial service which looked too " good " to be the work of an amateur photographer and indeed . . 	0
Given the 2 , 000 year history of the church , the sex abuse scandals hardly register when compared with the persecution by Roman emperors , Arian heresy , schism of 1054 , Reformation , and French revolution . 	0
So if you ' re not being ' recentist ' ( yech , neologism ) , how do you justify putting this in the lead and not the other really big controversies that I mentioned earlier ? 	0
What is most recent is not necessarily what is most notable : new information should be carefully balanced against old , with due weight accorded to each . " 	0
A light mentioning of the LGBT is good enough . 	1
This article is for SF , not directly about LGBT . 	0
Though I do think that SF is a haven for the gay population . 	0
I changed it so the most far reaching sentance is at the end , as should be done . 	0
A reliable published secondary source resolves the problem , which I shall add that to the article shortly . 	0
This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0
Anything is better than a whitewash . 	0
Still , I am reasonable enough to agree to keep it out if you present some other argument ( other than censorship ) 	0
I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1
Or how he said it Kermit Just looks kool I thought Brian Henson voiced Kermit now . 	0
The Jim Henson page lists someone else . 	0
-prnyouth I like Kermit the frog pictures . 	0
I don ' t have clue what he said . 	0
Can anyone give a cite for Kermit speaking at Henson ' s funeral ( outside of a video retrospective or something of the sort ) ? 	0
I think whoever added that info is confusing Edgar Bergen ' s funeral with Henson ' s - - since Henson and Kermit did speak at that funeral . 	1
I don ' t think Kermit spoke at Henson ' s funeral . 	1
Steve Whitmire was not officially named as Henson ' s successor for Kermit until MUCH later , and his first appearance performing Kermit was in the special the Muppet did remembering Jim Henson . 	0
Scray ' s remarks are instructive . 	0

The current format should remain for the sake of consistency . 	0
I have previously proposed that a brief description of this latest " Berlin patient " remain in HIV while the rest be moved to Gero Huetter , where the news content , etc . , would be more appropriate , and in light of Scray ' s reminders , I think it ' s time to do that . 	1

The uncertainty about this anecdote , the tendency towards speculation to fill in the gaps , and the relative unreliability of anecdotes for important medical articles suggests that the extent of the section here is a violation of weight . 	0
While there are many proposed new treatments for HIV / AIDS , we should use reliable sources to describe them if they are sufficiently notable to be included at all . 	0
Otherwise almost everything is a borderline case , and the discussions will never stop . 	0
We need better sourcing . 	0
If we , not being a primary source , have no information on whether this is verifiable , nor any information on a pending court date , then we have no business reporting it per WP : CRYSTAL BALL . 	0
I went through and removed ones that seemed obviously unnecessary , and left a few in without checking them thoroughly . 	0
Feel free to remove existing links , too . 	0
I agree with user Levine2112 who states that it looks like a POV-fork if we restrict the inclusion criteria . 	0
A major organization ( even if it is a " science fiction religion " ) has characterized the topic as pseudoscience . 	0
Can ' t we just state WHO characterized it as pseudoscience ? 	0

What is " obscene " is - first - suggesting that South Africa is comparable to Zimbabwe in that respect - and second - assuming that because the Communist Party is a member of the ruling alliance , that it must be a communist state . 	0
' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1
Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

I belongs in the article , but not in the lead because it is a leading characteristic of the Catholic church . 	0
As Xandar has stated that were are a million priests ( if not more ) and surely if one looked hard enough you would find a plethora of sin amongst them . 	1
Sexual abuse , regardless of where it is found , is a travesty and serious . 	0
As a non-Catholic I do not have a horse in this race , but as a fellow editor I would recommend not putting it in the lead . 	1
However , this does not mean that the Catholic church has a problem ; rather it means that the religious are human and are no different than the rest of humanity , they have just chosen to devote their lives to God in spite of their weaknesses . 	1
Where should information such as this be included in the article ? 	0
Take a look and tell us what you think . 	0
I think this is notable mention , particularly this excerpt Nobel Laureate Montagnier : HIV Can Be Cleared Naturally - House of Numbers . 	0
The attendant Music Of The Sun featured a heady mix of dancehall , reggae and R&B tracks . 	0

In addition , the article also uses music encyclopedias , not just web resources . 	0
All of this has been discussed before , and is already sourced in the ' Musical Style ' section of the infobox . 	0

But the sun does not absorb energy ; it rather releases vasts amount of it . 	0
The sun is indeed a source of negative entropy . 	0
The sentance that was deleted was entirly vaid so I put it back it . - - 	0
Where is the energy that the sun is absorbing coming from ? 	0
The sentance implies that the net energy output of the sun is zero ( " the amount of energy absorbed by the sun is equal to the amount released " ) which is of course a ridiculous statement . 	0
Maybe I could do my own statistics . " 	0

Nope , common descent does not produce biodiversity . 	1

They practically single-handedly created this genre , light-years away from Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple , playing slow and detuned , discarding the blues-influence before Judas Priest ( Master of Reality , Sabbath Bloody Sabbath , Vol 4 ) . 	0
They should get their own paragraph in the very beginning . 	1
This article will never be good or accurate as long as it has one fundamental error : Black Sabbath . 	0

I dont think you can call a group a terrorist organization in WP ' s narrative voice . 	0
I would not be opposed to saying they have a militant wing that has carried out terrorist attacks , but I would be opposed to calling that wing " terrorist " . 	0
But here is one source that calls it an " Islamic militant resistance organization " . 	0
Here is another one that says " Hamas is first and foremost a resistance organization " . 	0
I have a problem calling the organization terrorist , I dont have a problem saying that they have committed terrorist attacks . 	1
Terrorism is a tactic that can describe individual attacks without issue . 	0
( ec ) There are also sources that call it a resistance organization that fights Israeli occupation . 	0
If you ' re suggesting that this makes the Taylor ' 86 and / or Rutherford ' 90 more reliable than Buchbinder ' 94 , I would disagree . 	1
Neuromancer , I ' m not sure why you mention the fact that Abbott " does not cite any newer information . " 	0
If anything , I would say that Buchbinder is more reliable ( given that Buchbinder ' 94 has been cited 15% more and has had four fewer years to accumulate citations compared Rutherford ' 90 ) . 	0
The Taylor , Rutherford , and Buchbinder papers are noted as having respectively 49 , 237 , and 273 citations per Google Scholar . 	0
Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
I agree . 	0
Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
