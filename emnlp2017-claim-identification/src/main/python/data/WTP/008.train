Nu metal is just an umbrella term used to describe all metal bands that add elements of alternative or rap music to their music . 	0

I view Smith ' s 1838 personal history as a good source for explaining what he said happened to him . ) 	0

So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0

If there was a universal common ancestor , then evolution would produce all current biodiversity we see today from this organisms . 	0
Again , notice that argueing for biodiversity we use evolutionary forces . 	0
Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

The very essence of what is involved in the proper understanding of pseudoscience and skepticism are being violated here . 	0
When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0
If they have any legitimate criticisms , then it should be possible to find them in mainstream sources , not fringe sources . 	0

Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0

It can be contextualised , countered by others , etc , but it must be mentioned . 	0
Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1
Whether he ' s going off the deep end or not in our opinion is not important , what ' s important is a good article that fully and accurately covers and the topic . 	0
Montagnier is indisputably a reliable source himself , as one who is " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " . 	0

An anecdote , however exciting , is not a reliable source for a medical article , and even if the overwhelming surge of media coverage compels us to include it for now , it should not command its own section of the article . 	0
In any case , what a handful of rock journalists have said is beside the point , considering that progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music , and they have none of the musical elements associated with the term " nu metal " . 	1
The guitarist even points out that he doesn ' t use the tuning style frequently associated with that term . 	0

However , while the worst MSNBC have done is lean to the left , FOX has a history of failing to do basic fact checking : before Sanford , they called Specter , Foley , and even McCain Democrats on one occasion or another . 	0

All this talk about Grand Lodge of BC & Yukon is irrelevant . 	0
The actual article was originally written by a member of Ars Quattuor Coronati , which is a Masonic Research Lodge which meets in England under the auspices of the United Grand Lodge of England ! 	0
The statement - " the regularity of his initiations had been disputed " - is a pure fact , and get this : Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book " Confessions . " 	0
( NB : It ' s not actually a recognised body of UGLE - it ' s a Grand Lodge in its own right , i . e . an independent body with which UGLE is in amity ) . 	0

Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession , whether it be a doctor , dentist , store worker , gym instructor , etc . . . we shouldn ' t make the article to pander to an American ( especially the sensationalistic media ) viewpoint only , since its supposed to represent the whole world view IMO . 	1
Don ' t get me wrong , I agree that its good we have an actual figure , to disprove anti-catholic propoganda , but I think it could just as easily fit in " Vatican II and beyond " as its not relevent to the world in a full overview , I think thats the point Xander was trying to get across too . 	0

Modern Basque is not " pre-Indo-European " unless it hasn ' t changed since ( Proto - ) Indo-European began being spoken . 	0
The important information conveyed by the sentence in question is that Basque is a language isolate . 	0
Presumably it descends from a non-IE language that was spoken in the Pyrenees region before the arrival of Indo-European speakers , and is in that sense " pre-Indo-European " ; some scholarly references call Basque a " pre-Indo-European " language in this way . 	0
But others simply use " non-Indo-European " , which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn ' t changed since primeval times ; so I ' d prefer to use " non-Indo-European " rather than " pre-Indo-European " . 	0

If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
I think there might be confusion here . 	0
@Eldereft . 	0
Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

These too are important points , but as you have seen in this article , it is more important to point out more obscure and poorly understood doctrines like polygamy and blacks & the priesthood . 	0
The US supreme court decision of 1890 upholding the Idaho law disenfranchising Polygamy , and the almost simultaneous Feb 1890 Official Manifesto by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints officially banning plural marriage is not relevant . 	0

The question , as stated above , is not whether it ' s relevant to the IDF , but whether it is undue weight and recentism . 	0
The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church â€¦ " 	1
Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0

Well to me , as an old fart , this multiplicity of sub-sub-sub-genres is both divisive and unnecessary , since these terms seem to be created either by rock journalists , whom Frank Zappa once described as " people , who can ' t write , interviewing people , who can ' t talk , for people , who can ' t read . " , or by the fans themselves in order to distinguish themselves from some other sub-sect . 	1
If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0

Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0
Also , the current pair of pictures create a thematic juxtaposition , centred about two Washington landmarks . 	0
For reference , my input is that she be listed R&B , reggae , pop , rock . 	0
After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0

Very few references can be found to support that Rihanna is a reggae singer , all I managed to find was her allmusic page which lists reggae after pop , and lists both as styles under the main genre R&B . 	1
This is a new discussion , to gain new consensus . 	0

If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0

The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0

The issue that brought this up had to do with some disagreement over whether to include two theories , specifically meteorites and continental drift , that have long been considered scientific ( or " real " phenomena if you prefer ) by the scientific community . 	0

I ' m simply saying that newspapers with varying political biases , and different levels of trustworthiness , can all be used if one is careful to evaluate each specific statement for whether it is supported by the source and whether the specific piece cited is reliable for supporting that particular statement . 	1

It does not seem logical to deem Hamas " terrorist " and not israel at the same time . 	1
I believe Hamas actions have NEVER been more " terroristic " than ANY other group involved in the war . . . . . israeli or Palestinian groups â€¦ â€¦ and therefore , I am simply advocating for FAIR AND BALANCED behavior and descriptions of ALL parties involved . 	0
If you wish to see proof of the extent of all parties " terrorism " actions / consequences , check the statistics section on this website . . . http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp â€¦ . 	0
Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0
To claim that Hamas is the cause of MORE " terrorism " activities / targeting is simply against the facts and numbers . 	0

" Pro-life " actually does apply directly to contraception , from a Catholic understanding , because of both " emergency contraception " ( which many argue is abortion ) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life . 	1

I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0

The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0

And why are we still using the non-Catholic word " pro-life " ( consistent life ethic may work better ) . 	0

The scandals could have far-reaching consequences for the Roman Catholic church in a country which the Vatican has long regarded as a source of moral renewal for the world . 	0
The section details conflicting opinions about what the most accurate and " honest " translation is . 	0
This discussion produced a secondary controversy over what is the " correct " translation of the quote . 	0
Out of curiosity , are you at any stage going to find the sources that back up the assertion " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " or can we disregard that as bluster ? 	0
The official translation provided by the Iranian government is therefore immediately notable . 	0
To apply this definition of disorder to the world around us will be like measuring the " power of an argument " in Watts . 	0

We now need to discuss how to change the answer to question 1 to make sure it is noted that Obama was factually wrong when he stated in his book that he went to a " Muslim school " . - - 	0
The account by people who the Israeli media seem to accept as being close cousins , is that the maternal grandmother was a Jew who was married at first to a Jewish man who mistreated her . 	0
I am reading " psychoanalysis may contain information to the effect that it has been alleged to be pseudoscience " , which is also in the text you cited . 	0
Her daughter became Gaddafi ' s mother . 	0
She ran away with a Muslim sheikh , converted to Islam . 	0
In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1
If born to a Jewish mother , you qualify as a Jew and at least some authorities maintain it does not matter if your mother--born Jewish--aposticizes and joins another religion . 	0

This article looks to me , a layman who has indirectly encountered research as a freelance editor , like a very detailed biological article that explains everything one would want to know about a virus . 	1

When does the nationality of a performer ever create a genre ? 	0
Here ' s a practical example ; The sub-genre of Thrash Metal breaks out mid-80s , a mostly American phenomenon . 	0
Yes there are others and I ' m aware of them but can you sit here and enumerate tons of bands described as Funk Metal ? 	0
Even then , most of these bands fit into the Alternative Metal category as well , maybe even more so . EDIT : Also , there ' s an argument about breaking racial boundaires ? 	0
Shortly after , a similar style emerges in Germany with common traits that differentiate it from its American counterparts . 	0

It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0
The " Old Catholic Church " is known as just that - although it is not very old . 	0
While " Roman Catholic Church " may be acceptable for an article title to avoid confusion . 	0

Purple never were heavy metal album-wise before Sabbath , though , they were hard rock through and through . 	0
Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0

Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0

I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ã“ Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
It was . 	0
I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0
I recall the last time we had a debate about abortion , we passed a bill out of here . 	0
Now , as I said before , this probably won ' t make any difference . 	0
Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0
Contentious misunderstandings â€” say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings â€” is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0

Everything else can be part of History of the Israel Defense Forces , which for some reason no one wants to work on . 	0
Therefore I believe there should be a controversy section but it should be small and deal with controversies that have historical significance . 	0
Moreover , Wikifan is quite right about not having such sections for other armies . 	0
I bet some Wikipedians would like that , but this would not lead to a balanced article . 	0
If you can find such sources , it would be interesting to have a look , but if we including the Liberty incident , we might as well have a 100-page controversy section detailing every screw-up the IDF has ever made . 	0
I ' ve read a few books on general IDF history ( as opposed to specific episodes ) , and none of them talk in-depth about the USS Liberty incident or attribute it significance in the long term . 	0
However , from an historical point of view , it ' s a fairly small incident that had almost no influence on anything . 	1
The USS Liberty incident is well-known because it was one of the greatest friendly fire debacles in Israeli history and also as one of the main US-related incidents in IDF history . 	0
As Shuki correctly noted , we have to put the events in perspective . 	0
We just want to know if by stating that foo is unfalsifiable , was Popper - in his own mind - characterizing foo as a pseudoscience . 	0
I think the point here is not whether " unfalsifiability equals science " is a true statement in general , but rather if Popper felt it to be true a true statement . 	0
Does anyone here disagree with that ? 	0
Now that ' s basically my position at the present time , keeping in mind that personal opinions are not what determines content here , but on talk pages we do benefit from exploring the issues involved and explaining why we do or do not support the inclusion or formatting of certain matters . 	0
In The Logic of Scientific Discovery , Popper suggested the criterion of falsifiability to distinguish science from non-science . 	0

per wp : terrorist , the note on this very talkpage says that words like terrorist and freedom fighter are " inherently non-neutral , so they should not be used as unqualified labels in the voice of the article . 	0

It probably deserves its own article ( very interesting case of apparent archaeological forgery ) ; in this article it deserves nothing but a very short sentence along the lines of : In 2006 , a set of early Basque inscriptions were reported at Veleia , seeming to push the earliest dated writing in Basque to the third Century , but the were soon discovered to be forgeries . 	1

You argue that two Boston based groups , one of which claims to be Catholic are proof that even more of the world wide Catholic Church article needs to be centered on the US sex abuse scandal . 	0
There are hundreds of disaffected catholic and crypto-catholic groups with websites , ranging from pro-abortionists to groups that think the Pope is Protestant ! 	0
I think we merely need to find specific objective criteria that we can agree on . 	0

Are you equally astute in following up cild abuse issues in the Anglican Church articles , or those about the Baptist Church , or UK Social Services ? 	0
Trawling up odd snippets about the Bishop of Yakima hiring a man " under investigation " for viewing pornography as a student ( and who was then dismissed from the seminary ) does not make it a world-shattering event - or show that the Catholic Church is uniquely evil - as seems to be an underlying theme here . 	0
I think the POV of the article is quite appropriate to the issue 	0

The scandal is already featured beyond its weight in this article . 	0

Starting this discussion because a user was not happy with the genres being listed as " R&B , pop , reggae " instead of " R&B , reggae , pop " and an edit war over such an arrangement would be silly . 	0
R&B and pop have been the artist ' s main genres since her second album and influences were also present on her first . 	0
Reggae was prevalent on the artist ' s first album and partially on her second ; from 2008 to present , only influences have been present . 	0
How do other editors feel about this proposal ? 	0
The artist is more known for her contributions to those two genres than to reggae , which is why they should be listed first . 	0

Okay , I ' ve made some minor cleanups and corrections . 	0
Please note that the article does not in any way assign blame to BP , something that is beyond the scope here . 	0
Instead it correctly notes that BP is the well operator , lead the cleanup / containment effort so far , and bore the brunt of the public cry for Obama to do something . 	0
Those are the most salient facts of BP ' s involvement as it concerns Obama . 	0

( It was that against which Gavia immer was voting , not the underlying rules of grammar . ) 	0
The issue of whether or not a comma would be required in this instance is one of grammar and not one of personal whim . 	0
Mk5384 , you have expressed your justification for the comma , and others have explained the context in which a comma would be appropriate and the grammatical reason for why a comma where you have suggested one would require a second comma . 	0
The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1
Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives , as in changing " he is a tall and thin man " to " he is a tall , thin man " . 	0
( Such is apparent from the comment about the Bush article . ) 	0
Similarly , constancy is not a basis upon which to determine punctuation . 	1

Undue weight doesn ' t factor in as far as BP is concerned because we ' re covering how these events relate to Obama , not to BP . 	1
If readers want to get a more complete picture of what is behind this , that ' s what wikilinks are for . 	0
This wasn ' t a fine point , the prose looked awful and apologetic , full of things that have very little to do , and only indirectly , with the life and times of Barack Obama . 	0
What would be undue would be lots of exculpatory material to try to show that what " actually happened " isn ' t as damning as the public perception . 	1
We ought to use the correct rather than colloquial name . 	0
Okay , we can clean up a few things . 	0
One way or another we need to keep this section manageable , and the most obvious solution is to chop off stuff of tangential relevance . 	0
The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event , but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened , when , whose fault it was , and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama , not BP and its tribulations . 	0
No , if you look towards the bottom of the page ( in the succession navigation box ) , where predecessors and successors for any awards , offices , etc one has held or received , you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his " predecessor " and Alexi Gianoulias as his " successor " . 	1

As far as wikipedia policy goes , you won ' t find anything to support renaming the article Israel occupation force . 	0
For those who are unaware , the vast majority of the Israeli army are stationed in Israeli-proper , not the West Bank or the Golan . 	0
So was the IDF known as the " IOF " because the " occupation " began between 1948-1967 ? 	0
The " IOF " , IMO ( obviously ) is simply another buzzword designed to villify and demonize the Israeli army . 	0
So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
Now where does the " grey " come in ? 	0
Does that make sense ? 	0
If you want add links for other large scale operations , then that would also be relevant for the lead ( and improve the article without using up any more than a few additional words ) . 	0
The addition consists of only three words and it makes the article more comprehensive and relevant . 	0
The number of casualties is one of the best measures for judging the scale of a war ( since statistics like this are more objective and verifiable than questions of " historical significance " ect ) . 	1
The fact that , as you say , it ' s been re-added about 50 times , shows that the wikipedia consensus is that it stay . 	0
As to whether or not it should count as a war , then that is surely just a matter of semantics - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarFinally I agree this info should also be added to the main history article as well . 	0

To truly be labelled a pseudoscience , as per WP : PSCI , the topic must be an Obvious pseudoscience or Generally considered pseudoscience . 	0
While some of the entries on this list are definitive pseudosciences , some of the entries are not . 	0
The problem as I see it stems from that this article is NOT a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	1
I am going to tag this entire article with POV issues tag . 	0
Currently , this article violates this fundemental principle of Wikipedia because it is purposefully excluding certain significant views on what characterizes a pseudoscience . 	1
I don ' t really love that we are sidestepping aroung a piece of WP : NPOV , but that is what we are working with at the moment . 	0
However , this list does not attempt to truly label any topic as a pseudoscience , but rather present some notable group ' s or person ' s characterization and therefore sidesteps around WP : PSCI . 	0
( Note that the word " skeptical " links not to skepticism but rather to scientific skepticism . ) 	0
The recently changed inclusion criteria in the lead limits the viewpoints to just those of " organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skeptical organizations , or by notable academics or researchers " , thus excluding a great deal of significant views that are not necessarily part of this limiting criteria . 	0
What ' s the problem now ? 	0
However , his assertion that this would make it difficult for you two to talk to each other remains to be proven . 	0

The reference directly addresses the charge by Israel that Hamas deliberately puts its militia in close proximity to civilians . 	0

Obviously , Obama has received criticism for a number of his policies and activities in the last year , especially his push for health care legislation , his continuation of Bush ' s foreign policy , evinced by his decision to send additional troops into the field , and his unwillingness to close Gitmo , another Bush policy he ' s left unchanged . 	0

Now , logical assessment will lead you to conclude that this is just semantics and that countries committing the same acts as " terrorists " would also fall into the category of " terrorism " . . . . . . . . it ' s just that the U .

There is a lot more to the subject than that , and images don ' t have to be of dead bodies themselves . 	1

Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0

How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . â€¦ â€¦ 	1
Hamas isn ' t targeting civilians . . . . " , then maybe a course in English would be a logical step for you BEFORE engaging in disscuasions in that particular language . 	0

I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0

South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0

When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0

That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0

San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks , with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there , so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead . 	0
Probably true of Boston as well , but in SF ' s case , the city is seen as a " gay " city , much more so than , say , New York is known as a " Jewish " city ( pace Jesse Jackson ' s unfortunate remarks ) . 	0
Point taken about New York and Jews ; in defense , I ' d say the difference here is that the perceived ( and actual ) character of San Francisco is more inextricably bound up with its larger-than-average share of gay , lesbian , etc . , people . 	0

If you ' re suggesting that the tone of the current article is fear-mongering , then I disagree . 	0
I ' m afraid I don ' t understand your post . 	0
A MVA Manual_vacuum_aspiration , with WHO ( anybody know their copyright status ? ) pictures at [ [ 9 ] ] , makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple , and not even that interestingly graphic . 	0
Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
There has been an attempt to build consensus for what are reasonable deviations from the US place name guideline . 	0
But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0
No longer are we just relying on highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science , but rather we are open to including skeptic groups , notable academics and researchers , etc . So now we are not definitively labelling anything pseudoscience . 	0
Am I an editor refusing to allow " any mention " of it in the article ? 	1
No . 	1
Wassap , I don ' t see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short . 	1
The three reasons for keeping the sex abuse section short are : it has its own article , and to make it longer violates WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0

Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : â€” 	0
" The article on amputation shows a hand minus two fingers . 	0

I may add something about those if Wassupwestcoast insists on expanding on the bad - just so we have balance but I really think that such an approach will make the article too long . 	1

I can ' t imagine more than three US citizens liking " First Master " , and newspapers would have a field day . 	0
The choice of term is politically touchy , and the female candidate ' s team will have chosen and popularized the " best " one , for instance by mentioning it casually on morning talk shows , well before the nominating convention so that it doesn ' t become a campaign issue . 	0
The word " Lady " in " First Lady " comes from her social role , and hence " First Master " , although doubtful , is possible . 	0
" First Husband " has also been hypothesized , although the article does not propose it . 	0
It isn ' t an issue of peerage , it is a question of social etiquette . 	1

I certainly hope , along with many others , that this finding will lead to a true cure for HIV infection . 	0
At the same time , our enthusiasm for this report must be tempered by a realistic view of both the history of sensational announcements in HIV research and our goals at Wikipedia . 	1
From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1
The recent announcement by Gero HÃ¼tter , first in the media and later as a case report in the NEJM , is quite notable and also very encouraging . 	0
What do other users think about this and about the relative weight the Berlin case should be assigned ? 	0
It is not principally to reflect sectional press-led emphasis on a US scandal , which in fact shows that Catholic priests have been accused of abuse at about the same rate as those of any other denomination or secular profession . 	1

" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0

" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
Is that correct ? " 	0
And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1

You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0

They must be accepted with respect , compassion , and sensitivity . 	0
They do not choose their homosexual condition ; for most of them it is a trial . 	0
These persons are called to fulfill God ' s will in their lives and , if they are Christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord ' s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . 	0
Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0
If the athiests who keep coming to rewrite the article with POV don ' t actually read things like the Catechism then we can never hope for a real NPOV . 	0

For example , Wikipedia mentions notable criticisms of Barack Obama , but none are mentioned on the main page because of how strongly the editors there fight it . 	0
I would think consensus alone should not be enough to block mention of topics that are notable and reliably sourced . 	0
I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0
If the media and the public fails to grasp that , the public record of those official hearings is not irrelevant or subordinate ( or even equal ) to that . 	0

Why don ' t you just let the facts be told , and let people make up their own minds as to what conclusions to make . 	0
If your answer is no , then please do not hinder me ( or anyone else ) from contributing legitimate facts of truth to balance the obvious bias that is trying to be imposed on a legally elected governing body in order to shift readers to a specific viewpoint . 	0
if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

Before making such a statement and saying that the link between ancient Phoenicians and modern day Lebanese people is foolish , you need to show proof and cite sources . 	0

I ' m not up to it tonight , but perhaps by reiterating that " first lady " has the split meanings of presidential spouse / social hostess , it could be stated more clearly . 	0
P . S . - Follow-up note : I agree that the " female president " section could be made clearer . 	0
Karanacs , surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven ' t previously been involved in editing an article ? 	0
It doesn ' t read well as it is . 	0
Presumably a female President would still be the hostess , but it seems ridiculous to suggest the President could also be the First Lady at the same time ( unless the US has a lesbian President , and let ' s not go there . . . ) 	0
I think people are correct in saying there needs to be a distinction between the spouse of the President and the hostess at the White House . 	0
My dear Will , take a breath . 	0
Bush never dropped out of a specific church though , so the comparison really isn ' t applicable . 	1
I added a line about how this was resolved in a fictitious situation : President Mackenzie Allen ' s husband is titled First Gentleman but her mother eventually joins the white house as a de facto hostess . 	0
But I don ' t see why a First Gentleman couldn ' t perform all the functions of a ' hostess ' , if he was minded to do so . 	0
But here is the second , and very key , point to address - who would be the " hostess of the white house " ? 	0
By definition , the husband cannot be the hostess , so who would be ? 	0
It is all speculation , and it will probably be decided by the mainstream press as much as by the officeholder himself . 	0
" First Gentleman " seems to be the most likely candidate . 	0
Remember ; first lady has two meanings , " spouse of the president " and " hostess of the whitehouse " . 	0
So , in the case of a female president , what would we call her spouse ? 	0
I ' ve just tried putting some compromise language in that addresses both points . 	0

A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0
Further , if anyone would like to go ahead and address my substantive points above about what I view as this article ' s inherent bias , I think this article would benefit from that as well . 	0
These quesions are as follows : If anyone would like to begin by answering these questions , I think that would make an excellent jumping off point to discuss my inclusion of the NPOV article tagging . 	0

It would be a yes or a no situation - or as I say above - it would be a black-or-white situation . 	0
Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0

In the discussion at Wikipedia : In the news section on the Main Page / Candidates I made the comment that " I think what is important here is the fact that this news story is prompted by the Vatican itself . 	0
The Vatican traditionally has an ambition for world supremacy . 	0
Islam likewise . 	0
The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam . 	0
Apples and oranges aside , this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape , and as such , this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view . 	0
This is how I read this story , and from that reading this certainly appears big enough for an In The News feature . 	0
We could simply present it from the angle it has already been presented : The Vatican concedes Islam now bigger than Roman Catholicism . " 	0

Israel did everything possible to avoid civilian casualties , but it can ' t be 100% accurate when fighting against terrorists hiding among the civilian population . 	1

We need to be careful about how the word " skeptical " is being used here ( by you ) . 	0

The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1

The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
Now , as for sources . 	0
Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0
Unless there is a reliable source confirming verifiable proof of what seems now to only be accusations , I don ' t see eeason to change this article . - - 	0
We don ' t determine article content by tallying how many times a phrase is or isn ' t mentioned in a handful of online articles ( and that is a handful ; that ' s nowhere near the amount of press coverage the band has had in its career ) . 	0

( ec ) First of all , if Wikipedia could actually ruin Christmas , a lot of ass-clowns would have hijacked the Project for other purposes ; its an argument without merit . 	0
Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1
Thirdly , the Buddha / Siddhartha argument is closer to the point , but still falls short via definition . 	0

I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this , because of its historical significance . 	1
How do Wiki editors think this matter should be handled ? 	0
I remember reading in history books that Warren G . Harding was our first black President . 	0
He was only partially black but this information was not bandied about back then for obvious reasons â€¦ 	0
I think the Wiki article on Harding mentions his black ancestry . 	0
Harding even addressed the issue obliquely by saying that some of his ancestors " may have jumped the fence " . 	0

I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church â€¦ " . 	1

The Roman Catholic Church is the only one that officially calls itself the Catholic Church . 	0

Not only is HIV less than a century young , but HIV ' s relatives in primate species are all similarly recent in origin . 	0
It appears to have hopped from cows to primates to humans , with the HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in humans coming from different primate intermediaries . - - 	0
Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0

The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0

Interesting interpretations of the Anglo-Irish treaty aside , the Free State never had control over Northern Ireland . 	0

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding regarding the role of the UGLE and the Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon , which I attempted to clear up with my various edits . 	0
The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1

Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0

My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0
Is the section really a problem as is ? 	0
Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0
or we could trim the Origins and Mission section by more than half , turning it into an introductory paragraph to the main article , again with any important detail transferred to " history . " 	0

Isn ' t the material more appropriate for First Vision , though ? 	0
This article is not about the First Vision , it is a broad article about Mormonism in general . 	0
I don ' t see the rationale of including this information in this article . 	0
It also sounds like you are out to " prove " something is the case . 	1
The visits of the angel Moroni to Smith were emphasized by the early church much more than the First Vision , but the details of those visitations are not set out in this article â€” they are reserved for articles like Angel Moroni . 	0
To me it sounds like you are giving undue weight to the event which actually was not given a great amount of weight at the time . 	0
Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account â€” other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

Some reliable sources regarding the prevalence of HIV in people who have AIDS in Africa : PMID 19709731 highlights the alarming pattern of rising HIV incidence and prevalence followed by AIDS mortality , and another PMID 19709736 describing the burden of HIV and other communicable and non-communicable diseases there . 	0

Re the creed , I have always believed that removing its explicit presentation would be a good thing if space demands suggested it ( as it does here ) . 	0

While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown , there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV . 	1
By breaking out those sections as you encourage , it gives the article a slightly more assertive tone merely by this organization , which could be plausibly seen to be subtle POV . 	0
By keeping together content when it is intellectually coherent to do so ( as Karanacs alludes to ) , the tone becomes more descriptive , what IMO such an article should strive to be . 	0

[ 38 ] } } Ironically , Obama is asking Americans to place their trust in the abortion doctors making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in potentially harming other human beings , when it is not in their best interests to even reveal that children are surviving their abortions , let alone care for those children , as it could endanger their industry and cause unnecessary expense . 	0
The bill ' s purpose was reasonable , to ensure at least 2 physicians were accountable for verifying live-born children were not in fact surviving the abortions , to prevent the same " infanticide " that led Congress to declare partial birth abortion illegal . 	0

The newly rewritten intro - This is a list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skepticalorganizations , or by notable academics or researchers . . . - makes no mention of the organizations or people being only those with " mainstream " points of view . 	0
I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0

There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0

How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

There is no sound argument to back the assertion that " progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music " . 	0

I think what Wassupwestcoast is trying to say is that the scandal here is not really that a few priests did awful things , but that the church as an organization covered it up . 	0
The coverage in this article has focused more on the individual priests , when it really should instead talk about the bishops who moved priests around without informing the new dioceses of past problems . 	0
I haven ' t seen evidence that the level of cover-up that occurred in the RCC has also occurred in Protestant denominations ; if that ' s just my ignorance , then info on Protestant coverups could be offered as a comparison . 	0
Technically its right , but it could give the wrong impression hence the debate - - 	0

The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1
So the best thing to do is to just give a percentage . 	1
As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1

I appreciate you pointing out that you agree with that , and hope that you understand it was NOT my intention to imply that because of their status today , Hamas ' previous ( or present ) actions are to be define in a different way . 	0

This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0
Now , I realize we are talking about a global situation , and not just one that relates to the U . S . . 	0
Would it not seem logical , then , to specifically state that the designation / label / view of Hamas is a matter of debate / discussion / confussion within international community standards ? 	1

However , since the lead effectively dictates the article as a whole , it is much more appropriate to tag the entire article . 	1
If I could tag one thing specifically , it would be the lead , especially the inclusion criteria . 	0
Do you at least agree that it is inappropriate to remove the { { bias } } tag without proper consenus ? 	0
I am perplexed that you two ( Eldereft and Fyslee ) are saying that the tag should be removed , when all efforts to install such a tag have been summarily reverted without the benefit of a proper discussion . 	1

It seems like we are spending too much time discussing what is and isn ' t proper in terms of tagging , rather than discussing the heart of this issue . 	0
Our current inclusion criteria would definitely allow sourced mention , especially since it is not us who are characterizing , but the sources . 	1
The situation is that it qualifies as Questionable science , and because " some critics allege to be pseudoscience , may contain information to that effect , but generally should not be so characterized . " 	0
It ' s all a matter of how the mainstream changes its views on things , and on how the V & RS document that change . 	0
Who knows , at some point in time psychoanalysis may become a historical artifact that will easily fall into the " Generally considered pseudoscience " or " Obvious pseudoscience " class , and we ' ll then be justified in adding PS category tags to the articles ! 	0

As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0

Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0

As efforts to significantly stanch the leak or entirely prevent the oil from reaching the coast continued , some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident , including a perceived lack of involvement by Obama and the federal government .

Lastly , you are vandalizing the article because you are inserting content against consensus ( or at least , without one ) , not to mention the little effort that was apparently put in to proper spelling and capitalization in the edits . 	1
We will need some mainstream sources that use , or discuss the use , of the IOF as an alternative name to IDF , not sources that accuse IDF of occupation , which is a completely different issue . 	0
In general , when trying to insert an alternative term for any article name , this needs to have some official or mainstream credibility , and the guidelines are more stringent than for representing two opposing viewpoints in the article ' s content . 	0
They refer to Israeli forces as occupiers , but do not use the term Israeli Occupation Forces ( notice the capitalization ) as an alternative to Israel Defense Forces ( you are trying to insert a passage into the article which says that the IDF is also called IOF by some , which is not supported by Sean Hoyland ' s articles , and is well-known to represent a fringe point of view â€” see WP : FRINGE ) . 	0

I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1

In any case , I will chime in when I read anything that makes me reconsider ( or reaffirm ) my position . 	0
It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations , something that I think we all agree should be avoided , whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest . 	0
Given the existence of both the history and theology subarticles , there seems ample opportunity to flesh out these connections in places the context makes it clear we are being descriptive . 	0

I wasn ' t suggesting putting it in the lead . 	0
It ' s true that it isn ' t a legal or national title ( although who knows , maybe its usage is mandated by certain sources in their official communications , I don ' t know ) but its presence in RS does indicate that it is some kind of alternate name ( and its validity doesn ' t come into it ) . 	0
' a vocal minority aren ' t capable of intellectual thought process ' , given that there is consensus within the international community about a set of things called the Israeli occupied territories it ' s hardly surprising that the IOF term would exist and be used in RS and as part of the defense vs occupation narrative war ( which is , in my view , very similar to the settlement vs neighborhood narrative war ) . 	0

The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

Halford and Dunn ' s opinions were used as a reference to depict a certain viewpoint in the Traditional Heavy Metal article . 	0
Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
There is presumption ( logical and statistically supported , but still presumption ) of HIV infection as the cause of their deaths . 	0
In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes . [ 161 ] " Also , I ' m changing the wording back about South Africa ' s AIDS denialism ; phrasing it as HIV-AIDS link makes it sound like the link is shakey or something . 	0
While consensus can block sources due to a lack of quality , it cannot block simply because they claim consensus . 	0

More extensive description should , IMO , address issues such as the fact that most AIDS victims in Africa were never confirmed as HIV positive by testing . 	1
I have previously commented in Talk on the irrelevance of social issues such as orphans in the lead of an article about a virus ( which is NOT the same as the syndrome , which is a specific medical term distinct from disease ) . 	0
To me , this suggests that the HIV article needs " more extensive description " , including possible revision of the lead . 	1
The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W .

We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0

I have replied several times that the term " main " has been removed from anything having to do with Butters . 	0

We should explain just enough so that lay people can understand how it does or does not apply to evolution . 	0

If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0
In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0
The result will be an article that will educate a much wider circle of readers , and more effectively . 	0
The article does not address them adequately ; especially as an FA article . 	0

How about an actual number of the victims of the abusers ? 	0
This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0
This inclusion criteria of this article relies on notability of the source - not relevance or influence in the real world . 	0

Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0
Scientology ' s point of view here may not be reliable , but it is undeniably notable . 	0

It won ' t solve all the problems , but it would at least minimize them . 	1
But at least as a " List of pseudosciences " using WP : PSCI , it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category : Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo - , proto - , and fringe science . 	0
This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0
Absolutely . 	0
There will always be grey . 	0

If we were to include all the information that Wassupwestcoast wants us to include about the abuse scandal in the article , we would violate WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0

It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1
Fearful of this happening to them , Catholics supported tough measures against protestants - who weren ' t fighting for religious toleration , but for their right to impose their religion on everyone else . 	0

nor did i bring up the issue where the IDF is stationed mostly , this is irrelevant , there is a significant portion of the media world wide that uses that term , regarding being undue , well , the occupation of westbank , gaza strip and golan was performed by and only by the IDF , currently it is the only occupying army in the context of the Palestinian israili conflict ! 	0
well , i never said anything about renaming the article Â  ! ! 	0
this is all irrelevent , BUT sources such as aljazeera . net [ 5 ] , the palestinian center for human rights [ 6 ] , and reliefweb [ 7 ] are examples of sources which do use the term IOF instead of IDF . 	0
it is and has been ( i . e . the occupation ) a hot topic in the news for the last 42 + years ! ! 	0
the claim that the reason it is used is to demonize the israeli army or not is also irrelevant to this discussion . 	0
The Congregation first recalled the 25 January 1974 declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that " there is no doubt whatsoever " regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using " for all " as a translation of " pro multis " , since " for all " corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ ' s intention expressed in the words of the consecration , and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all ( cf . John 11 : 52 , 2 Â  Corinthians 5 : 14-15 , Titus 2 : 11 , 1 Â  John 2 : 2 ) . 	0

Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0
And the whole passage strongly implies that corruption was throughly endemic within the Church , when research shows that most parishes operated normally , donations , pilgrimages and church-building continued at their former levels . 	0
If no progress is made , the article may be delisted , which can then later be renominated at WP : GAN . 	1

It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
So the question is , surely , whether NI remained in the UKGBI in 1922 . 	0
Northern Ireland was in the UKGBI between 1922 til 1927 when UK was renamed as UKGBNI . 	0
It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1

This was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led some to accuse him of anti-Semitism .

In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0
also , false is a needless judgement when the facts of the matter are a click away . 	1
also the words " much " are ommitable i suggest that this sentence will be true to the facts of the matter and invite people to continue and read the appropriate section . 	0

Popular discourse elevates Sabbath ' s importance to the detriment of their contemporaries , when even a basic review of the most important and in-depth sources on metal establish that Sabbath wasn ' t the sole progenitor of metal , and they weren ' t as unique as some believe them to be . 	0

You probably feel that a section about Jolie ' s tattoos is trivial detail , but I feel that they are notable enough to be mentioned ( seeing as they are a big part of her life . . . and career if you count how they are emphasized in one or two of her films ) . 	1

A lot of these celebrities are also well-known for their romantic relationships , such as Brad Pitt and Jolie . 	0
I do not feel that having a section about that , as long as it ' s well-sourced and well-worded ( and appropriate ) , is unencyclopedic . 	0
I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0
I get your point somewhat . 	0
But to say that Personal life sections ( which by the way , do not have to be titled Personal life , as noted with the Angelina Jolie article ) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with . 	0

In your response on the First Lady talk page , you made a statement that you had no such proof to the affirm the statements that I included on the origins as they relate to Great Britian . 	0

This argument is completely irrelevant and wrong , first , because MA was referring the " occupying Zionist regime " . 	1

If you want to introduce changes - fine . 	0
I strongly suggest , then , that you post your proposed changes here first , allow some discussion , then introduce them , rather than just making a string of edits . 	0
Look at the prior archive 11 , for example , for a long discussion on the wording of the disambiguation whatnot . 	0

I don ' t think it ' s helpful to think of it in terms of " many , many more [ governments ] do not consider [ Hamas ] a terrorist organization . " 	1

The scandals have not been covered only in the US ( nor have they occured only in the US ) . 	0
There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe , and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC , so it ' s not necessarily a new thing either . 	0
The first part of the first sentence ( " A sex abuse scandal involving around 0 . 02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse " ) sounds fine . 	0

The scandal is prominently enough mentioned in its due position 	0
It would make the Us scandal one of the key incidents in Christian history ! 	0
The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead . 	0
Placing it in the lead gives it undue prominence in relevance to the church . 	0
This is the first time such a demand has been made , and it is utterly unreasonable . 	1
There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article . 	0
Unless similar things appear in the leads for all other religious organisations and secular ones too . 	0
This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade â€” 1991-2000 . 	0
To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases â€” which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape â€” could be much higher . 	0
According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions â€” one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

Since sexual deviancy is a characteristic of human beings , and not just Catholics , as a WP editor with the quality of the article in mind , I second Storm Rider ' s opinion that mention of sexual abuse by clergy does not belong in the lead . 	1
Westcoast , as far as I can tell Storm Rider ' s argument is not that the problem is that of " a collection of a few sinful individuals " but that the normal rates of human sexual deviance are going to be found in the Catholic Church . 	0

The 48-hour hiatus was a technical step which ( so far as I am aware ) had no practical consequence . 	0
The anon IP does have a point in this edit . 	0
However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail â€¦ but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

So , given that this article is not a list of definitive pseudosciences but rather just a list of topics that have been characterized as such , to exist and still satisfy WP : NPOV , this article must represent " fairly , and as far as possible without bias , all significant views that have been published by reliable sources " . 	0
Furthermore , the first reference [ 1 ] , is to the most current Abbott Labs ELISA instruction insert , and the second 2 references are the statistical references used by Abbott , the ELISA manufacturer , to reference statistical HIV to AIDS progression . 	0
I propose that paragraph 3 of the lead be edited to reflect the following changes : " The risk of an asymptomatic person with a repeatedly reactive serum sample ( for HIV ) developing AIDS or an AIDS-related condition is not known . 	1
However , in a prospective study , AIDS developed in 51% of homosexual men after 10 years of infection .

Dance-Pop is a fusion genre of Dance Music and Pop Music it is a mix and fusion genres are not allowed into a template according to " Infobox Musical Artist Template " So Dance would probably be a genre for her cause it was on all of her three albums . 	1

Also , Brown Haired girl , I don ' t see on Wikipedia that it ' s necessary to always ' compromise ' - sometimes certain people want to imply a position to push a zealous political agenda , and that is something that is very hard to compromise with ( and should not be done ) 	1
The added benefit here is that you don ' t have any PoV implications . 	0

Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1
Why in a summary are there no details about many of the other events during the Viking and Norman ages , but for this particular event you feel compelled to add minute and misleading detail . 	0
O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0

Still , I am reasonable enough to agree to keep it out if you present some other argument ( other than censorship ) 	0
I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

As I said recently , the lead should focus on scientific facts , with minimal mention of social consequences . 	1
Highlighting orphans in the lead here ( rather than only in the main body of text on HIV ) is itself an example of undue weight , because it over-dramatizes the social aspect of an article about a virus . 	1

Undue weight on AIDS consequences in the HIV article leads to an undercurrent of HIV = AIDS , conflating the virus with the syndrome . 	0

If nothing passes muster here on Talk , I am clearly OK with not mentioning it in the lede at all , but the effort is worth it , an ounce of prevention . . . 	0
So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

I also agree that too many people are out to use the article to score political points , not to create an encyclopedia . 	0

Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0
You are very confused about evolution . 	0
Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity . 	0

The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0
" Highway Star " and " War Pigs " are kind of hard to compare in my opinion . 	0

I think maybe anywhere from In Rock to Machine Head could have been it , though I think their ' 60s material was much more exclusively hard rock . 	0
" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0

Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0

Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit â€” realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s â€” and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
