So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0

At the moment we have no mention at all in the article of US support - the title of this thread . 	0

The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1
Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article ? 	0

Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0
Am I an editor refusing to allow " any mention " of it in the article ? 	1
No . 	1
Wassap , I don ' t see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short . 	1
The three reasons for keeping the sex abuse section short are : it has its own article , and to make it longer violates WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0
I also agree partially , But I ' m not saying give the latest scandal , just give them the truth , many times people come to wiki for the truth , after they read some scandal within the tabloids . 	0

Before making such a statement and saying that the link between ancient Phoenicians and modern day Lebanese people is foolish , you need to show proof and cite sources . 	0
Everyone knows the Lebanese couldn ' t possibly be descendants of the Phoenicians ? 	0

Saying that the Lebanese people are not decendants of the Phoenicians is kind of strong . 	0

That won ' t do at all ; it ' s best for the New World we live in today , if most people don ' t think too hard about such things . 	0
We probably can ' t stop them from thinking this foolishness , but at least we can do what little we can , by scoffing to scorn anyone who suggests such a fallacy on the internet . 	0

I ' m not up to it tonight , but perhaps by reiterating that " first lady " has the split meanings of presidential spouse / social hostess , it could be stated more clearly . 	0

It doesn ' t read well as it is . 	0
Presumably a female President would still be the hostess , but it seems ridiculous to suggest the President could also be the First Lady at the same time ( unless the US has a lesbian President , and let ' s not go there . . . ) 	0

The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0

I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

' Zionist regime ' is a redirect to ' Zionist entity ' , so your links were to ' Zionist entity ' as Wayne said . 	1

I just noticed the article has a tag reading " Note : Do not add " hard rock " here . 	0
I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0

I was merely suggesting that completely dismissing it may be a step too far NPOV-wise given its presence in RS and that perhaps it should be mentioned sonewhere . 	0
I wasn ' t suggesting putting it in the lead . 	0
It ' s true that it isn ' t a legal or national title ( although who knows , maybe its usage is mandated by certain sources in their official communications , I don ' t know ) but its presence in RS does indicate that it is some kind of alternate name ( and its validity doesn ' t come into it ) . 	0
' a vocal minority aren ' t capable of intellectual thought process ' , given that there is consensus within the international community about a set of things called the Israeli occupied territories it ' s hardly surprising that the IOF term would exist and be used in RS and as part of the defense vs occupation narrative war ( which is , in my view , very similar to the settlement vs neighborhood narrative war ) . 	0

The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0
