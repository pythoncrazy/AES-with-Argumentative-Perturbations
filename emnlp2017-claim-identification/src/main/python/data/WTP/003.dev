I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0

Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0

And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1

This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

[ 38 ] } } Ironically , Obama is asking Americans to place their trust in the abortion doctors making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in potentially harming other human beings , when it is not in their best interests to even reveal that children are surviving their abortions , let alone care for those children , as it could endanger their industry and cause unnecessary expense . 	0
The bill ' s purpose was reasonable , to ensure at least 2 physicians were accountable for verifying live-born children were not in fact surviving the abortions , to prevent the same " infanticide " that led Congress to declare partial birth abortion illegal . 	0

I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes .

But please take a look at WP : AGF , please do stop commenting on other editors and focus on the sources and content . 	0

Talking about it here is better . 	0
In answer to you question , yes , a reference from a medical journal would be great , although we can consider other sources . 	0
I agree with that in general , but it seems to me that a reliable newspaper is a good enough source to justify putting in something from it , if qualified , and that ' s the edit I made . 	0
But it was reverted , and now we have a small edit war here , and we should stop that right away . 	0
Well , here ' s why you should . 	0
You want to add material to the article , and thus the burden is on you to provide sources , and you have supplied some , but some editors are not happy with those sources , my guess is that the basic objection is that these sources are not as good as others available . 	1
But if there are any medical journal articles that address this , yes , please let ' s take a look at those . 	0

- Well , I can ' t speak for Wikiscient , but I assume it ' s for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly : The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image , another very specific case of death . 	0
Whether an oil-painting or the photograph of a real human skull , as suggested by Nk . sheridan above ( at the bottom of the paragraph " Lead image question again " ) , I don ' t really care . 	0
@Wingspeed : You say that " . . . for similar reasons I don ' t think the dead soldier is , either . " 	0
If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0
Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
Without the caption , especially at the low image size in the article , it ' s just a person lying on the ground , apparently badly wounded , but not necessarily dead at first glance . 	0

Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0

Some can be inserted in the budget section while being aware of the caveats mentioned by Ynhockey above . 	0
The reference to a lot of the aid being tied to equipment purchases is appropriate in the equipment section where you originally inserted a mention of US aid . 	0
Okay . 	0
You ' ve got some sources ( and an indication of annually published sources for more up to date figures ) there to insert something more specific than a reference to " generous " military aid . 	0
In August 2007 , the Bush Administration announced that it would increase U . S . military assistance to Israel by $6 billion over the next decade . 	0
For FY2008 , Israel is receiving $2 . 4 billion in Foreign Military Financing ( FMF ) . 	0
A see also would also be relevant . --12 : 18 , 21 September 2009 ( UTC ) http://opencrs.com/document/RL33222/ U . S . military aid has helped transform Israel ’ s armed forces into one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world . 	0

The agreement calls for incremental annual increases in FMF to Israel , reaching $3 . 1 billion a year by FY2018 . 1 . . . 	0
Most analysts consider Israel ’ s ability to use a significant portion of its annual military aid for procurement spending in Israel to be a valuable aspect of its assistance package ; no other recipient of U . S . military assistance has been granted this benefit . 	0

I don ' t really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier ( though again a more " neutral " John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better ) . 	0
If you want to put up a morgue or med-school shot of some anonymous " John / Jane Doe " corpse , I ' d probably be okay with that ( depending in that case however entirely on how likely it seems that some reader out there might be surprised and disturbed to see a deceased relative or loved-one representing this topic - - which again is just another aspect of the same reasoning and in the same way something that Wikipedia probably ought to avoid here . . . ) . 	0

That ' s all . 	0
Choosing a lead image that also contains representations of the subjects of other articles weakens the effect , is distracting , is potentially confusing , and depending on the " other subjects " in question might easily be interpreted as editorial bias ( to the extent , in the case of the Pope , for example , of possibly causing offense to some readers ) . 	0

There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0

This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
