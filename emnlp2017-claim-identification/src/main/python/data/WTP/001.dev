In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

The list ' s title and inclusion criteria make it clear that this is NOT solely a list of WP : PSCI ' s " obvious pseudosciences " and " generally considered pseudosciences " . 	1
We can and do include " questionable science " , as well as " alternative theoretical formulations " , and even majority views , if sourced properly . 	0
Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
Yes , of course it should . 	0
That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0

But again , this is all irrelevant to our dispute here . 	0
The point is here , WP : TERRORIST policy is clear , because usually there is in the story more than " someone is a terrorist " . 	0
And I don ' t see difference between calling someone a terrorist or saying that he uses terrorist tactics . 	0

On the topic of citations : a good counter citation would be one that discredits the current disppute of his connections with the UGLE or regular freemasonry . 	0

Provided the items are discussed in the article in the relevant section , then having illustrations is entirely appropriate . 	1
If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
I think there might be confusion here . 	0
@Eldereft . 	0
Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0
So what , specifically , are you objecting to here ? 	0

I agree with your comments , 	0
So saying there is no negative information in an article is no kind of argument . 	1
Say what you want to be included and why , and again be specific . 	0

We need to be careful about how the word " skeptical " is being used here ( by you ) . 	0

I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0

The band helped to create the genre with ground breaking releases such as Paranoid , an album that Rolling Stone magazine said " changed music forever " , and called the band " the Beatles of heavy metal " . " This paragraph is rightfully phrased as representation of an opinion . 	0

The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1
As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1

However , every book dealing with 1967 also discusses its various battles which are not mentioned in this article , and I don ' t think they should be . 	1
For example , with all due respect to the Battle of Ammunition Hill , likely more significant in the long term than the Liberty incident , it simply did not impact the IDF in a major way to be included here . 	0

I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1

It would follow Wikipedia guidelines better if say discussion of scandals associated with particular wars occurred in the place where those wars are mentioned and if the more extreme ethical abuses were included in the discussion of the ethical cide . 	0
Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0

So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1

Furthermore , according to that same article , " Likewise , exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources , and , with clear editorial consensus , unreliable sources for exceptional claims may be rejected due to a lack of quality . " 	0

Until and unless one of the abovementioned things , or some other major detail , arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end , I really don ' t see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers . 	0
Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0

We should explain just enough so that lay people can understand how it does or does not apply to evolution . 	0
If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0
In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0
The result will be an article that will educate a much wider circle of readers , and more effectively . 	0

False dichotomy . 	0
It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1
Will it ultimately lead to a major shift in energy policy , or a major environmental and engineering response ? 	0
In a nutshell , I ' d propose this : We can include any topic that has been called PS by a reliable source ( whether or not said source is " right " or reflects a majority scientific view ) . 	1

Frankly , I think actually classifying the album itself ( Sabbath Bloody Sabbath ) as " progressive metal " is rather drastic , despite the current state of Wiki ' s article on it . 	0
While we ' re housecleaning polls , can somebody explain why the Siena College poll , currently at the end of the section , belongs here in its current form ? 	0

One does not need to look hard to find reliable recent articles detailing the trouble of the Catholic church worldwide as an organization rather than as a collection of a few sinful individuals . 	0

The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

Wikipedia ' s page on Criticism simply defines it as " the judgement ( using analysis and evaluation ) of the merits and faults of the actions or work of another individual . " 	0
Criticism by many reliable definitions would simply be negative statements . 	1
I have a hard time believing you ' re trying to place as a definition of criticism that it has to have basis in fact . 	0
Logically then , I ' m not sure where you ' re coming up with this definition of the word . 	0
According to Princeton ' s definition , for example , a critic can be defined simply as " someone who frequently finds fault or makes harsh and unfair judgments " . 	0
Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

Perhaps someone can correct me , as I ' m far from an expert on Islam ; but it doesn ' t seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism , Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate " faiths " , while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith . 	0
( It may , however , be the case that even Sunni Muslims , who make up about 85% of Muslims , outnumber Catholics ; but that doesn ' t seem to be the story as presented ) . 	0
The two aren ' t really comparable , though , are they ? 	1
Christianity , with around two billion members , is the largest faith . 	0
The Roman Catholic Church , with around a billion members , is the largest single religious body . 	0
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies ; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church , but it isn ' t larger than Christianity and isn ' t a single body ( there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi ' a for a start ) , so I don ' t actually think that this is an especially significant fact . 	0
