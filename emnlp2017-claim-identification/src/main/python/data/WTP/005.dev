If there was a universal common ancestor , then evolution would produce all current biodiversity we see today from this organisms . 	0
Again , notice that argueing for biodiversity we use evolutionary forces . 	0
Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0
So different lines of evidence are used to attack each question . 	0
Two different lines of evidence that fit rather nicely into the theory of evolution . 	0

Whether a source is secondary or primary is subject to the individual . 	0
If we follow the logic stated by JohnBlackBurne we ' d be left in the article with little more than readers opinions and very little works cited . 	0

For those who view the statement as bias , remember that it is also a quote , which is different than statements in the article . 	1
Please see first paragraph again , and please post another reliable source if you wish to dispute the fact . 	0
For reference , please review other articles that use quotes in their article . 	0
By quoting other sources instead of just writing without quotes , this alerts to the reader that the quote is different than the other statements in that it may come from a bias source ( which is not saying a source is necessarily bias ) , and so dissipates any hidden bias which keeps with the neutrality of the article . 	0

Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
Yes , of course it should . 	0
That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0
I welcome the NPOV tag , until the opinions of all notable persons / organizations are allowed to be included and all opinions / statements are properly attributed in-text . 	0

The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1

To truly be labelled a pseudoscience , as per WP : PSCI , the topic must be an Obvious pseudoscience or Generally considered pseudoscience . 	0
While some of the entries on this list are definitive pseudosciences , some of the entries are not . 	0
The problem as I see it stems from that this article is NOT a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of topics that have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	1
I am going to tag this entire article with POV issues tag . 	0
Currently , this article violates this fundemental principle of Wikipedia because it is purposefully excluding certain significant views on what characterizes a pseudoscience . 	1
I don ' t really love that we are sidestepping aroung a piece of WP : NPOV , but that is what we are working with at the moment . 	0

( Note that the word " skeptical " links not to skepticism but rather to scientific skepticism . ) 	0
The recently changed inclusion criteria in the lead limits the viewpoints to just those of " organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skeptical organizations , or by notable academics or researchers " , thus excluding a great deal of significant views that are not necessarily part of this limiting criteria . 	0

Clarification of my position on this : The inclusion criteria on this list should conform to WP : PSCI . 	0

However , I do not see why Levine2112 , Ludwigs2 , and Unomi think that there is a problem with WP : PSCI as is . 	0

The definition of holocaust denial ( according to wikipedia ) is : " Holocaust denial consists of claims that the genocide of Jews during World War II — usually referred to as the Holocaust [ 1 ] — did not occur at all , or that it did not happen in the manner or to the extent historically recognized .

Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0
Further , if anyone would like to go ahead and address my substantive points above about what I view as this article ' s inherent bias , I think this article would benefit from that as well . 	0
These quesions are as follows : If anyone would like to begin by answering these questions , I think that would make an excellent jumping off point to discuss my inclusion of the NPOV article tagging . 	0
My concern is with the newspaper stuff . 	0

Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0

Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0
