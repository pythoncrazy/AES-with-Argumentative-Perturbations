In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0
Martin gets off very lightly . 	0

There are also multiple organizations , notably Breaking the Silence , that deal specifically with this issue ( see above discussion with Deborahjay ) , and there is a main article for the recent controversy . 	0
If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1

And Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band ( musicians like Dave Mustaine , Mikael Åkerfeldt , Dee Snider , Scott Ian , and many others cite them as such ) , but they proved that they could be a little diverse and do folk , blues , some reggae and funk influences , etc . , etc . 	1

RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0

As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0

Some people have shown impatience with the listing of Catholic positives in the article . 	0
Then a historian who wondered how these Spanish torture devices had reached Sussex discovered not only that the Spanish Inquisition never used these type of devices , but that they were all local and British-made . 	0
The point is that a balance has to be achieved between positive and negative . 	0
These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0
Further to Karanacs objections : The article is necessarily broad-brush . 	1
It cannot deal with every incident and nuance over the past 2000 years , especially if populist pressure tends toward putting in only hegative issues and leaving out the positive . 	0
A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
Where and when ? 	0
" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0
Francis Xavier didn ' t only " evangelise " Thomas christians , but non-christians as well . 	0

The communist view of history is like " Whig history " - a review of history from a political perspective - in this case anti-monarchal , anti-aristocratic and athiestic . 	0
The effeminate mope revision of its earlier history stems from the late 1700s , after rebels in the north were influenced by the naturalistic ideology of the Jacobin Club ( see also Gand Orient of France ) ; like the Rousseauian concept of the " noble savage " for instance , which is a prominent feature . 	0

As efforts to significantly stanch the leak or entirely prevent the oil from reaching the coast continued , some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident , including a perceived lack of involvement by Obama and the federal government . [ 1 ] Following a month-long series of Congressional hearings , Obama officially began a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to review the matter and recommend steps to avoid similar events in the future . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The bit about Obama visiting the Gulf coast is clunky and out-of-date ( he is there today ) , so that will also need fixing . 	1

I would suggest something more like this : Following a blowout at an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , President Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to review and report on the events surrounding incident . 	0

The fact is that the only major state to attempt religious toleration was Catholic France . 	0
It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1
Fearful of this happening to them , Catholics supported tough measures against protestants - who weren ' t fighting for religious toleration , but for their right to impose their religion on everyone else . 	0
It should most likely be removed . 	1

Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0

You probably feel that a section about Jolie ' s tattoos is trivial detail , but I feel that they are notable enough to be mentioned ( seeing as they are a big part of her life . . . and career if you count how they are emphasized in one or two of her films ) . 	1
A lot of these celebrities are also well-known for their romantic relationships , such as Brad Pitt and Jolie . 	0
I do not feel that having a section about that , as long as it ' s well-sourced and well-worded ( and appropriate ) , is unencyclopedic . 	0
I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0
I get your point somewhat . 	0
But to say that Personal life sections ( which by the way , do not have to be titled Personal life , as noted with the Angelina Jolie article ) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with . 	0

This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0
The 48-hour hiatus was a technical step which ( so far as I am aware ) had no practical consequence . 	0
The anon IP does have a point in this edit . 	0
However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

Perhaps someone can correct me , as I ' m far from an expert on Islam ; but it doesn ' t seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism , Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate " faiths " , while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith . 	0
( It may , however , be the case that even Sunni Muslims , who make up about 85% of Muslims , outnumber Catholics ; but that doesn ' t seem to be the story as presented ) . 	0
The two aren ' t really comparable , though , are they ? 	1
Christianity , with around two billion members , is the largest faith . 	0
The Roman Catholic Church , with around a billion members , is the largest single religious body . 	0
Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies ; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church , but it isn ' t larger than Christianity and isn ' t a single body ( there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi ' a for a start ) , so I don ' t actually think that this is an especially significant fact . 	0
All of these are far less significant than the oil spill . 	0

In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0
