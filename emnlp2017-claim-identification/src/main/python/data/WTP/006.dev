Nu metal is just an umbrella term used to describe all metal bands that add elements of alternative or rap music to their music . 	0
Saying System of a Down is alternative metal and not nu metal is like saying Limp Bizkit is rap metal instead of nu metal . 	0
System of a Down is alternative metal which is a subgenre of nu metal . 	0

I ' m off to bed so I won ' t be able to respond any time soon to further questions , but I do think we need to focus on content , not on personalities . 	0
So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0

I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
they are not . 	0
That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0
Roland was quite right to point out that facts and theories are different . 	0

I vote to keep the sentence . 	1
After considering the sentence everyone is discussing about removing in the lead , I think it really fits and ties up well the sentences that precede it . 	0
Removing it will leave a hole in logic and prevent the reader from knowing a key detail about what the church thinks about itself . 	0
The list ' s title and inclusion criteria make it clear that this is NOT solely a list of WP : PSCI ' s " obvious pseudosciences " and " generally considered pseudosciences " . 	1

Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
Yes , of course it should . 	0
That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0

In recent years , abuse of minors by representatives of the Catholic church made headlines throughout the world , further tarnishing the church ' s image . " 	0
How about : " A number of church teachings , such as those labeling abortion , contraception , homosexual intercourse and euthanasia as evil , are a frequent source of controversy today . 	0
While that may fix some problems , it introduces many more : the grammar is unclear , there is a sentence fragment , and there ' s at least one misspelling . 	0
Presently , you have : " Antireligious challenges faced by the church include its pro-life stance on abortion , contraception and euthanasia . 	0
The sentence at the top is close to the reworking that I gave the earlier sentence , and I agree that it can be improved . 	1
You are wrong , for reasons I have already explained . 	0
Primary sources should be used sparingly , and where there is controversy , not at all ( even the guideline you cite below makes this point clear ) . 	1
You may wish to make the Catholic Church all about abuse scandals , but that doesn ' t make it acceptable to skew the entire article . 	0
if people are that interested in it , they will find a link in the article . 	0
The " controversy " has the prominence it deserves . 	0

I would question the wisdom of using any book that does not have this designation while creating the Beliefs section unless you intend to use the book to present a criticism or opposing viewpoint that is clearly stated as such . 	1
I checked your new source " Catholicism : New Study Edition--Completely Revised and Updated by Richard P . Mcbrien " This book is written by the famous controversial professor of Notre Dame and does not have a Nihil Obstat or Imprimatur like my sources do . 	0
Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur means that the book is declared to be free of doctrinal and moral error by the church . 	0
But phone calls , unrelated estate claims and biographies of other people will not work either ( unless its the biography of a regular freemason who initiated Crowley , or the estate has information not previously published , but is now publishing ) . 	0
Lets try this and see if it works : I think this accurately depicts what is being disputed , who is disputing , and why they have the authority to dispute in the first place . 	0
We can ' t use words like some , as they ' re weasel words . 	0
We need to phrase it so that it accurately depicts who is saying what , and why , without going too far . 	0
On the topic of citations : a good counter citation would be one that discredits the current disppute of his connections with the UGLE or regular freemasonry . 	0
If you have these , then when can create a new section in the article that delves deeper into the matter and explores his connections with freemasonry . 	0
Removing the entire section wasn ' t a positive move toward change . 	0
I agree that there is a problem and I thank you for pointing this out . 	0

The most ghits seem to be found supporting that Rihanna is R&B , then pop , and I only found that allmusic source supporting reggae . 	0
On the other hand , more references can be found describing Rihanna as pop and R&B ( for pop , ghits for : rihanna " pop singer " , rihanna " pop star " ; for R&B , ghits for : rihanna " r&b singer " ) . 	1
Very few references can be found to support that Rihanna is a reggae singer , all I managed to find was her allmusic page which lists reggae after pop , and lists both as styles under the main genre R&B . 	1

If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0

As for , # 1 : no , the lede doesn ' t need to be reduced to four paragraphs : four paragraphs is suggested as a guideline , with exceptions . 	1

Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . … … 	1
Hamas isn ' t targeting civilians . . . . " , then maybe a course in English would be a logical step for you BEFORE engaging in disscuasions in that particular language . 	0

Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1

As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0
If the media and the public fails to grasp that , the public record of those official hearings is not irrelevant or subordinate ( or even equal ) to that . 	0

The breaking of racial boundaries , as you call it , is rather a mark of unique STYLE ( a personal variation to a pre-existing genre ) , than in itself a SUB-GENRE ( a full fledged movement with a local scene , possesing a notably different musical aesthetic and format , having many bands composing in a similar vein and so forth ) . 	1

Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

If someone says something more complicated like " Occupying Zionist regime " you could link it to Israel or Zionist entity or Israeli government or who knows , Revisionist Zionism etc etc .

It seems a simple solution to your concern would be to move or copy the relevant material to the other article ; we are thus guaranteed of having access to the material currently here which is valued by those arguing for keeping it . 	0
Re the moves , I understand that this really is an editorial decision , but one that does have other implications , as you allude to ( although ones I did not understand ; see below ) . 	0
While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown , there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV . 	1
By breaking out those sections as you encourage , it gives the article a slightly more assertive tone merely by this organization , which could be plausibly seen to be subtle POV . 	0
By keeping together content when it is intellectually coherent to do so ( as Karanacs alludes to ) , the tone becomes more descriptive , what IMO such an article should strive to be . 	0

This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0

I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0

So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1

The anon IP does have a point in this edit . 	0
However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0
