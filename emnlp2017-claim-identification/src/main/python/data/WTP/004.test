When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0

That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0

I do however believe this stuff isn ' t at all relevant to Obama ' s bio and would recommend to JahnTeller to look in the future into trying to get info on his legislative works in his Presidency of Barack Obama article instead of here . 	0
If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
I think there might be confusion here . 	0
@Eldereft . 	0
Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

The persecution of the Missouri and Illinois saints is ok , if they are referred to as " subversive " culturally , but the fact that a big part of this is that they were mostly immigrants from the North-East and other countries , the LDS church ' s teachings against slavery and their politics were Abolitionist in nature is not relevant to this article . 	0
This First Vision event was spoken of and Smith was severely persecuted for it . 	0
I question any published medical work that has not been peer reviewed , and I believe that the WP guidelines say the same thing . 	1

The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0

You also continue to be wrong and , as far as I can tell , are appealing to WP policies which do not support your position . 	0
You are being patient and nice , and I appreciate that . 	0
You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0
I know Anthrax ' s drummer said exactly what the article says about Judas Priest , and he is just one hell of a source ! 	0

It ' s irrelevant for the classification of the language . 	0
To the contrary , it ' s closer to blues than much of Sabbath ' s music , and definitely bluesier than " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
Let ' s look at the blues matter from another angle : what does Judas Priest sound like ? 	0
I ' m assuming this article credits their " discarding " of blues in their classic " British Steel " ( another weakness is this article ' s vagueness ) , which is their sixth album ? 	0
I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
It was . 	0
I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0
I recall the last time we had a debate about abortion , we passed a bill out of here . 	0
Now , as I said before , this probably won ' t make any difference . 	0
And it was a straw man ; you ' re asking me to defend a mischaracterisation of my argument ( that " he availability of the GNU userland in no way affected the popularity of Linux " : of course it did , but the two aren ' t so interlinked regarding the kernel ' s development as to warrant a large part of the intro discussing the history of GNU ) . 	0
No , this wasn ' t what was suggested at all . 	0
Now that ' s basically my position at the present time , keeping in mind that personal opinions are not what determines content here , but on talk pages we do benefit from exploring the issues involved and explaining why we do or do not support the inclusion or formatting of certain matters . 	0
" Generic " counseling and caring bedside manner seem obvious ; Freud ' s ideas , not so much so . " 	0

I am not very familiar with lists either , but you may want to look at Wikipedia : WikiProject Lists # Guidelines . 	0

Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0

Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1

Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0

According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0

The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

I have read the links you provided , but they have revealed to me nothing beyond what I already know . 	0
I think this is a fairly important point , since it has an impact on the dates we include in this article . 	1
The ZAR was subsumed into the Union of South Africa in 1910 , it did not become the Union . 	0

- Well , I can ' t speak for Wikiscient , but I assume it ' s for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly : The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image , another very specific case of death . 	0
Whether an oil-painting or the photograph of a real human skull , as suggested by Nk . sheridan above ( at the bottom of the paragraph " Lead image question again " ) , I don ' t really care . 	0
@Wingspeed : You say that " . . . for similar reasons I don ' t think the dead soldier is , either . " 	0
If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0
Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
Without the caption , especially at the low image size in the article , it ' s just a person lying on the ground , apparently badly wounded , but not necessarily dead at first glance . 	0
This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0
This inclusion criteria of this article relies on notability of the source - not relevance or influence in the real world . 	0

[ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0

Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1
As for whether that merits mention in the article , you are again trying to read into this standards that are inaccurate . 	0
Subjects receive attention in Wikipedia in proportion to the level of detail in the sources from which the article is written . " 	0
According to Wikipedia : Fringe theories , " A fringe theory can be considered notable if it has been referenced extensively , and in a serious manner , in at least one major publication , or by a notable group or individual that is independent of the theory . . . 	0
Would be good if you could say what those reasons are . 	0
But thank you for clearing it . 	0
I ' m not imagining anything being " descriptive " of abortion . 	0

Yorkshirian , correct me if I ' m wrong on any of this , but - you ' ve just returned from a long ban ? 	0
You ' ve done exactly the same ( largescale removal / replacement of text , formatting and templates ) at England , Great Britain and now Ireland ? 	0
In each case , different editors have reverted you and asked you to discuss first ? 	0
We need better sourcing . 	0
Nancy , I am not after a propaganda article , I am after an accurate article , and I think that there is no serious argument that Irenaeus faked the list of popes in his writings as of 190 AD . 	0
Therefore I don ' t think the unsupported comment by Duffy has a place in what is already a quite lengthy section . 	0
With regard to the Mexican points , these will have to be checked . 	1
The idea that before 1527 the church didn ' t agree that indians hads souls , yet converted them before this , doesn ' t stand up . 	0
Just because something has been printed somewhere doesn ' t mean that it is true . 	1
If the book is POV or the writer has only a slender grasp of relevant issues , material can be wrong . 	0
Similarly with the points relevant to indians position as " children " , this is very vague and gives no law , date or time that can be pinpointed . 	0
The idea that Xavier only preached among Thomas christians is simply wrong . 	0
See Israel-United_States_military_relations # Military_aid . 	0
I went through and removed ones that seemed obviously unnecessary , and left a few in without checking them thoroughly . 	0
Feel free to remove existing links , too . 	0
Also also , I don ' t think the most touchy person becomes the arbiter of content . 	0
I ' m looking for a replacement . 	0
I notice that one of our iconic Santa images got deleted . 	0
If a company makes sprockets , it doesn ' t need to be recognized as a sprocket company by any government in order for an encyclopedia to say that it makes sprockets . 	0
Hamas habitually engages in terrorist activites , as explicitly noted by the entries in both the Britannica and Encarta encyclopedias , which are linked to from the article . 	1
Sure , it would be plagiarism , but it would make a better article and allow many of us to avoid spending our precious time on this earth in Wikipedia battles . 	0
It would be nice if we could just copy the article on Hamas from a real encyclopedia and paste it here . 	1
I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0
Please show me where I have an ad hominem argument in support of my position . 	0

WHAT DOES GAP STAND FOR ? ? ? 	0
One wonders , was there a right answer ? 	0
I realize I ' m acting a bit edgy , but then so too would most people , I ' m sure , who ' d just provided 50 sources on controversial material being excluded from an article , only to be told they hadn ' t made any points . 	0
And had I provided no sources , I ' d have doubtless been accused of not providing sources . 	0
I provided too many sources , and got accused of making ' walls of text ' . 	0
Instead of answers , there are inflammatory remarks followed by edit war attempts to prevent said remarks from being removed , and vandalism attacks on the page . 	0
It seems , no matter how much sourcing or facts I provide , I cannot generate any response from critics other than personal attacks about racism or Wikipedia history . 	1

The original edit was far from POV and completely unnecessary . 	0
That is where my disagreement is based from . 	0
Again , I ' m not disputing that the term exists and is frequently thrown around in left-leaning / arabist news agencies , but drawing parallels to the settlement / disputed / occupied territories whatever was simply false . 	0
IOF is essentially name-calling in comparison . 	0
Some commentators insist these sorts of words are part of a general effort to reframe the reality of the Israel-Palestinian conflict . 	0

Here ' s irony for you : Abner Cole , self proclaimed Mormon hater , wishes to discredit Smith ' s claim . 	0
The newspaper evidence which , like I explained before , is relevant when both articles are taken together . 	0
It seems like you have been targeting each of my edits and have methodically set about undoing them . 	0
Your previous statement along with a long string of undo ' s of my edits led me to believe that you were opposed to more detail . 	0
A century and a few decades later , the article about Cole , when combined with the other article supporting Smith ' s claim to have seen heavenly visions , his Anti-Mormon voice provides credibility to the idea that Smith told people about his vision before the Church was established in 1830 . 	0
I was thinking that this background around BSD and Hurd is not mentioned in History of the Linux kernel , so it would perhaps better to put that detail in there instead of mentioning it here - - 	0
He just wanted the Shah out . " . 	0
These credible sources cannot simply be pulled out my ass 	0
Additional interpretation from the guardian link above : " The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah ' s regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel . 	0
Please also remember that the current paragraph is wikilinked to an extensive Wikipedia article devoted to the subject of preist sex abuse . 	0
Neither of those are appropriate without a source indicating that some nationality is important in the invention of relativity . 	0
No , we shouldn ' t . 	0
Relevant cited text can be included in the article , of course , subject to consensus . 	0
Even then it ' s bound to be controversial , so the category should be left out . 	1
Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1

Important to acknowledge is the metal genre ' s norms , many of which were created by Sabbath . 	0
Less focus on magazine lists ! 	0
This is a serious encyclopedia ! 	0
They practically single-handedly created this genre , light-years away from Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple , playing slow and detuned , discarding the blues-influence before Judas Priest ( Master of Reality , Sabbath Bloody Sabbath , Vol 4 ) . 	0
They should get their own paragraph in the very beginning . 	1
This article will never be good or accurate as long as it has one fundamental error : Black Sabbath . 	0

Glyn_Moody ' s book ' Rebel Code : Linux and the Open Source Revolution ' which covers the birth of the Linux kernel amongst other things . 	0
The book talks about 386BSD in quite a bit of detail and the fact that Linus was aware of it at the time on p65-67 and Linus is quoted as saying " if 386BSD come out a year earlier , I probably wouldn ' t have started Linux " . 	0
Hurd is barely mentioned except to quote one of Linus ' s initial usenet postings on p45 [ 4 ] . 	0
As to taking it out all together and placing it in First Vision wiki article remember : King George , The British Empire . 	0
As you wish , It might be useful though to make some modifications to the article so that you and I are happy with it first . 	0
I will leave it alone for a while and observe . 	0
There ' s nothing democratic about a nation where the ruling party came to power via fraud and keeps power the same way . 	0
It is obscene to classify South Africa as a ' liberal democracy ' when their leader is a lifelong member of the communist party and frequently talks about the people , the masses , peoples liberation , etc . Furthermore F . W . De Klerk himself even came out and said the 1994 election was rife with fraud . 	1
With a lifelong member of the South African communist party in power , and communisty party officials frequently invited to attend national conferences and speak at public events , it seems that South Africa ' s government is increasingly taking on a communist appearance . 	0
South Africa ' s government is no different than that of Zimbabwe , a de facto one party state by virtue of fraud , lies , violence , and corruption . 	0

I don ' t know if they ' re moving towards a centrally planned economy but classifying South Africa as a communist country instead of a liberal democracy is more appropriate , at least it deserves consideration . 	0
Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0
The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
