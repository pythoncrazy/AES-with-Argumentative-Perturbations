It seems to me if we are reporting what Smith said , Smith ' s own writings are probably the best possible source . 	0
" . . . considering Smiths own writings it is not more accurate " Why do you say that ? 	0
He doesn ' t mention considering non-Christian faiths , so it seems natural to state that he was trying to decide which Christian church to join . " 	0
Smith said he was trying to decide between the different " sects " , and he mentions the Methodists , the Presbyterians , and so forth . 	0

There seems to be no disagreement that there was a division of some sort under the 1920 act . 	0

Nu metal is just an umbrella term used to describe all metal bands that add elements of alternative or rap music to their music . 	0
Saying System of a Down is alternative metal and not nu metal is like saying Limp Bizkit is rap metal instead of nu metal . 	0

I view Smith ' s 1838 personal history as a good source for explaining what he said happened to him . ) 	0

What I have opposed is the addition of details about how newspapers in the early 1830s were mocking Smith for having claimed to have seen God . 	0
That ' s unneeded detail , and I thought it was what we were talking about all along . 	0
Where did I say the detail of who Smith saw are too specific ? 	0
I ' ve never disputed that . 	1
So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0
I don ' t understand why you believe it ' s not relevant . 	0
It shows the nature of IDF operations in the occupied territories , its cooperation with settler groups . 	0

Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

The Citizens Commission on Human Rights fails as a RS for this matter , as it is a Scientology front group , IOW a pseudoskeptical group pushing pseudoscientific ideas . 	1
The very essence of what is involved in the proper understanding of pseudoscience and skepticism are being violated here . 	0
When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0
If they have any legitimate criticisms , then it should be possible to find them in mainstream sources , not fringe sources . 	0

Specifically , I was reprimanding Somnobot ' s " quit whining " comment , which was patently uncivil , and Talv ' s " I can tell you have an agenda you ' re attempting to push " comment , which I found mildly , but inappropriately , accusatory in nature ( see WP : AGF ) . 	0

Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
Yes , of course it should . 	0
That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0

However , while the worst MSNBC have done is lean to the left , FOX has a history of failing to do basic fact checking : before Sanford , they called Specter , Foley , and even McCain Democrats on one occasion or another . 	0

Presumably it descends from a non-IE language that was spoken in the Pyrenees region before the arrival of Indo-European speakers , and is in that sense " pre-Indo-European " ; some scholarly references call Basque a " pre-Indo-European " language in this way . 	0
But others simply use " non-Indo-European " , which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn ' t changed since primeval times ; so I ' d prefer to use " non-Indo-European " rather than " pre-Indo-European " . 	0
Should mention of Vatican II be in the lead ? 	0

If you want to argue otherwise , you need to produce reliable secondary sources , because the article lays it out with such sources . 	0
It ' s almost meaningless from a scholary standpoint . 	0
In contrast , the body of the article emphasizes that the genre evolved directly from blues rock and psychedelia . 	0
By the way , there ' s an incline citation in the article at the point where it says metal and hard rock were synonymous . 	0

Define hard rock artists first of all . 	0
It ' s really difficult to . 	0
" Hard rock " is too vague to really be useful as a genre term , while heavy metal is very well-defined . 	0

If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
I think there might be confusion here . 	0
@Eldereft . 	0
Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

There was a " falling away " as 2Thesselonians spoke of and a " Restoration " with the story of the First Vision . 	0

Lastly , Northern Ireland had a flag of its own but I don ' t see it shown here . 	0
The UK is a sovereign state , which governs part of the island of Ireland , the EU is not a sovereign state , nor does it govern part of the island of Ireland , that ' s why the UK ' s flag is important and the EU ' s flag is not . 	1
User : MusicInTheHouse you stated the flag makes no benefit to the article . 	0
Some points I ' d like to make . 	0
Secondly , you stated the flag isn ' t mentioned in the section . 	0
In what way does the Irish Tri-Colour make any benefit to the article any more than the UK flag would ? 	0
Thirdly , you say the flag represents something which has nothing to do with the island of Ireland . 	0
Nor is the Irish Tri-Colour , at all . 	0
Fourthly , you make comparison between the UK and EU . 	0
Last I looked the flag represents something which has something to do with the north east section of the island of Ireland . 	0

Well to me , as an old fart , this multiplicity of sub-sub-sub-genres is both divisive and unnecessary , since these terms seem to be created either by rock journalists , whom Frank Zappa once described as " people , who can ' t write , interviewing people , who can ' t talk , for people , who can ' t read .

If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0

For reference , my input is that she be listed R&B , reggae , pop , rock . 	0
After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0

Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0

The most ghits seem to be found supporting that Rihanna is R&B , then pop , and I only found that allmusic source supporting reggae . 	0

Very few references can be found to support that Rihanna is a reggae singer , all I managed to find was her allmusic page which lists reggae after pop , and lists both as styles under the main genre R&B . 	1
This is a new discussion , to gain new consensus . 	0

The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0
wasn ' t this a big deal when the elections were going on ? 	0

I believe Hamas actions have NEVER been more " terroristic " than ANY other group involved in the war . . . . . israeli or Palestinian groups â€¦ â€¦ and therefore , I am simply advocating for FAIR AND BALANCED behavior and descriptions of ALL parties involved . 	0
If you wish to see proof of the extent of all parties " terrorism " actions / consequences , check the statistics section on this website . . . http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp â€¦ . 	0
Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0

" Pro-life " actually does apply directly to contraception , from a Catholic understanding , because of both " emergency contraception " ( which many argue is abortion ) and the belief that any artificial contraception denies the potential for life . 	1

I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U .

@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0

Could you please explain your reasoning that logically leads you to make this claim ? 	0
I agree , what happened to mentioning those three topics ? 	0

The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
The article that focusses on his presidency will have a much more narrow focus and will include much of what I am assuming you wish to see in his bio . 	0

In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0

It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0
The " Old Catholic Church " is known as just that - although it is not very old . 	0
While " Roman Catholic Church " may be acceptable for an article title to avoid confusion . 	0

Purple never were heavy metal album-wise before Sabbath , though , they were hard rock through and through . 	0
Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0

You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0

So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0
In my view , changing from ' sect ' to ' church ' is a POV push . 	0

I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
It was . 	0
I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0

Contentious misunderstandings â€” say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings â€” is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0

On average , the temperature of the earth is not increasing , and that ' s a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space ( as radiation at longer wave-lengths ) . 	1
( Wind is coming from the fact that the suns shines on different parts of the earth unevenly , etc . . . ) 	0
The temperature of a planet is roughly determined by equating its blackbody radiation output with how much it absorbs by the sun . 	0
If it absorbed more than it emitted , its temperature would increase â€¦ 	0

You argue that two Boston based groups , one of which claims to be Catholic are proof that even more of the world wide Catholic Church article needs to be centered on the US sex abuse scandal . 	0
There are hundreds of disaffected catholic and crypto-catholic groups with websites , ranging from pro-abortionists to groups that think the Pope is Protestant ! 	0
I think we merely need to find specific objective criteria that we can agree on . 	0

Lapsed Pacifist in his edit implied that all Israeli weapons were made with " generous US support " , which is both original research and inappropriate synthesis . 	0
The debate about how much aid the US really gives Israel is quite fascinating , but not relevant to the edit in question . 	0
Are you equally astute in following up cild abuse issues in the Anglican Church articles , or those about the Baptist Church , or UK Social Services ? 	0
Trawling up odd snippets about the Bishop of Yakima hiring a man " under investigation " for viewing pornography as a student ( and who was then dismissed from the seminary ) does not make it a world-shattering event - or show that the Catholic Church is uniquely evil - as seems to be an underlying theme here . 	0

The very least we can do is match accurate quotes to the actual sources that support those quotes . 	1
What is sad about all this is that when I looked at the refs being used , none of them supported the precise wording used in quotations in this article . 	0

In fact , we are obliged to do that by WP : BLP . 	0
Different people will look at the same quote and they will link it in different ways . 	0

On a side note , I see there is a small incomplete chart of Israel military casualties here , I would like to see a full article devoted to Israel ' s casualties like this one : United States casualties of war . 	0
Countries with much more " colorful " military history such as the United States armed forces , French Armed Forces , British Armed Forces , and Indian Armed Forces have no similar controversy section . 	0
For starters , it looks very misplaced . 	0
However I must take issue with the controversy controversy section . 	0
I ' ve been reviewing the article and for the most part it ' s pretty solid . 	0
To be perfectly honest I think those 3 articles could be easily moved into a single article , and any left pertinent information could be moved here . 	0
I propose we move the controversy section to Military history of Israel , History of the Israel Defense Forces , or Israeli wars and armed conflict . 	0
Why is the IDF article any different ? 	0
There is certainly more than enough reliable sources to support one , so the absence is telling . 	0

I don ' t feel that reggae should be listed before pop as the latter is more prevalent in the artist ' s music . 	1
Starting this discussion because a user was not happy with the genres being listed as " R&B , pop , reggae " instead of " R&B , reggae , pop " and an edit war over such an arrangement would be silly . 	0
R&B and pop have been the artist ' s main genres since her second album and influences were also present on her first . 	0
Reggae was prevalent on the artist ' s first album and partially on her second ; from 2008 to present , only influences have been present . 	0
How do other editors feel about this proposal ? 	0
The artist is more known for her contributions to those two genres than to reggae , which is why they should be listed first . 	0

Yes , because they are very-well known and have sold many albums ; but more importantly because the bulk of their music itself is in majority straight in line with heavy metal music tradition . 	0

That ' s not the issue here . 	0
I can place a bet that any book about heavy metal history that ' s worth its money mentions Judas Priest somewhere in there . 	1
Many early Rock n Rollers were influenced by delta blues artist Robert Johnson ; that doesn ' t make Johnson ' s music become Rock n Roll . 	0
Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

Okay , I ' ve made some minor cleanups and corrections . 	0
Please note that the article does not in any way assign blame to BP , something that is beyond the scope here . 	0
Instead it correctly notes that BP is the well operator , lead the cleanup / containment effort so far , and bore the brunt of the public cry for Obama to do something . 	0

The issue of whether or not a comma would be required in this instance is one of grammar and not one of personal whim . 	0
Mk5384 , you have expressed your justification for the comma , and others have explained the context in which a comma would be appropriate and the grammatical reason for why a comma where you have suggested one would require a second comma . 	0
The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1
Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives , as in changing " he is a tall and thin man " to " he is a tall , thin man " . 	0
( Such is apparent from the comment about the Bush article . ) 	0
Similarly , constancy is not a basis upon which to determine punctuation . 	1
I think it is OR to assume that the archaic slang was abandoned because of the sexual slang . 	0

We ought to use the correct rather than colloquial name . 	0
Okay , we can clean up a few things . 	0
One way or another we need to keep this section manageable , and the most obvious solution is to chop off stuff of tangential relevance . 	0
The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event , but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened , when , whose fault it was , and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama , not BP and its tribulations . 	0

So was the IDF known as the " IOF " because the " occupation " began between 1948-1967 ? 	0
The " IOF " , IMO ( obviously ) is simply another buzzword designed to villify and demonize the Israeli army . 	0

So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
Now where does the " grey " come in ? 	0
Does that make sense ? 	0
If you want add links for other large scale operations , then that would also be relevant for the lead ( and improve the article without using up any more than a few additional words ) . 	0

The number of casualties is one of the best measures for judging the scale of a war ( since statistics like this are more objective and verifiable than questions of " historical significance " ect ) . 	1
The fact that , as you say , it ' s been re-added about 50 times , shows that the wikipedia consensus is that it stay . 	0
As to whether or not it should count as a war , then that is surely just a matter of semantics - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarFinally I agree this info should also be added to the main history article as well . 	0

Contrast with human infections by SARS or filoviruses , which do kill the host rapidly and epidemics extinguish quickly . 	0
Even as pathogenic as HIV is , it won ' t " burn out " anytime soon ( by killing all its hosts ) , because people have plenty of time to transmit before dying . 	1
It is now a naturally-occurring infection of humans ( transmitted in communities and not laboratory-engineered ) , but it may evolve further to the less pathogenic ( like its parent virus SIV is in the respective natural hosts ) . 	0

To truly be labelled a pseudoscience , as per WP : PSCI , the topic must be an Obvious pseudoscience or Generally considered pseudoscience . 	0
While some of the entries on this list are definitive pseudosciences , some of the entries are not . 	0

I am going to tag this entire article with POV issues tag . 	0
Currently , this article violates this fundemental principle of Wikipedia because it is purposefully excluding certain significant views on what characterizes a pseudoscience . 	1

I don ' t really love that we are sidestepping aroung a piece of WP : NPOV , but that is what we are working with at the moment . 	0

Obviously , Obama has received criticism for a number of his policies and activities in the last year , especially his push for health care legislation , his continuation of Bush ' s foreign policy , evinced by his decision to send additional troops into the field , and his unwillingness to close Gitmo , another Bush policy he ' s left unchanged . 	0
Those are major issues , and criticism of his positions on those issues is notable . 	0

Now , logical assessment will lead you to conclude that this is just semantics and that countries committing the same acts as " terrorists " would also fall into the category of " terrorism " . . . . . . . . it ' s just that the U .

On the other hand , you might be able to say something like : " The earth is a planet containing continents , oceans , and islands , and is the only known source of life in the universe . 	0

As to citing a gateway site , that ' s problematic . 	1
According to Professor Bob Jones at the Creation Science Institute of Arkansas , the earth is a " flat , four-cornered surface resting on the backs of turtles " . " This , of course , would have WP : UNDUE and WP : FRINGE problems , which is another matter . 	0

So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0
Martin gets off very lightly . 	0

In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1
Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article ? 	0
Also think about this from a political view - Chinese people may be highly offended by the image . 	0

How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . â€¦ â€¦ 	1

That other view must be in this article for it to be NPOV . 	0

When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0

It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0

That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0

A bias to hide relevant information is sinister - and what wikipedia is NOT all about . 	0
The strong desire to keep images of what an abortion is hidden speaks volumes about those who possess it . 	0
The strong desire to make such images available to more people ( rather than suppressed ) is to be lauded by all who favor enlightenment and decision-making based on fully informed decision-makers . 	0
Abortion is a common surgery . 	0

I for one do not think that the controversy / criticism section needs to be any bigger than any one of the history , structure or equipment sections . 	1
There are also multiple organizations , notably Breaking the Silence , that deal specifically with this issue ( see above discussion with Deborahjay ) , and there is a main article for the recent controversy . 	0
If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1
If you ' re suggesting that the tone of the current article is fear-mongering , then I disagree . 	0

Ditto . 	0
A MVA Manual_vacuum_aspiration , with WHO ( anybody know their copyright status ? ) pictures at [ [ 9 ] ] , makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple , and not even that interestingly graphic . 	0
Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
There has been an attempt to build consensus for what are reasonable deviations from the US place name guideline . 	0
But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0
No longer are we just relying on highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science , but rather we are open to including skeptic groups , notable academics and researchers , etc . So now we are not definitively labelling anything pseudoscience . 	0
Am I an editor refusing to allow " any mention " of it in the article ? 	1
No . 	1
Wassap , I don ' t see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short . 	1
The three reasons for keeping the sex abuse section short are : it has its own article , and to make it longer violates WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0

Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1

Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : â€” 	0

At the same time , our enthusiasm for this report must be tempered by a realistic view of both the history of sensational announcements in HIV research and our goals at Wikipedia . 	1
From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1

And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0

No , it seem you be confused here . 	1
That said , I suppose since it ' s more about the charges against him , all that is mentioned there is more suitable for his article . 	0
Not to mention . . . it ' s probably best not to duplicate that same exact information in both articles when there is no additional information in one of them to differentiate each other . 	0
I point to well-sourced articles such as Heath Ledger and well-sourced / Featured Articles such as Angelina Jolie . 	0
As much as Jolie is famous for her career , she is also well-known for her personal life . 	0
I disagree that " Personal life sections tend to give WP : UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual ' s WP : NOTABILITY . " 	0
While no one , except mostly reality show stars , become famous / notable for their personal lives , I do not believe that it ' s trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia . 	1
But , really , I do not see the Personal life sections as that different than the Early life sections , except for the fact that the Early life sections deal with a person ' s early personal life . . . while the other deals with the person ' s later personal life . 	0
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about " the incident " pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section . 	0
The same goes for Michael Jackson . 	0
Notice , though , that the sections about Jolie ' s personal life are not under a main section titled Personal life . 	0

However , I would like to float a compromise addition to the Denialism section , which carefully contrasts skepticism ( Root-Bernstein ) and denialism ( Duesberg ) , drawing on Lederer ' s nuanced article that explores diverse viewpoints and explains how denialism has lost steam in light of newer research and treatments . 	1
Lederer ' s 2006 article is cited on the AIDS Denialism page . 	0
When I say " float " , I mean a heart-felt request that all editors who are so dedicated to keeping this page clear will allow 24 hours for everyone to view my changes before reverting . 	0
Can we all agree to breathe deep and keep calm that long ? 	0
That might attract some new voices to the discussion , people who might never see my changes if they are reverted in less than two hours . 	0

Therefore , to say that the research was confirmed , is rather incorrect . 	1
Yes , HIV can be made by the " bucketful " . 	1
Reverse transcriptase activity is shown to occur , and so it is assumed that the DNA that is found must be viral . 	1

It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0

BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0

if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0

No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

The definition of holocaust denial ( according to wikipedia ) is : " Holocaust denial consists of claims that the genocide of Jews during World War II â€” usually referred to as the Holocaust [ 1 ] â€” did not occur at all , or that it did not happen in the manner or to the extent historically recognized . " no " claims " are being made , so it cannot be classified as a holocaust denial , especially given that he specifically addressed that in numerous occasions to clear that he is NOT denying the holocaust . 	0

There is , in fact , a photograph of the body of a woman who died of an illegal abortion which is occasionally trotted out in pro-choice literature , so it ' s not as though we ' re only discussing the exclusion of the aborted fetus pictures used in pro-life activism â€” the rule works both ways . 	0
Also , photographs of an abortion procedure , as described by Ackoz , would be so ambiguous as to be suggestive of almost any other gynecological procedure . 	0

I ' m not up to it tonight , but perhaps by reiterating that " first lady " has the split meanings of presidential spouse / social hostess , it could be stated more clearly . 	0
P . S . - Follow-up note : I agree that the " female president " section could be made clearer . 	0
Karanacs , surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven ' t previously been involved in editing an article ? 	0
It doesn ' t read well as it is . 	0
Presumably a female President would still be the hostess , but it seems ridiculous to suggest the President could also be the First Lady at the same time ( unless the US has a lesbian President , and let ' s not go there . . . ) 	0
I think people are correct in saying there needs to be a distinction between the spouse of the President and the hostess at the White House . 	0
I added a line about how this was resolved in a fictitious situation : President Mackenzie Allen ' s husband is titled First Gentleman but her mother eventually joins the white house as a de facto hostess . 	0
But I don ' t see why a First Gentleman couldn ' t perform all the functions of a ' hostess ' , if he was minded to do so . 	0
But here is the second , and very key , point to address - who would be the " hostess of the white house " ? 	0
By definition , the husband cannot be the hostess , so who would be ? 	0
It is all speculation , and it will probably be decided by the mainstream press as much as by the officeholder himself . 	0
" First Gentleman " seems to be the most likely candidate . 	0
Remember ; first lady has two meanings , " spouse of the president " and " hostess of the whitehouse " . 	0
So , in the case of a female president , what would we call her spouse ? 	0
I ' ve just tried putting some compromise language in that addresses both points . 	0

These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0

A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
Where and when ? 	0
" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

" Mythical " is a compromise , but I think it ' s a fairly accurate one , in that there are without question many myths involving Santa Claus . 	1
Everything printed , filmed , spoken , or otherwise told about him cannot be true . 	0
Look at the movie " Ernest Saves Christmas " for instance . 	0
It is fiction , but it has added * stuff * to the myths surrounding Santa Claus ( the sleigh that only works if people believe in Santa Claus , for instance ) . 	0
When I first looked at the article last year , it blatantly said Santa Claus is " fictional " . 	0
As I personally believe that Santa Claus is real , I took exception , and there was quite a heated little discussion on the matter . 	0

Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0

The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam . 	0
Apples and oranges aside , this appears to be how the Vatican views the landscape , and as such , this event constitutes a tremendous psychological milestone from both the Muslim and the Roman Catholic point-of-view . 	0
This is how I read this story , and from that reading this certainly appears big enough for an In The News feature . 	0

The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1

This is the sort of discussion that is important to have with members of the wiki editorial group . 	0
They are criticism , not research . 	0
Reviews aren ' t the same as histories or biographies ; they are critical commentary / opinion , and do not have authoritative weight on the histories and biogrpahies cover , because that ' s not what they are intended to cover . 	1
So far I only see one source that would classify as such , that being this . 	0
What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
Now , as for sources . 	0
Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

As you are no doubt well aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	0
The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1

I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church â€¦ " . 	1

A peer reviewer has made two suggestions for improvement to the article that would be significant changes . 	0
Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

I ' ve seen multiple ' reliable ' sources show different views on what constitutes metal , as well . 	0
I ' ve never seen what makes ' hard rock ' debated , except in the context of whether a song or band is ' metal ' or ' hard rock ' during metal discussions . 	0
I agree that the Catholic Church did a lot more good than bad ( and still does ) . 	0
I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0

The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
Yet present wording does mention the major events and provides wikilinks that Karanacs version would eliminate . 	0
Responding to Karanacs : The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth ' s actions - it treats them equally - NPOV . 	0
No offense , it is just my honest opinion . 	0
I think present wording is more valuable and factually accurate that what Karanacs has proposed . 	1

Interesting interpretations of the Anglo-Irish treaty aside , the Free State never had control over Northern Ireland . 	0

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding regarding the role of the UGLE and the Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon , which I attempted to clear up with my various edits . 	0
The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1
Judas Priests contributions are not sourced either , so why should they have the right to be up there unsourced ? 	0

In truth , the LAShTAL . com resources are significantly more extensive and comprehensive than the existing Wikipedia article . 	0
I would posit that much of the information contained in the Wikipedia article is sourced from the research and effort of the LAShTAL . com membership . 	0

The LAShTAL . com site is the home of the Aleister Crowley Society . 	0
Based on a review of the LAShTAL . com site and WP : ELNO , I agree with Acsociety ' s assessment that the Aleister Crowley article ahould reference the LAShTAL . com site . 	1
The LAShTAL . com resources are much more than collection links to existing work - they comprise the most accurate , scholarly analysis of the man and his works in any format . 	0
As such , it is the recognized comprehensive authority on the life and works of Crowley and the repository of much original work on the topic . 	0

As for the military suicide picture , we already have two black and white WWII images of dead people , so I think something a bit different would be preferable . 	1
A picture of an electric chair would be more appropriate , or if we must continue to shock the reader , a person that has been hung with flies hovering over their corpse . 	0
And as we ' ve said , this isn ' t capital punishment but a wartime mass execution of the perceived enemy . 	0
There are already 2 others , and there was a third in the martyrdom section , which was again irrelevant . 	0
The argument , as we ' ve made , is that there are already more than enough war pictures - there is more to death than images of people being shot dead in a war . 	1

Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U .

If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . . " statement to a more appropriate section in the article and don ' t get any opposition from you , then it would be more in line with the method used on the " israel " wiki page . 	0
I even like the wording used right now . . . . . . but . . . . in comparing it to the " israel " wiki page , it just makes sense to have it positioned in a different area . . . . . will you oppose this ? 	0
I don ' t feel it should be removed , quite the contrary , there is quite the evidence and references that this is a common view held by international politics about Hamas , and therefore should be included in the " Hamas " page . . . . 	0

The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0

( edit conflict ) As noted in my edit summary , this article is about the life and career of Barack Obama . 	0
It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0
This page is pretty ridiculous now . 	0

The second set of statements , if they belong anywhere , would make most sense in an article on LBGT politics or sociology . 	0

No one will argue with the fact that SF is known for its large LBGT population . 	0

On the Origins / Mission section , I am not fanatical either way . 	0
Most people reading the article will not be familiar with the creed , and it is so important , it deserves being there in full . 	0
My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0
Is the section really a problem as is ? 	0
Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0
or we could trim the Origins and Mission section by more than half , turning it into an introductory paragraph to the main article , again with any important detail transferred to " history . " 	0
I agree that the article needs more on the Church throughout the world , but in a much broader way than has been proposed here - mission work , for example . 	1

Isn ' t the material more appropriate for First Vision , though ? 	0
This article is not about the First Vision , it is a broad article about Mormonism in general . 	0
I don ' t see the rationale of including this information in this article . 	0
It also sounds like you are out to " prove " something is the case . 	1
The visits of the angel Moroni to Smith were emphasized by the early church much more than the First Vision , but the details of those visitations are not set out in this article â€” they are reserved for articles like Angel Moroni . 	0
To me it sounds like you are giving undue weight to the event which actually was not given a great amount of weight at the time . 	0
Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account â€” other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

While I think that much of the POV issues raised recently are overblown , there are subtle things which can be done to improve NPOV . 	1

By keeping together content when it is intellectually coherent to do so ( as Karanacs alludes to ) , the tone becomes more descriptive , what IMO such an article should strive to be . 	0

[ 38 ] } } Ironically , Obama is asking Americans to place their trust in the abortion doctors making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in potentially harming other human beings , when it is not in their best interests to even reveal that children are surviving their abortions , let alone care for those children , as it could endanger their industry and cause unnecessary expense . 	0
The bill ' s purpose was reasonable , to ensure at least 2 physicians were accountable for verifying live-born children were not in fact surviving the abortions , to prevent the same " infanticide " that led Congress to declare partial birth abortion illegal . 	0

There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0

I DID NOT " twist your words " . 	1
You claimed that U . S . / israeli actions are " military " whereas Hamas ' actions are " targeting civilians " . . . . . . and now are citing the Geneva Conventions â€¦ . ok â€¦ . 	0
Please . . . . . . when you DO make this argument . . . . . . . . remember to include all of the evidence that israeli " military action " has been successful in advancing israel ' s war against the Palestinians / Lebonese ( gaining military advantages anticipated ) . 	0
Here ' s MY evidence that this is NOT true : http://a.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=6760726&pid=76 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-attacks-signal-failure-of-military-offensive-652232.html http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244139,00.html http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article692233.ece 4 . 	1
. . . so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U . S . / israeli actions are " necessary " and achieve a ( relatively ) successful military goal and that , in turn , justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention . 	0

I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0

It ' s ofcourse not necessary to have a gallery as it says " The gallery tag is not a tool to shoehorn images into an article , and a gallery consisting of an indiscriminate collection of images of the article subject should generally either be improved in accordance with the above paragraph or moved to Wikimedia Commons . " 	1
This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0

OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0
However , given that I am hearing one " doesn ' t matter " and one ( apparently ) " no keep as is " , I am glad I brought it up first , and any further input welcome and indeed desired . 	0
Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1
Well , that might sounds a little pov as it might be different to everyone . 	0

It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0

Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1
Glad everyone got back on track here . 	0

How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

yeah , sorry my reply was to him , not to you , i ' ve tabbed correctly now Haaretz is definitely reputable as a source to use on Wikipedia . 	0
So that fact cannot be argued to be included in the leading / initial description of the " Hamas " wiki page . 	0
I appreciate you pointing out that you agree with that , and hope that you understand it was NOT my intention to imply that because of their status today , Hamas ' previous ( or present ) actions are to be define in a different way . 	0

if you don ' t accept THAT proof . . . . . there ' s always the declaration on Nov . 15 1988 - http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27a/099.html . . . . . 	0
This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0
Now , I realize we are talking about a global situation , and not just one that relates to the U . S . . 	0
Would it not seem logical , then , to specifically state that the designation / label / view of Hamas is a matter of debate / discussion / confussion within international community standards ? 	1
Their existence as the governing body of the Palestinian state / country / territories is NOT a matter of debate / discussion / confussion . 	1

For example , with all due respect to the Battle of Ammunition Hill , likely more significant in the long term than the Liberty incident , it simply did not impact the IDF in a major way to be included here . 	0

Things in the UK certainly haven ' t got to quite the level that they have in the States , with Dioceses going into bankruptcy , but I really don ' t think you can that there is no problem with how the issue has been dealt with . 	1
As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0

It ' s true that it isn ' t a legal or national title ( although who knows , maybe its usage is mandated by certain sources in their official communications , I don ' t know ) but its presence in RS does indicate that it is some kind of alternate name ( and its validity doesn ' t come into it ) . 	0

The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1

Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

Until and unless one of the abovementioned things , or some other major detail , arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end , I really don ' t see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers . 	0
It doesn ' t have to be a response section but some words under the environmental section , etc . - - 	0
Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his " presidential hip " . 	0
It ' s the largest oil spill in U . S . history , that ' s not minor . 	0
Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
Do not use inflammatory language against another editor . 	0
I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0
The date of the creation of the administrative subdivisions is not really that relevant . 	0

- Well , I can ' t speak for Wikiscient , but I assume it ' s for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly : The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image , another very specific case of death . 	0
Let ' s toss those non-biologists then ! 	0
We need a new section soon , this is getting lengthy . 	1
Whether an oil-painting or the photograph of a real human skull , as suggested by Nk . sheridan above ( at the bottom of the paragraph " Lead image question again " ) , I don ' t really care . 	0

The same applies to the Inquisition figure . 	0
If you say 3-4 , 000 were probaby executed - when ? 	0
The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context . 	1
Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1
If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0

Nope , I believe the Soviet Union was really communist . 	0

If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0
In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0
The result will be an article that will educate a much wider circle of readers , and more effectively . 	0

This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0
Scientology ' s point of view here may not be reliable , but it is undeniably notable . 	0

This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0

It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1

nor did i bring up the issue where the IDF is stationed mostly , this is irrelevant , there is a significant portion of the media world wide that uses that term , regarding being undue , well , the occupation of westbank , gaza strip and golan was performed by and only by the IDF , currently it is the only occupying army in the context of the Palestinian israili conflict ! 	0
well , i never said anything about renaming the article Â  ! ! 	0
this is all irrelevent , BUT sources such as aljazeera . net [ 5 ] , the palestinian center for human rights [ 6 ] , and reliefweb [ 7 ] are examples of sources which do use the term IOF instead of IDF . 	0
it is and has been ( i . e . the occupation ) a hot topic in the news for the last 42 + years ! ! 	0
the claim that the reason it is used is to demonize the israeli army or not is also irrelevant to this discussion . 	0
The Congregation first recalled the 25 January 1974 declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that " there is no doubt whatsoever " regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using " for all " as a translation of " pro multis " , since " for all " corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ ' s intention expressed in the words of the consecration , and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all ( cf . John 11 : 52 , 2 Â  Corinthians 5 : 14-15 , Titus 2 : 11 , 1 Â  John 2 : 2 ) . 	0

Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0
And the whole passage strongly implies that corruption was throughly endemic within the Church , when research shows that most parishes operated normally , donations , pilgrimages and church-building continued at their former levels . 	0

It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
So the question is , surely , whether NI remained in the UKGBI in 1922 . 	0
Northern Ireland was in the UKGBI between 1922 til 1927 when UK was renamed as UKGBNI . 	0
It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1

Smith , according to his own account , told local clergy about the First Vision and was mocked and scorned over the pulpit in his own community shortly after it had happened . 	1
If his own accounts are not enough , his mother ' s journal , as well as other sources including local newspapers all support this idea . 	0
I still believe that the newspaper articles are appropriate to the discussion specifically because they challenge certain preconceived notions about pre-1900 Mormonism . 	1
Dismissing one academic because one has supposedly taken a class and considers him to be less " mainstream " than the current thought does not change his academic credentials . 	0

This was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led some to accuse him of anti-Semitism .

In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0
also , false is a needless judgement when the facts of the matter are a click away . 	1

Since the dispute over the LEAD and inclusion criteria is now a moot point ( yes , it has been discussed to death and Levine2112 ' s comments aren ' t making sense ) , only maintained by Levine2112 ' s wikilawyering , moving on to the tag is the logical next step . 	1

A lot of these celebrities are also well-known for their romantic relationships , such as Brad Pitt and Jolie . 	0
I do not feel that having a section about that , as long as it ' s well-sourced and well-worded ( and appropriate ) , is unencyclopedic . 	0
I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0
I get your point somewhat . 	0
But to say that Personal life sections ( which by the way , do not have to be titled Personal life , as noted with the Angelina Jolie article ) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with . 	0

However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail â€¦ but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0
You are very confused about evolution . 	0
Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity . 	0

The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1

Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

It may be true or not , I choose to believe it another day when I see it myself , but I am more familiar with Sabbath ' s influences , and I ' ve seen Ozzy on interview saying that " there was no such thing as heavy metal back then " ; it was on a heavy metal documentary called " From Black Sabbath to System of a Down " , outlining a timeline for heavy metal . 	0
It was quite MTV-flashy , but surprisingly accurate , and it mentioned how Black Sabbath were set aside bands like Zeppelin and Purple because of their very different style , and stressed their sole importance . 	0

It is a violation of WP : SYNTH , as well as a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well . 	0
I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

I know this section is about defining " terrorist tactics " â€¦ â€¦ . . 	0
you obviously would like to use " international political definitions " when it suits your position ( as you just stated ) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted ( as stated above with the U . N . report ) â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ . would you like to attempt to approach my argument of having Hamas ' democratically elected status recognized on the wiki page in the first paragraph ? . . . . . . . like I said before , I ' m not trying to remove the " terrorist comment " . . . . . . . . . that ' s the whole point of wiki . . . . . . . . . but can you please explain why your are atttempting to prevent their legal status as a governing body from being stated in the initial description of the organization ? ? 	1
This time , if you don ' t respond , I will stop communicating with you on this subject ( that their legal status should be displayed ) , as I have given you more than a few chances to refute my arguments / position . 	0

As for etymologies , as I note above , you clearly had no problem with keeping in the article the fact that the word referring to the animal has changed in English because you didn ' t remove the mention of it in your original edit . 	1
Therefore I fail to see how taking the logical next step and explaining why this happened , with multiple reliable sources to back it up , is a problem . 	0
Regarding the " jarring " nature of the word . . . look , I can sympathise . 	0

You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0

If a company makes sprockets , it doesn ' t need to be recognized as a sprocket company by any government in order for an encyclopedia to say that it makes sprockets . 	0
Hamas habitually engages in terrorist activites , as explicitly noted by the entries in both the Britannica and Encarta encyclopedias , which are linked to from the article . 	1
Sure , it would be plagiarism , but it would make a better article and allow many of us to avoid spending our precious time on this earth in Wikipedia battles . 	0
It would be nice if we could just copy the article on Hamas from a real encyclopedia and paste it here . 	1

Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0
The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war . 	1

Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0

My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0
Maybe you could be more specific ? 	0
We can ' t allow some characterizations made by one kind of notable source but disallow other characterizations made by another kind of notable source . 	0
This is a blatant breach of NPOV . 	0
The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

I don ' t think any other religion article breaks " origins " away from " history " and I don ' t think they should - the two terms are synonymous , and they should be discussing the same things . 	0

Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1
It tells the reader the Why . 	0
The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0

Your point may be valid in a few hundred years at the least , when continuous demographic changes will finally have an impact . 	0
But to say it now is jut ridiculous . 	0
Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit â€” realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s â€” and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0

There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0

As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur sources provide a higher level of quality in creating the Beliefs section and representing that content as being approved by the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like for my two sources to be respected because of this designation and because they adhere to Wikipedia policy . 	0
Iommi has been very public about influence from Clapton . 	0
He just had a dispute with Rev . Wright . 	0
However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it . 	0
Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0
Obama ' s dispute was with Rev . Wright , not the religion . 	0
The excuse is that it has been discussed before but what Mr . Saturn says makes sense , that he is United Church of Christ or Protestant . 	0
This is strange that it list Christianity . 	1
What ' s more , the technique of verse Ozzy uses at the end of that song is very much bluesy . 	0
There ' s nothing democratic about a nation where the ruling party came to power via fraud and keeps power the same way . 	0
It is obscene to classify South Africa as a ' liberal democracy ' when their leader is a lifelong member of the communist party and frequently talks about the people , the masses , peoples liberation , etc . Furthermore F . W . De Klerk himself even came out and said the 1994 election was rife with fraud . 	1
With a lifelong member of the South African communist party in power , and communisty party officials frequently invited to attend national conferences and speak at public events , it seems that South Africa ' s government is increasingly taking on a communist appearance . 	0
South Africa ' s government is no different than that of Zimbabwe , a de facto one party state by virtue of fraud , lies , violence , and corruption . 	0

I don ' t know if they ' re moving towards a centrally planned economy but classifying South Africa as a communist country instead of a liberal democracy is more appropriate , at least it deserves consideration . 	0
First things they covered were Zeppelin and Sabbath . 	0
I dont think it detracts from the article to have this in here - it just shows the weakness of the opposing opinion and I prefer to have this exposed . 	0
The radio programme quoted above is similar to other stuff produced on this page in that it contains no hard facts . 	0
There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0
This does not a worldwide scandal make , however , however much some people might wish one . 	0
I have alrready said that in an organisation with over a million priests and religious , examples of any crime can be found if you search hard enough . 	0
There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
There is no vandalism . 	0
This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
And to what end ? 	0
It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

His opinions alone produced nothing . 	0
It ' s not black-or-white . 	0
No , that ' s not at all what science is . 	0
How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0
Strong Oppose - per consistency of every other U . S . city ( except NYC ) 	1
To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0
Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0
I don ' t think this content currently can be improved by editing , and the moment it is improved by removal as it isn ' t supported . 	0

Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0

While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
Please propose textual edits so the discussion can center around concrete improvements to the associated article without distraction from nebulous prolixity . 	0
I would like to remind users to take it to the talk page if they have a problem with any of the content . 	0

Given the nature and history of this article , it would have been nice if PoV-concerns had been mooted and potentially resolved here first , but water over the bridge . 	0
Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
They are clearly biased . 	0
