In the three weeks since I opened this thread I see the gallery has rolled over . 	0
It looks like a gallery the World Book encyclopedia might have at the end of an article . 	0
What occurs to me is that the photos are all fairly positive towards the IDF and for someone looking to see the subject as the subject might present itself , these images do a fair job . 	0
I would say that inclusion in this gallery , which closes a long and detailed article ( with many links to main articles ) should be given the following test : If this gallery was as the end of the article on the Danish military , would you keep it ? 	1

Lets have a quick look at your criticisms : A lot seem to based on a perception , that many people in certain countries with anti-catholic backgrounds have been brought up with , that the Catholic Church was basically an evil , grisly organisation , and that there must be more to back this up . 	0
There is no need to endlessly persist in demanding the use of a source that is unreliable in its own right , and that doesn ' t even meet our inclusion criteria . 	1

A quote can easily state , " translated by the gift and power of god " as long as it is attributed or referenced . 	0

What violates NPOV is stating it without an attribution or reference . 	0
The key issue is that Wikipedia cannot be placed in the position of stating a fact or defining something as true . 	0
I would say that such a statement if vastly superior to the statement that Smith translated the plates " by a unique gift " with gift linking to the article on seer stones . 	0
When I quickly reviewed AAF website it was full of quotes , references to other scholars , etc . More than anything it appears as a gateway site to the work of scholars that address their topic of interest . 	1
many people don ' t know that Catholics were ever persecuted . 	0
Laws banning Catholicism were there before the Pope ' s excommunication , in fact they were the reason for it . 300 priests alone were killed in England ( excluding Ireland ) in Elizabeth ' s reign just for saying mass . 	0
The definition of holocaust denial ( according to wikipedia ) is : " Holocaust denial consists of claims that the genocide of Jews during World War II — usually referred to as the Holocaust [ 1 ] — did not occur at all , or that it did not happen in the manner or to the extent historically recognized . " no " claims " are being made , so it cannot be classified as a holocaust denial , especially given that he specifically addressed that in numerous occasions to clear that he is NOT denying the holocaust . 	0
You offer part of Europe and we will support it . " this is called : " Expressing doubt " & " Questioning " - not " denying " - as it is well described in the news item from wikinews This is especially clear when it follows a remark about the special laws prohibiting to question the holocaust in europe . 	0

I would love to see if there IS a picture that would be usable for the article , but . . . to be honest , I don ' t think the " pictures of an abortion " have a place here . 	1
Although I tend to lean almost unilaterally toward adding pictures to articles ( because it definitely makes them more appealing ) , I ' m very much torn on this one . 	0
That doesn ' t mean that people shouldn ' t see them , but it does make it difficult to say they deserve a mention on an NPOV article . 	0

As you are no doubt well aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	0
The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1

In truth , the LAShTAL . com resources are significantly more extensive and comprehensive than the existing Wikipedia article . 	0
I would posit that much of the information contained in the Wikipedia article is sourced from the research and effort of the LAShTAL . com membership . 	0
For completeness , the Wikipedia article should point the user to LAShTAL . com . 	0
The LAShTAL . com site is the home of the Aleister Crowley Society . 	0
Based on a review of the LAShTAL . com site and WP : ELNO , I agree with Acsociety ' s assessment that the Aleister Crowley article ahould reference the LAShTAL . com site . 	1
The LAShTAL . com resources are much more than collection links to existing work - they comprise the most accurate , scholarly analysis of the man and his works in any format . 	0
As such , it is the recognized comprehensive authority on the life and works of Crowley and the repository of much original work on the topic . 	0

Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

I don ' t disrespect them , but one can ' t really compare them with a band that ' s generally considered one of the best rock bands through all times . 	0
I looked them up when you mentioned them first , and they were what I expected ; very similar to Zeppelin , very blues-influenced , and not heavy metal at all , but understandably influential , even if Sabbath never heard them . 	0
Actually , neither one of the bands were as bluesy as Zeppelin , I would say . 	0

So if Smith used the term sect , it does not necessarily follow that he meant church . 	1
So I ' m slightly hesitant to use that word , but I don ' t have a strong objection either way . 	0
In standard Christian terminology , which would have been understood by Smith , the word sect does not necessarily mean precisely the same thing as church . 	0
A " church " is a particular body of believers , while the term sect can ( and originally did ) refer to a religious " path " or tradition . 	0

I think a good place to start would be addressing this source , and what wording might be appropriate for that . 	0
Talking about it here is better . 	0
In answer to you question , yes , a reference from a medical journal would be great , although we can consider other sources . 	0
I agree with that in general , but it seems to me that a reliable newspaper is a good enough source to justify putting in something from it , if qualified , and that ' s the edit I made . 	0
But it was reverted , and now we have a small edit war here , and we should stop that right away . 	0
Well , here ' s why you should . 	0
You want to add material to the article , and thus the burden is on you to provide sources , and you have supplied some , but some editors are not happy with those sources , my guess is that the basic objection is that these sources are not as good as others available . 	1
But if there are any medical journal articles that address this , yes , please let ' s take a look at those . 	0

If you believe that any restriction on land ownership is communist , then I ' m afraid you have a definition of " communist " that varies wildly from the commonly accepted definition . 	0
In any case , this argument is entirely pointless : it ' s quite clear that the generally accepted view is that South Africa is a liberal democracy . 	1
Nope , I believe the Soviet Union was really communist . 	0

If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0

( Tiny minority views such as " Darwinism is a pseudoscience " would be mentioned neither here nor in Darwinism . ) 	0
As long as we annotate items so as to mention balancing views per WP : WEIGHT and WP : ASF , we ' re within NPOV . 	0

So if you ' re not being ' recentist ' ( yech , neologism ) , how do you justify putting this in the lead and not the other really big controversies that I mentioned earlier ? 	0

Popular discourse elevates Sabbath ' s importance to the detriment of their contemporaries , when even a basic review of the most important and in-depth sources on metal establish that Sabbath wasn ' t the sole progenitor of metal , and they weren ' t as unique as some believe them to be . 	0

Nominally South Africa is a capitalist democracy , in actuality it is more in line with communist tyranny . 	0

If we make such a statement--quotes or no quotes--it has to be attributed to somebody , not just stated flatly like it was in DeltoidNoob ' s text . 	0

There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe , and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC , so it ' s not necessarily a new thing either . 	0
The first part of the first sentence ( " A sex abuse scandal involving around 0 . 02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse " ) sounds fine . 	0
The rest of it degenerates into blatant POV . 	1

Since sexual deviancy is a characteristic of human beings , and not just Catholics , as a WP editor with the quality of the article in mind , I second Storm Rider ' s opinion that mention of sexual abuse by clergy does not belong in the lead . 	1
Westcoast , as far as I can tell Storm Rider ' s argument is not that the problem is that of " a collection of a few sinful individuals " but that the normal rates of human sexual deviance are going to be found in the Catholic Church . 	0
Thank you Storm Rider for some sensible comments here . 	0

Is it possible , or will it ever be possible to " jump start " someone ' s brain like a car and get their blood flowing again ? 	0
But is that really the end , either ? 	0
Still , I am reasonable enough to agree to keep it out if you present some other argument ( other than censorship ) 	0
I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0

The CNN article said that : " Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells . 	0
Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0
At minimum this statement should be seperated into two statements to make it more accurate . 	0

Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
