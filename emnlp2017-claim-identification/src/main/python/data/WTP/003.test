There is no need to include a specific band just because one source ( MTV , a commercial source , whose purpose is to increase album sales ) includes this band , when dozens of sources discredit the application of this term , and when the article for the term uses musical phrases that have nothing to do with the style of music that this band actually performs . 	1

Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0

Neither of those terms make clear , as the Easter Bunny article does , that Santa is a myth . 	0

A real person can be " legendary " . 	0
" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
I am guessing no one is up for that . 	0
Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0

The account by people who the Israeli media seem to accept as being close cousins , is that the maternal grandmother was a Jew who was married at first to a Jewish man who mistreated her . 	0
Her daughter became Gaddafi ' s mother . 	0
She ran away with a Muslim sheikh , converted to Islam . 	0
In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1
If born to a Jewish mother , you qualify as a Jew and at least some authorities maintain it does not matter if your mother--born Jewish--aposticizes and joins another religion . 	0

It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0

It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0

The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0
Is the section really a problem as is ? 	0

Defining LGBT is what wikilinks are for and doesn ' t need to be done here , and certainly not in the lead paragraph . 	0
First of all , this is an article about San Francisco . 	0
Including the LGBT population as one of the many recognizable elements of San Francisco - along with the fog , the architecture , etc - is by far the most neutral way of including it in this article . 	0
Second of all , the sentence which I removed is not in parallel structure with the rest of the items which are listed . 	0

We cannot whitewash the article to remove , hide , or overly dilute negatives ; that is a violation of WP : NPOV . 	1
Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0
An idea is what this article does : Traditional heavy metal . 	0

There are other WP pages where I have enjoyed much better give-and-take and been able to contribute more to the developing consensus . 	0
So , what is being implied here ? 	0
That there has been " political " impact in the US or Europe ? 	0

Yes , the photo shows a cultural connection between the IDF and Israeli civilians but it is not a relevant photo regarding any specific area because the photo shows no context as to where it was taken . 	0
If the four men were standing in front of a sign saying " Efrat " or a recognizable landmark like the Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza , it would be a relevant picture . 	0
Again , how do you know the photo is of an area in the WB or GS ? 	0
sorry , look the page [ 5 ] in the box the line says " Albums & Songs - > Music Genre " . . . 	0
What ' s your point ? 	0
Many are propaganda , many are not . 	0
We would obviously not include a biased image . 	0
- 	0
When you look through most other photos , you see the caption is a description given to what the user sees in the photo . 	0
As I understand it , a caption given by an uploader or by a flikr stream owner is unverifiable and as such not according to WP standards . 	0
Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0
First we have to decide whether the Origin and Mission section is a problem . 	0
So that fact cannot be argued to be included in the leading / initial description of the " Hamas " wiki page . 	0
I appreciate you pointing out that you agree with that , and hope that you understand it was NOT my intention to imply that because of their status today , Hamas ' previous ( or present ) actions are to be define in a different way . 	0
as agreed upon by the leaders of Palestine and the British leaders of the time … . . 	0
if you don ' t accept THAT proof . . . . . there ' s always the declaration on Nov . 15 1988 - http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27a/099.html . . . . . 	0
This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0
Now , I realize we are talking about a global situation , and not just one that relates to the U . S . . 	0
Would it not seem logical , then , to specifically state that the designation / label / view of Hamas is a matter of debate / discussion / confussion within international community standards ? 	1
Their existence as the governing body of the Palestinian state / country / territories is NOT a matter of debate / discussion / confussion . 	1
It is a fact . 	1
If anyone wants to open up a discussion of the cigarette tax they may , but inclusion does seem unlikely to gain consensus . 	0

after reviewing the sources on the matter i believe the translation to something like " wipe zionism from the pages of history " seems to be more credible . 	1
with free online translation services there is no excuse not to go check the origin when available . 	0
we are discussing in english things said in parsi so we have to be extra careful and doubel check any resource claiming to bring a translation . 	1
as for the topic discussed , i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation " wipe israel off the map " is a misquote . 	0
I think these concerns should be addressed before the paragraph in question is returned . 	0
Why it should only be Judas I have no idea ; especially when my justification is sourced : http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/queen/biography ( 	0
If it ' s any consolation , the Presidency of Barack Obama article uses the word criticism four times , and the Presidency of George W . Bush article doesn ' t use the word at all . 	0
I ' ve been asked to put this up on the talk page as to why Queen should be mentioned in the introduction of the article along with Judas Priest . 	0
Which you clearly fail to understand . 	0
No consensus for adding that example . 	0

So it ' s correct . 	0
That portion is actually correct , as Carol Moseley Braun was the Democratic nominee for that senate seat in 1998 and lost to Peter Fitzgerald . 	1
Obama was the next Democratic nominee for that senate seat , with Alexi Giannoulias preceding Obama . 	0

I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt ( which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth ) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit , coney , cunny etc . I ' m assuming you ' ll be ok with this so I ' m going to go ahead and make the necessary changes . 	0
- - 	0
I would be willing to consider this , but I suspect such an article may quickly find itself either merged back into this article or deleted . 	0
I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship . 	0
I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1
Geography doesn ' t have flags , if the cross was ever used for Ireland it was for the political entity on the Island at the time 	0
What the article does is describe the organization neutrally , and explains who considers them a terrorist organization and why . 	0
" Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by . . . " is far more neutral and even then a declarative " Hamas is a terrorist organization . . . " . 	0
If you are here to push the latter , then you ' re going to be in for some sore disappointment around here since the Wikipedia project is not to be used as a battle field . 	1
I changed the sentence , replacing it with a summary of the webpage and a link to it . 	0
Shlomi is absolutely right that the old sentence was at least misleading , and the webpage he linked to gives a very nice explanation of why evolution doesn ' t violate the 2nd law . 	0
But there have been enough wars involving such states in modern times that it really is something for which MILHIST ought to have developed techniques . 	0
I think this article suffers from some of that with glamorous pitures of equipment women soldiers , disucssion of the code of ethics in most of the article followed by the scandal . 	0
It would follow Wikipedia guidelines better if say discussion of scandals associated with particular wars occurred in the place where those wars are mentioned and if the more extreme ethical abuses were included in the discussion of the ethical cide . 	0
Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0
Do you get an article which mainly consists of blurb about how wonderful and saintly a particular person or institution is written by their fans or employees and then it has a subsection about how it has been claimed on an obscure website that they eat babies . 	0
It is of the nature of occupying armies that they abuse the occupied . 	0
Obviously it would be somewhat peculiar to have a controversies section in Roman Army saying that it sometimes sacked cities , raping , killing or enslaving large chunks of the population . 	0
also we should be aware of WP : Recentism and spend too much time on complaints about what happenned in Gaza just because it is fresh in our minds . 	0
On Wikifan ' s point about there not being similr coveerage elsewhere it might be worth an approach to the WP : MILHIST project and suggest they produce guidelines on how to deal with this . 	1
Given the possible perceived conflict of interest , I should probable recuse myself from editing any rabbit-related articles . 	0

As I ' m new to editing this page , you surmised correctly that I was unaware of any previous editing decisions such as having to abide by your consensus-approved outline . 	1
So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1
If you and the other editors overrule this content ' s inclusion here , on what page — dealing with combat ethics in the IDF — would it belong ? 	0
I see there ' s no main article on Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct . - - 	0
But , if this isn ' t obvious I guess it shouldn ' t be stated like that in the intro . 	0

There is presumption ( logical and statistically supported , but still presumption ) of HIV infection as the cause of their deaths . 	0
More extensive description should , IMO , address issues such as the fact that most AIDS victims in Africa were never confirmed as HIV positive by testing . 	1
I have previously commented in Talk on the irrelevance of social issues such as orphans in the lead of an article about a virus ( which is NOT the same as the syndrome , which is a specific medical term distinct from disease ) . 	0
To me , this suggests that the HIV article needs " more extensive description " , including possible revision of the lead . 	1
The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

If nothing passes muster here on Talk , I am clearly OK with not mentioning it in the lede at all , but the effort is worth it , an ounce of prevention . . . 	0
So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0
In theory , a good idea . 	1
We have a similar section in Bush ' s article about Katrina . 	0
However , your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification ; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and / or BP — and it undoubtedly exists — is the Christian Science Monitor ( who , I ' ll hazard a guess , supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened ) , and I don ' t really think they ' re a reliable source . 	1
I suggest that the CSMonitor source be removed and replaced with reputable print or broadcast news institutions , instead . 	0

Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0
While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0

We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0
