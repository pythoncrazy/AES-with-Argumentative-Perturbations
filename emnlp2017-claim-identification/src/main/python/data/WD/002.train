However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0
I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done / evaluated on an individual basis . 	0
ed kid w / the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg . 	0
ed . child whether doing so is desired by them & beneficial for their child . 	0
The fact of the matter is that doing so ( calming down a student ) is not their job or their responsibility . 	0
Some schools , though , such as my dcs ' , will repeatedly place a reg . 	0
Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it ' s just not something popular to speak out about here . 	0
But in general , I don ' t think I could ever be convinced that it ' s " wrong " for me to be anti-homeschool . 	0
The best musicians tend to make the most money . 	0
Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0
On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0

Forget the obscene fact that Beyonce makes about 200 times what the concertmaster for the New York Philharmonic does , they both do quite well when compared to the average piano teacher who gives lessons through the Jewish Community Center or the YMCA . 	0
You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer . 	0
If schools would agree to this , then why not ? 	0
If we allow Christian students to pray , you must allow Wiccan students to pray , Jewish , Islamic , Muslim . 	0
You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols . 	0
The best accountants tend to make the most money . 	0
The best writers — business and entertainment — tend to make the most money . 	0
Now I ’ m not saying that Alex Rodriguez deserves to make more money than Miguel Cabrera , but that they and every other professional ball player make a lot more money than minor leaguers , those in foreign leagues , semi-pros and beer league softballers . 	0
Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0
Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Let me know what you think . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
I find them both rather frightening . 	0
The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it ' s not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child ' s education in order to keep that failing system going . 	1
What a joke ! ! ! 	0
I just spent the better part of a day with the faculty of the all-girls Ellis School in Pittsburgh , where I was reminded of all the best aspects of my own education around gender and gender roles . 	0
But if prayer really works , then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God ’ s existence or His sovereignty over this world . 	0
Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
The survival of excellent girls ' and boys ' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man . 	0
The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	0
It ' s an opinion . 	0
It ' s not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it ' s better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled . 	1
And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward , just that the overall " School " experience to me is very important for development of all children , and to me , that can ' t be entirely replicated at home . 	0
I have reasons behind it . 	0
Yes I do . 	0
Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids , religion , wanting to keep control on kids , special snowflake syndrome , etc ? 	0
Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that ? 	0
I ' m sorry but I do . 	0
Especially not here where there are a lot of highly intelligent people who break the mold IMO for " Every day " mothers in lots of ways . 	0
No way . 	0
We celebrate the suddenly disproportionate success of girls in the conventional academic realm ( they do so much better in high school that they disadvantage one another when it comes to competitive college admission ) while we wonder whether one of our unending culture wars is on boys . 	0
But Mrs . Cooper also has a more immediate reason for encouraging prayer . 	0
And it ’ s a reminder that they can apply the principles of their faith – like hard work and honesty – to school . ” 	0
“ It shows the students that we understand they are spiritual beings . 	0
“ I ask the teachers to say a prayer at each assembly , ” says Principal Cooper . 	0
But prayer seems to be a de facto norm . 	0
Education for boys and young men is changing , and it ' s heartening , for example , to note that old-fashioned expressions of stereotypical maleness , like those caught on tape when Rutgers coach Mike Rice went off on his players , excite general shock and outrage . 	0
But a school ’ s governing body – typically made up of parents , community members , and teachers – can approve the inclusion of certain religious practices , including prayers , if it feels those practices are in the school ’ s best interest . 	0
By law , South African public schools are not allowed to promote a particular faith . 	0
I would look at the subjects on offer . 	0
Curricula increasingly include diverse viewpoints , and access to self and creativity are as much a part of boys ' school programs as lacrosse and basketball ; schools work hard to imbue students with more beneficent ideas of what it means to be male , with responsibilities and difference equal parts of the equation . 	0
Two years ago , an instructor at COSAT was teaching students Arabic prayers , and sometimes asking them to recite the prayers in class . 	0
She ’ s Muslim , and she worries what would happen if she didn ’ t allow prayer at the school . 	0
But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to “ initiate this program as designed ” and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
I couldn ’ t place the scripture . 	0
5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
The other teacher did not . 	0
It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
I mean , c ’ mon ! 	0
How pathetic . 	0
Are we so weak minded ? 	0
Wow , here we go again . 	0
Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
The level of differentiated instruction required to develop some functional skills is not possible in mainstream classrooms . 	0
That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ” 	0
The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don ’ t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
What ’ s next ? 	0
Today , parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool . 	0
There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school . 	0
Some offer these classes throughout the week and you can choose which classes to take . 	0
Others offer classes once a week and parents teach . 	0
In fact , I didn ' t really grasp geometry till I started gardening . 	0
Today ' s homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent ' s assistance through DVDs and online courses . 	0
Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0
You can participate in any sport or any extracurricular function via these co-ops that you can in public school . 	0
I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds . 	0
Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
Consideration must be given to the potential of a child to function as an adult , and the skills and behaviours needed to achieve this . 	0
Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
Forced prayer isn ’ t prayer anyway . 	0
When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
Inclusion , where all children - regardless of ability - are educated together , has been debated for decades but special-needs education has not changed substantially . 	0
I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ’ s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
How is that for socialization ? 	0
One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0
The debate is fundamentally a human rights issue , grounded in principles of normalisation , that all children should enjoy a non-segregated , unrestricted lifestyle with full access to culturally normative resources . 	0
Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead . 	1
There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging “ between a man and his brother , ” much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0
Fortunately , my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time . 	0

Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0

My daughter will be 5 in Sept . and she is going to Kindergarten . 	0
She is very excited to go and I don ’ t want her to be behind . 	0
She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc ’ s but not all of them . 	0
She is small for age , but so was I . I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad . 	0
I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability , but I learned to cope . 	0
I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school . 	0
All affairs of life become subject to state , rather than individual control . 	0
That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent . 	0
This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
I have a few acquaintances who couldn ' t manage to teach successfully at public high schools in Western Sydney and went to the private system for a relatively easy life . 	0
Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as " religious " . 	0
Rev . Ingram documents and points out that “ a broad , organized attack reaching into high places is under way to remove the third commandment from legal standing in the United States and throughout the world . ” 	0
It ' s in danger of becoming one of those joke laws , like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester , and needs to be removed . 	0
If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0
About 80 percent of South Africans self-identify as Christians . 	0

“ I like the prayer , ” a tenth-grader named Sinoxolo told me after this morning ’ s assembly . 	0
It ’ s often given in Xhosa – the first language of most COSAT students . 	0
At COSAT , school assemblies usually begin with a prayer , delivered by a teacher . 	0
They have a 100% college acceptance rate ! 	0
COSAT ’ s principal , Phadiela Cooper , says there are two kinds of students at the school : Christians , and Christians who don ’ t practice as much . 	0

Now the government is talking about kids being obese so we have to have health food . 	0
Its not so much what they eat as much as what they do ! 	0
Well the Federal Government got involved and that is what has ruined schools . 	0
Also school has dumbed down since I went . 	0
I would say to myself in frustration . 	0

For four long years , grades six through nine , I attended a rigid , traditional all-girls school . 	0
In 2013 , is single-sex education really the way to go ? 	1
Much more my style . 	0
Now days kids want to sit and play xbox , Nintendo , computers , ipads , or ipods or ride four wheelers when they should be out playing or riding bicycles . 	0
I part yea parents need to take an active role in their child ' s health and education , but if the school fails to sucks then let them put them in private school . 	0
The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class . 	0
Is we choose to send our children to a different , more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education , So be it . 	0
And We are going to do everything in our power to follow that conviction . 	0
I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the " moral standards " ( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her . 	0

School can be very bad for you . 	1
For some people it can be a catastophic experience from which they never recover . 	0
To claim otherwise is rank ignorance . 	0
Being an involved parent with kids in public schools , it doesn ' t matter what policies I try to bring about , or suggestions I bring , or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of , things will NOT change . 	0

The racialized question of separate but equal in education was answered by Brown v . 	0
I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools . 	1

This is bat insane ? 	0
Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if " everyone does it " that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education ! ! ! 	0
No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the " greater good " if at all possible . 	0
Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
Our “ Yes ” should be “ Yes , ” and our “ No ” should mean “ No . ” 	0
She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0

And what are we supposed to do with the many children who have learning difficulties , behaviour problems or specific disabilities ? 	0
I ' m all right Jack . . . bugger you is a great attitude , especially for a teacher . 	0
The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0
This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies . 	0
Best decision they ever made . 	1
My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8 . 	1
My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school . 	0
I was ahead of my peers by high school . 	0
Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively . 	0
My kids attend public school now and I detest it . 	0
In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0
If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
COSAT ’ s governing body hasn ’ t made a formal decision on religious practices . 	0
Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
Once they start working , or going to college , they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in , and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old . 	0
It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world . 	0
Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy . 	0
( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith . 	0
I don ' t know about the rest of Virginia , but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools . 	1
The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some . 	0
I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the “ least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ” 	0
There is about 5 cases a year for the whole province of Quebec , mostly very immature children . 	0
Ours is Sept . 30th , and no one ” red shirts ” . 	0
What IS the cut-off date ? 	0
He sounds ready . 	0
Everybody in my family ( my siblings , husband ’ s sibling ) skipped a year in school i . e . moved forward faster . 	0
Three of my girls were born in August , but there is no question of holding them back . 	1
There should NOT be any praying in school . 	1
Praying is a home thing , or a church , temple , synagogue or what have you exercise . 	0
Prayer is not for public consumption . 	0
Our esteemed government should also change the words of the national anthem to eliminate the sentence that is a prayer . 	0
Canada is a secular nation . 	0
Let ' s keep it that way . 	0
Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
Just do what ' s best for your kids . 	0
Private schools don ' t promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles . 	0
Also , the private schools don ' t teach all of this anti American social justice crap . 	0
It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities , and that they can play on either team in sports , male or female . 	0
Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago . 	0
I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois . 	0
The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore . 	1
It ' s pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don ' t belong here . 	0
My kids didn ' t speak Spanish , so I pulled them out , and they went to private schools after that . 	0
If you don ' t do well , it isn ' t necessarily the school ' s fault . 	0
Public school is what you and your parents make of it . 	1
Everyone I know went to public school and on to college . 	0
It really is up to the student to do the work . 	0
Maybe schools were better then . 	0
We didn ' t feel unprepared . 	0
I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
Perhaps some Homeschool kids are ' awkward " and all that , but all the ones I know , are not . 	0
My friend and her family are Homeschoolers and they are all friendly and funny and wonderfully nice people . 	0
etc . . . . why would you put your child in that situation ? 	0
( No offense to anyone here , don ' t take this wrongly . ) 	0
My parents decided to Homeschool me ( and the rest of my siblings ) because they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools . 	0
All the drugs , swearing , bullying , condoms being handed out to young children who shouldn ' t even know what sex is yet , evolution . 	0
But besides that , God has commanded us to train up our children , not give them to someone else where you have no control over what they are taught . 	0
And what they are taught is directly against him . 	0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1JJW-JgHVac This film changed my perspective on public schools tremendously . 	0
Here is the preview . 	0
And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
Social advancement ? 	0
Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
It ' s human nature . 	0
The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
But then everyone is . 	0
But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
Public schools are fad driven . 	0
Remember new math ? 	0
For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0
No one does . 	0
I try not to be anti-homeschooling , but . . . it ' s just hard for me . 	1
I really haven ' t met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right , including myself . 	0
I apologize if what I ' m saying offends any of you - that ' s not my intention , I know that there are many homeschooled children who do just fine , but that hasn ' t been my experience . 	0
I have a friend who is 16 , the same age as me . 	0
She has never watched a PG-13 movie . 	0
She has never been on the internet . 	0
She only reads books that her parents pick out for her . 	0
She is not allowed to go outside by herself . 	0
She is not allowed to listen to non-religious music . 	0
She has no idea how people get pregnant . 	0
That means adults engaging with children during play to help them develop negotiation skills or to share complex ideas . 	0
One way parents can help prepare their children is to ensure that there is adequate facilitated play in preschool . 	0
Gone are the days when kindergarten teachers hold up a letter and ask the class to name it . 	0
This isn ’ t your mother ’ s kindergarten ! 	0
What ’ s a parent to do ? 	0
Today , kindergarten is drawing , writing , literacy , reading , and science and math and all those subjects that kids didn ’ t used to get until first or second grade . ” 	0
Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same . 	0
I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school ( one that I had done a lot of background checking into first ) . 	0
Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0
There ' s no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today ' s times . 	1
The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways . 	0
There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down . 	0
The neighboring county public schools are the same . 	0
Home learners ranked in the 84th percentile , compared to publicly schooled students , who were drastically lower in the 23rd . 	0
He conducted a study in which he administered the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test to identify mature and well-adapted behaviors in children . 	0
Dr . Thomas Smedley believes that homeschoolers have superior socialization skills , and his research supports this claim . 	0
So how do these different settings affect children ? 	0
Isn ’ t this where real community interaction and contacts are made ? 	0
They visit museums , fire departments , state capital buildings , national , regional and community parks , farms , nature centers , libraries and churches . 	0
What experrience do you have dear ? 	0
Bless your heart . 	0
When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing . 	0
The mass socialization within schools has brought about abundant delinquent behavior within our nation ’ s youth , reports education researcher , Dr . Michael Slavinski . 	0
What about negative socialization ? 	0
As you know , our own little Billy ( not so little , any more though ) is now in the second grade . 	0
Children not wishing to participate were to be allowed to stand out in the hallway during prayer time . 	0
Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church . 	0
I ' m proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon ! 	1
Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight , like quality education , not quantity education , and not buying unneeded items like bleachers , I ' ll consider sending my kids . . . . wait , nevermind ! 	0
No I won ' t ! 	0
As you know , We ’ ve been working real hard in our town to get prayer back in our schools . 	0
When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner , then that is where one of the problems lies . 	0
What a stupid argument ! 	0
We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
I ' m sure that if we did away with private schools the government would then fix all the problems wiht public education . 	0
Liberal lean with putting the blame on people that wish to provide a better education for their children . 	0
Friggin idiots . 	0
NOT ! 	0
She may not learn as much or be as challenged , but take a deep breath and live with that . 	0
If you promise to do a thing and don ’ t do it , it means the weakening of your moral nature . 	0
Well last night I caught 60 Minutes ' rebroadcast of Redshirting - Holding kids back from kindergarten , which I had missed back in March , and I was , once again , all in a huff . 	0
This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0
( Remember my rant last fall - Redshirting . 	0
. 	0
. 	0
What about tomorrow ? ) 	0
I ' ve said it before , and I ' ll say it again . 	0
. 	0
. 	0
Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0

FFRF admonishes that the event is an “ ostentatious display of piety at school . ” 	0
My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0
One high school where I taught had almost 2 , 000 students ; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal ' s office . 	0
Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools . 	0
Neighborhood schools were community gathering places , where parents , kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other . 	0
Run , don ' t walk , to the nearest private school . 	1
Public schools are not about education ; they are about social engineering . 	0
I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
My advice to parents ? 	0
It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
Good luck and I hope I helped . 	0
I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0
Jewelry ? 	0
Purse ? 	0
We had a Regina George , Gretchen Wieners , Karen Smith and , of course , a Cady Heron . 	0
Really , it was like Mean Girls ! 	0
Who makes your sneakers ? 	0
Just because we had a strict uniform , by no means did that mean there wasn ’ t competition wardrobe-wise . 	0
I was sent on a wild goose chase from clique to clique . 	0
I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , “ Sorry , are we done here ? ” , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
Anyways , I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class , you should try to get him to excel in something . 	0
Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
Anything , it can be his favorite school subject ( in my case , math ) , an instrument ( piano ) , or something else he likes ( in my case , ballet ) . 	0
Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! 	1
I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
She is a total marxist moron . 	0
YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
It is because of what our society has become . 	0
It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
All parents carefully consider their child ' s education and those decisions are not taken lightly . 	0
I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional ? 	0
I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1
This is Poppycock ! 	0
It ' s the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs . 	0
But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education . 	0
If Mom and Dad feel they are equipped to home school their children , so be it . 	0
You can pray whenever you want . 	0
Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . ” 	0
I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
Studies have shown girls perform better ( academically ) in all-girls high schools than in co-ed . 	0
And it is the cornerstone of a child ’ s well-being , ” Densmore told me . 	0
The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
I have only one more problem . 	0
Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
This is where the difference is . 	0
Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools . 	0
They cannot correct errors , cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students , assign homework , or expect respect from the students . 	0
No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
No matter when your child starts kindergarten , it ’ s a new beginning for him or her—and for you . 	0
remember , keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don ' t like is a moral crime . 	0
Well this has been fun but I have to go back to work . 	0
Have a nice day . 	0
I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have : 1 . 	0
Additionally , many homeschooling families belong to like-minded groups that meet regularly and participate in field trips . 	0
The more people leave , the worse its going to become . 	0
Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible . 	0
My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school . 	0
When we moved to an areas with better schools , we would go to public schools or magnet schools . 	0
We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible . 	0
Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
Why ? 	0
My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0
When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests . 	0
He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test , which identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity . 	0
Why don ' t students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them ( e . g . Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0
Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group ? 	0
When does it end ? 	0
We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else . 	0
( Seriously CBC , why does it take 3 hours to get a comment posted ) : ANYWAY , Here we go again . 	0
Hi Carol This is such sound advise and thank goodness there are Head Teachers like yourself out there ! ! 	0
My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child I agree too , that although labels are scary for Parents , with them , the Children do get more benefits and support , so can be a positive thing Fran 	0
These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ’ s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and “ too judgmental ” of their community and the world in general . 	0
President Theodore Roosevelt once said , “ To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ” 	0
This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the “ lack of social skills ” as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0
What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one . 	0
What a load of BS . 	0
All I can say is WOW ! ! ! 	0
That ' s right , I do not give a s**t about the public schools system , I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school . 	0
I never post on these things but today I had to . 	0
However it may take a little while to really settle down to an “ absence of a rigid routine ” before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0
Greater Freedom “ The morning rush to catch the school bus … it all seems to belong to some distant world now , ” smiles Mariam , who has been homeschooling her only child for the past two years . 	0
I don ’ t know if any school can nourish her love for science as much as my husband and I do . ” 	0
She is my one and only and I want to go all out to nurture her interest . 	0
She simply loves doing what we do . 	0
We do science experiments , go on nature walks , explore the environment around us and create our own worksheets . 	0
“ My daughter Pat loves science . 	0
“ I find the homeschooling system very supportive of the child and his needs ” says Mariam , mother of a seven year old only child . 	0
( check if your state has any restrictive legal requirement in connection with this ) . 	0
I ’ m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
I could hardly wait to hear about Mrs . Smith ’ s prayer . 	0
Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality . 	0
I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions ; or otherwise , for none . 	1
Doesn ’ t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0
This is only a " compelling " argument to the MSNBC boobs who wrote this . 	0
Cooperative education ? 	0
A new , and sound , study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive . 	0
Mainstreaming ? 	0
At the Tech school where I taught seniors once had five hours of shop class in the trade they came there to learn . 	0
I attended a single sex high school some 40 years ago . 	0
Granted that was a different day but still I cherish the memory . 	0
Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction . 	0
If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
“ Okay . ” 	0

You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
There are some great studies coming out of Canada and are even being tried in some U . S . schools . 	0
The data indicates that children born Jan . -April outperform both physically and academically than their peers born May-Dec . It indicates that those born June-Dec . should be held back from kindergarten a year . 	1
Problem is too many parents want to ship them out sooner than later to eliminate day care expenses and having them around another year . 	0
We used to call it " being held back " where I grew up . . . 	0
" Parents make that decision for all kinds of different reasons . 	0

Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
I get it : You want an exceptional arts program and computer animation and maybe even Mandarin . 	0
They can use tutors , courses , other home educating parents , older children , other specialists with other skills and knowledge , books , science kits , a bought curriculum , internet resources etc etc . Home education is for most a community enterprise . 	0
You want a cohesive educational philosophy . 	0
Her son , now 13 , has a best friend one year younger than he is . 	0
Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
I asked them to tell me why . 	0
I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0

The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues . 	0
I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0
She was ready , I sent her . 	0
We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference . 	0
So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue . 	0

The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem . 	0

What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
Why ? 	0
They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0

Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
It ’ s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
It ’ s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
It ’ s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0

My son was born in December ( cut-off Dec . 31 ) and I have been a little worried for him because they would want him to start JK when he ' s only 3 ! 	0

Besides , you need to think of the kid ' s future . 	0
I ' m not pleased with the full-day kindergarten coming in , but I ' ll worry about that when it gets closer . 	0
( he ' s 2 now ) I thought of holding him back , but my husband was always bored in school and so if he ' s smart like his daddy it might actually work out very well for him to be a bit younger than the other kids . 	0
A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
If all the others are graduating high school at 17 , why does he need to be there until he ' s 18 ? 	0

Centres where students with special educational needs are truly incorporated , and valued , as part of a learning community that extends into the broader community . 	0
Homeschool was very different when I was in school . 	0
From this perspective , the overall design of the school space can be reconceptualised . 	0
Consider a school built around learning centres , where teams of specialist educators work together to support all learners to reach their potential . 	0
Incorporating a technology centre , where some students are developing ' ' apps ' ' while others are learning basic internet search techniques ; a literacy centre , where some engage in text analysis while others learn sight words ; an environmental centre , where some workshop sustainability issues while others learn how to use public transport ; and so on . 	0
Centres that do not exist solely to educate children from 9am to 3pm but , potentially , are used 24 hours a day and seen as essential community spaces . 	0
What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0

After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0

It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
I think it ' s a desperate shame - the poor kid is being deprived of an education and the opportunity to mix with other children . 	0
In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0

The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
We choose to be the primary influence in our children ’ s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs . 	0
Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games , and 1 / 2 the class did not speak English , in the same class ! 	0
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
I wish . 	0
No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
And so children die . 	0
If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
Why would anyone write an article sighting that parents are " bad " for choosing private over public , let me guess , probably a progressive liberal who feels that ALL children need to be indoctrinated with garbage and forced sexuality that is not age appropriate . 	0
It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0

lurker here . . there is only mainstreaming where I live in Canada . . ALL special needs not matter what the handicap is . . or how severe go into regualr classes . . they do go to assisted learning classes for about 1 hr / day to get help w / reading etc . . this works awesome ! ! . . 	1

I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
Lets keep it that way . 	0
There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
It ' s not . 	0
4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
I know which I respect more . 	0
Many others , however , persisted in the more difficult environment and added immense value to disadvantaged students . 	0
I think it all depends on the childs individual development and personality . 	0
I am having the opposite with my youngest , he misses the cut of by 9days but I know will be ready . 	0
He will be 3 in July and will be going into the pre-school class at day care then because he is physically , emotionally and intelectually up to this level . 	0
While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0

If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
“ It calms me . ” 	0
They deserve better . 	0
This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

Others may differ , but I always think , isn ’ t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
My view on the subject is no . 	1
We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0

He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
Mornings would be ugly . 	0

Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0

This statement . . . “ There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school , ” Benedikt wrote . . . . is absolutely a lie ! 	0
You say she has a compelling argument . . . 	0
I know we all have to work extra hard to keep these private schools running and that is also teaching our children persistence . . . and how to care for one another without depending on Uncle Sam to come in and pick up the pieces . . . are you kidding me by judging all parents who know and believe in a Higher Power than themselves . . . now that is a refreshing statement for Ms . Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children . 	0
I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are " bad " and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character . . . how dare this person call us bad if we chose to use our private schools . . . as a parent of a terrific private school system . . . 	0

My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0

If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0

To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don ' t invest time in being sexually desirable to men , I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don ' t see themselves as sex objects , rather than designing institutions that say , " we think you can ' t learn around boys because you would have to spend so much time being a sex object . " 	0
But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation . 	0

The stereotype that home learners spend their days isolated from society at kitchen tables with workbooks in hand could be nothing but farther from reality . 	0
The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways . 	0
Let ’ s take a look at this . 	0
There seems to be a myth that homeschoolers do not receive proper socialization . 	0
This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , “ what about socialization ? ” 	0
A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0

Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0

In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
In contrast , a homeschooler ’ s “ classroom ” is the world around him / her . 	0
Parents don ’ t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0

While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
So bored ! 	0
I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0

Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
The top reason my friends say they didn ’ t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ’ t listen to them . 	0
He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
Many readers addressed this saying it ’ s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
I have to say , I ’ m with them . 	0
Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ’ t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
She may be advanced academically , but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that , maturity-wise . 	0

They will find ways to challenge her , the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels . 	0

Is the government supposed to say , OK , we just abandon home-educated kids to the whims of their parents ? 	0
This is after all a free country . 	0
It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
Nonsense . 	0
As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
My daughter goes to an excellent public school in Durbs and their is nothing lacking in the quality of their education . 	0

Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
The writer is an idiot . 	0

I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
I ’ m not saying it ’ s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like " Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . " 	0
I ’ m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
This year it may be homeschool . 	1
Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others – ideals of Christian living . 	0
The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0

Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
Lets see here . 	0
Hmmm . . . . 	0
there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
But , say a classmate has died . 	0
If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then FFRF would not find it “ unfortunate ” that students are encouraged to “ reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ’ s love and forgiveness . ” 	0
In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
The theme of this year ’ s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
This worked really well . 	0
On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0

These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0

The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
Here is my experience . 	0
There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1
For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
He would be one of the youngest kindergarteners–and because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
this was 1970 . 	0
Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
This is nuts . 	0
I went to a crappy high school . 	0
Half a year . 	0
We still have spring and summer before autumn Two whole seasons . 	0
Back-to-school season is far from my mind . 	0
It ’ s snowing as I write this . 	0
My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district ’ s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
In most parts of the country , it ’ s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
But no matter . 	0
After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0

Jesus ’ teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that “ the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain ” ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
Not in Public Schools . 	0
Each and every family has the right to evaluate their child or children and their needs . 	0
I know that there are some very competent and dedicated private school teachers , but in general , how could they outperform public school teachers , who make so much more money ? 	0
Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
One thing is for sure . 	0
Next year it may be public school . 	1
What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
I know nothing about poetry , very little about art , and please don ’ t quiz me on the dates of the Civil War . 	0

The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their “ socialization education ” from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

One of my now close friends told me long after we met that when she initially saw my name and profession on our playgroup roster , she thought , “ oh great . ” 	0
*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0

Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus , or drop them off at a Public School . 	0
When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
Academics ? 	0
Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1
That ' s why we go to church on Sundays , not the local middle school cafeteria . 	0
Personally i ' d go co-ed . 	1
As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
That ' s not a favour , in my opinion . 	0
So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0

Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education , there isn ' t much parents can do . 	0

I am a 12-year-old 6th grader turning 13 in May , so I know what it ’ s like . 	0
In addition , I don ' t like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school . 	0
Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision : In preschool , I had some issues , just like your son . 	0
I like knowing I have a say is what my children are learning . 	0
Yes , I knew my ABCs since 2 , just like him . 	0
I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
No parent would be able to change that in public school unless they are trying to get the school to be more liberal . 	0
Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
I am all for the public school system . 	1
It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
I feel socially confident now , and feel great ( except when I got 91 . 5 / 150 on AMC 10 and 76 . 5 / 150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself ) . 	0
Being at the top of the class is awesome . 	0
A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
It ’ s simple ! 	0
First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
I ' ll make sure to remind the teacher of his tender years if he starts getting poor marks for " scissoring skills " . 	0
Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0

" Respect for all religions " ( the stated mandate ) sounds really good if you ' re a politician . 	0

But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
This is a sticky subject . 	0
Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
Wow . 	0
This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0
Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
This distinction is crucial . 	0
Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0

If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0

An impotent prayer is no threat to anyone . 	0
If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0

I am not one who needs others to make the choices I made to feel better about myself . 	0

Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
But that ’ s not what drives this for me . 	0
And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
Homeschooled children ’ s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ’ household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
Homeschooled children perform better overall in college — from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
This political correctness is making people less tolerant , creating hard feelings and driving an even bigger wedge between people . . 	0
So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ’ s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
Trust me , I know . 	0
First hand . 	0
Learn what ? 	0
The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
It ' s all good . 	0
Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
Expansion of the debate beyond special education to a general education and social issue would be useful . 	0
I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
School and classroom design has not evolved and this has stagnated the inclusion movement . 	0
The school board ' s decision is having the exact opposite effect of what they intended . . 	0
Advocates of a unified schooling system , where all resources and personnel are at one location , are on the right track . 	0
At present , intensive and focused teaching in a segregated classroom is more likely to result in acquisition of functional skills , particularly where learning experiences incorporate real-world exposure . 	0
No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
However , inclusion in our education system is not automatically in the best interest of every child . 	1
I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
The results of the study don ’ t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics — datasets they call it — and came to the same conclusions . 	0
The Lubienskis aren ’ t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
Correct for these factors — in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree — and the public school wins hands down . 	0
It doesn ’ t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
And it doesn ’ t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college . 	0
Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
Each school district is different . 	0
Each classroom environment is different . 	0
Each child is an individual . 	0
I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
What will I do for Leo ? 	0
Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0

Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1

That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
The life lessons learned from interacting with the opposite sex would be the winner for me . 	0
Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
So what is the threat ? 	0
They just don ' t get it . 	0
They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
Interesting . 	0
I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
None of us are perfect . 	0
That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
Actually , I don ’ t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
So in Columbus , Ohio if you can ' t afford private school move to the suburbs . 	0
I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0

As do long-term educational goals : Will my kid still get into Harvard if he starts kindergarten without knowing how to write his name ? 	0
I believe he ’ s ready because : * He knows his ABCs , writes his name , recognizes a few sites words and grasps basic math concepts . 	0
For me , the decision was made long ago : Kindergarten get ready for Ryan . 	0
Where will the child find the best role models , social circles , and friends ? 	0

Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good . 	0
Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger . 	0
Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
But it turns out , she ’ s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ’ s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy “ to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ” a laudable goal . 	0
Oh come on . 	0
As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ’ orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
I ’ ll never forget one woman ’ s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ’ t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
Well , that ’ s one solution . 	0
I think I laughed at the time . 	0
I wish I had moved sooner , but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone . 	0
Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used “ the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ” 	0
“ Excellent . ” 	0

We teach our children how to learn , not merely how to pass tests . 	0
My 8yr-old is already enjoying our sessions with basic physics and chemistry textbooks , books which are generally used at the start of secondary school . 	0
@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0
6 ) Children are impressionable . 	0
10 ) What if a child dissents ? 	0
However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
My 10 year old is in a private school . 	0
This is costly . 	0
9 ) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers , one would have to hire ministers . 	0
Should there be separate prayers for Mormons , LDS , Muslims , Catholics , and Cult of Cthulhu adherents ? 	0
NO ! 	0
From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
Everyone . 	0
Each family is unique . 	0
I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ’ t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
Why would a public school , a school that isn ’ t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ’ t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ’ t believe that bringing ‘ prayer back into the schools ’ will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0
With the vast amount of editorials lobbying for prayer to be back in schools I couldn ’ t help but to disagree . 	0
If you think I should say something I ’ m not or take out something I shouldn ’ t say or any other comments . 	0

This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0

The emotion behind her statements threw me off a bit , but since that time I ’ ve been giving this topic a lot of thought , since it is clearly a topic about which many parents are thinking , are feeling strongly , and are looking for direction . 	0

“ Sam ’ s Top Secret Journal : Book One ” takes on issues of bullying and exclusion as Sam and her brother John solve a crime and help a friend escape danger . 	0
The heroine of Sean Adelman ’ s new Nancy Drew-style children ’ s book series is Sam , a middle-grade girl with Down syndrome . 	0
Some say it benefits all students ; others say it ’ s a cost-cutting trick that denies services . 	0
Some say the practice of mainstreaming students with disabilities in regular classrooms is a controversial subject . 	0
“ Friends must learn to accept one another ’ s limitations and flaws and to complement one another ’ s weaknesses by contributing their strengths , ” Adelman wrote . 	0
In a TEACH magazine article about his new book , Adelman says inclusion of students with disabilities benefits entire student bodies by teaching kids about diversity in the real world and helping them develop empathy . 	0
When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
The things Sam does in the book are based on the abilities of Adelman ’ s own daughter , Dev , who also has Down syndrome . 	0
This was promising to see . 	0
Another promising skill I saw was when he was stuck on a word , he remembered he wrote it previously and therefore looked back at the word to help him spell it again . 	0
He wanted all the action to start at the beginning and with all his ideas the characters were being sent in every direction possible . 	0
However , he had no idea how to start the beginning of his narrative and what the structure of a narrative is , with the orientation beginning the narrative and the complication following . 	0
This is quite interesting as it demonstrates that he is still at that level of a kindergarten / yr 1 student , being able to verbally produce a sentence however , not write it down exactly . 	0
From this , even though his structuring was slightly off track he was able to verbally produce some great sentences however , forgot them for when he had to write them down . 	0
I thought I would add this piece in to help develop an understanding of the difficulties one child has and the significant disadvantage he has academically . 	0
As previously mentioned in my last blog ( Weekly reflection 2 ) I was working individually with a child with significant learning difficulties . 	0
What I did notice whilst I was working with him was that at first he had absolutely no idea of what to write and me not knowing the movie did not help either but once I asked him to retell me what happened in the movie and started giving him some ideas he thought of his own and from there had some great ideas . 	0
He spends a lot of time out of class with the special education teachers receiving one on one work but missing out on other important activities . 	0
For me , geometry was a nightmare and there wasn ' t a curriculum that worked for me . 	0
Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise . 	1
Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn ' t ready for the classroom environment , but when they enroll they should be put into the 1st grade ( again unless there is a documented delay ) . 	0
That ' s a good thing . 	0
He is remarkable . 	0
It is the quality of teachers ' training , lessons , and classroom management practices — and not the sex of their students — that determines the quality of learning in their classrooms . 	0
An adequate education is vitally important in a child ' s life . 	0
Despite the debate , federal law supports the option of single-sex education in public schools . 	0
Parents should not be allowed to withold it . 	0
When it comes to medical care , the courts often overrule parents who are irrationally threatening a child ' s life due to mistaken religious beliefs . 	0
That is scary for rest of us . 	0
A primary purpose of public education is to shape good citizens . 	0
In this fast-track world , it may be hard to believe that play is critical for brain development , but it is . 	0
“ Research shows that play actually leads to improved academic skills . 	0
I have a daughter now , and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing , I feel she , like my sister , is well equipped for school ( emotionally , mentally and academically ) , I feel when she starts in September she will thrive . 	0
I would have failed without a doubt ! 	0
I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0
What is this “ spontaneous eruption of religiosity ” that FFRF finds to be so threatening to students at public schools ? 	0
All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0
always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school . 	0
private schools will always be around . 	0
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
if you can ' t teach then someone will take notice . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon . 	0
I also agree God should have never came out of the schools . 	0
if they can ' t provide , you can ' t teach . 	0
If you can afford to send your kids to private schools do . 	1
My son went to Columbus Public Schools , in Columbus , Ohio and they treated him and myself badly . 	0
I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education . 	0
It made no difference . 	0
They didn ' t want my help or my commitment to the school . 	0
I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement . 	0
if you don ' t like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders . 	0
don ' t try to make parents feel guilty about it . 	0
she is academically ahead of the curve , she is a social butterfly ( which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother ) , she didn ' t suffer for me deciding that i was very capable , tyvm , of teaching her myself , and that " socializing " at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers . 	0
it is what it is . 	0
she was allowed to " just be a kid " until she started school at 5 , and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to " just be a kid " . 	0
Having said that , a private education is no guarentee of a job , nor that you will always have that job . . . 	0
I have seen plenty of people being shown the door in the corporate world for being incompetent , lazy . 	0
A few points , the " perceived advantages " were hardly touched on in this article . 	0
I know there are some advantages at private schools , having gone to a woefully basic selective high school . 	1
eg daughter in yr 10 decided not to do a science for yr 11 , i received a call from her academic advisor about this , and how did i feel about the career choices she was shutting the door on . 	0
I really appreciated the call , as it meant someone genuinely cared about her future . 	0
stupid , or getting their hand caught in the till . . . . . the boss does not care where you went to school when it comes to firing for these " crimes " . 	0
I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school , for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with , resources are good , and it is hard to put into words , but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time . 	0
I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
would this happen in a state school ? 	0
I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0
In the non-public school , while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically , he is having behavior problems . 	0
WAKE UP AMERICA , PLEASE ! 	0
Saying a student or a teacher can ' t pray is a OBVIOUS VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ! 	1
" How long will you waiver between two opinions ? " 	0
Either there is Religious Freedom or there is not . 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
Hello , I constantly hear and read the cliches ( no offense ) , " I am not ______ , but I don ' t the ______ should do _______ . " . 	0
It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life . 	0
Well , duh , it is this simple : Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do , think , and say . 	0
Why ? 	0
All or Nothing people , there cannot be middle ground . 	0
In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
In 2013 , the world is decidedly different , and the battles are far less obscure . 	0
Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat " rape culture , " and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development . 	0
Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment , stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder , and so my summers there were a revelation . 	0
Not the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp , members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists , were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing , biking , swimming , and lots of group activities--as leadership development . 	0
I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to , and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm . 	0
The task of female role models and mentors was changing , and the staff was up to the work . 	0
I also discovered what " collaborative leadership " meant , as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic , just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television , movies , and high school . 	0
If summers found me in a land of strong and independent women , my first three teaching jobs ( my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment ) were back in a man ' s world . 	0
I think many of my generation of male teachers , with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution , had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood , and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies ; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys , we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear . 	0
I don ' t know how well it worked , but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution . 	0
Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
In many underresourced schools , it ’ s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ’ s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
And parents have a lot of power . 	0
If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
Why ? 	0
Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
I wouldn ' t send my dog to public schools in Florida . 	1
I rose up to make changes . . . rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt , unsafe , government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system . 	0

This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0
If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it . 	1
I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
More accountability for students and teachers . 	0
Go on Netflix and watch " Waiting for Superman " . 	0
Quite the eye opener . 	0
It ' s not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools . 	0
Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0
Naturally , if a school has the power to select and expel students at will , it ' s easier teaching there . 	0
If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
There is no secret to the rise of private schools . 	0
More respect for students and teachers 3 . 	0
More resources 2 . 	0
I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
Ditto , social justice and pastoral care . 	0
I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die . 	0
We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying " so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . " 	0
At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0
It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ” 	0
Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that “ God ’ s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0
We are living witnesses that truly “ the Lord does not hold such a nation guiltless . ” 	0

They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college , universities and at work . 	0
It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0
The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year . 	0
Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0
Problems in the schools systems are not the parents fault , it ' s the systems fault . 	0
Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor . 	0
The answer is probably most . 	0
And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit . 	0
That ' s a foolish idea . 	0
Kids have too much homework ; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep . 	0
I bothers me that Allison Benedikt ( I suppose and intelligent woman ) makes the statement and it further bothers me that this article says her argument is " compelling . " 	0

At supper that evening I asked Billy to say the blessings . 	0
The principal said it would be done right away . 	0
You ’ d better believe I was at the principal ’ s office at eight o ’ clock the next morning . 	0
He slipped out of his chair , sat cross-legged , closed his eyes , raised his hand palms up in the air and began to hum . 	0
‘ I don ’ t really know much about these Transcendental Meditationists , but I would feel a lot more comfortable If you could move Billy to a room where the teacher practices an older , more established religion . 	0

That afternoon I met Billy as soon as he walked in the door after school . 	0
But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here . 	0
But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
It all depends on the person . 	0
I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of “ socialization ” as a reason not to homeschool , I ’ m going to erupt . 	0
So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
That ’ s easy . 	0
Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
Somebody needs to . 	0
I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ’ t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
Reality sunk in . 	0
We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour . . . i went to rondebosch , sacs / sax ( forgot ) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember model c or private school is your best bet ! 	1
Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics . . . everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby 	0
Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life , I see why not . 	1
So the question is … should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom ? 	1
I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level , he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically . 	0
He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom . 	0
He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers . 	0
If this child was to be in a special school / support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class . 	0
Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
It isn ’ t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
If you can ’ t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
It ’ s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
And that ’ s what your goal should be : parenting your child ’ s inner world . 	0
But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ’ t ) , sports don ’ t outweigh what ’ s best for your child ’ s heart . 	0
I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
For a critical mass families and kids , some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties , aspirations , and capacities . 	0
Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$ ! 	0
I ' m talking black , white , brown , asian , oriental , you name it they ' ve got it . 	0
So you won ' t get your undies in a bunch , the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum . 	0
That ' s unheard of in public schools . 	0
We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people . 	0
No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems . 	0
With a plethora of drugs and gang problems , public schools are the LAST place I would send my child ! 	1
Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
Please don ’ t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions . 	0
I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
I was standing on the front steps of the school when the final bell rang . 	0
“ Well ? ” 	0
I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0

There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
5 . ) 	0
I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
So those are my main points . 	0
I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
This is the reality of public education today . 	0
I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 … . 	0
I didn ’ t debate and didn ’ t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument . 	0
I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious ! 	0

“ Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
That ’ s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on “ redshirting . ” 	0
The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
It isn ’ t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
Including the one my kids attend . 	0
I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
( My husband was not . ) 	0
And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
Wow ! ! ! 	0
If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0

This article was nothing more than union propaganda because we all know how supportive unions are of non-union entities . 	0

He was in 5th grade and his spelling words were the days of the week , and one of four native English speaker in his class . 	0
The teachers from my experience , expect the students to teach themselves , they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends ( other staff ) , take care of personal business etc . Oh and now in Ca . , add the confusion of gender identity to the mix , where 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2% , causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is " I feel like a boy / girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today " and now preteen / teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room / shower any time he wants , even while girls are showering . 	0
I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the ( lack of ) education he was receiving was not up to standard . 	0
She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
My future grandchildren will not go to public school . 	1
And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence . 	0
Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence . 	0
Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
Seriously . 	0
But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
People are always afraid . 	0
Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0

He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0

In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
Do you have a better idea ? 	0
Use the comment field below to voice your opinion . 	0
My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
You will never , ever regret it . 	0
Nor will your child . 	0
If you can ’ t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
But please , consider doing something . 	0
Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0

Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0

This is not about real " choice " . 	0
When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0

Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
This is NOT true . 	0
Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
Again , do the research . 	0
Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
But … 	0
The reality is students with special needs are a small percentage of the population and cannot drive a fundamental shift in education . 	0
Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ’ ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
It drives me nuts . 	0
Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
Not a problem . 	0
I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
Same sex education works best for males . 	0
Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
How many parents are there have their kids in public schools that wish the school system was different . 	0
I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
The public school was a joke . 	1
So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
Oh , but she ’ s gifted ? 	0
This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
I went K–12 to a terrible public school . 	0
Well , then , she ’ ll really be fine . 	0
You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ’ t need it . 	0
I understand . 	0
She will have support at home ( that ’ s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying , and failing a lot of other things too . 	0
I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
There wasn ’ t even soccer . 	0
When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0
As a parent that sent her son to private schools , I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment . 	0
His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
So in some cases there ' s a safety issue . 	0

So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0
While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
That ' s my personal opinion . 	0
its gone . 	0
I don ' t think they should allow it personally in public school unless a child is tested delayed . 	1
She was fine , she ' s in 2nd now and fine and every few months the difference between her and her peers gets smaller and smaller and smaller . 	0
Until Poof ! 	0
I think there will be a backlash about this . 	0
I have a child who I sent to KG at age 4 , our cutoffs are December 1 . 	0
If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0
His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work . 	0
He met the cutoff to start at 4yo and we sent him . 	0
HIPPO ODS will never be socially en par with his peers , but was reading and writing and adding by 4yo . 	0

They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
I see no issue here . 	0
Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
This is just silliness . 	0
For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1
In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ’ s best for students with disabilities . 	0
The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
Whew ! 	0
She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
Just know He will judge the wicked . 	0
Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0

Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan ’ s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0

All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls . 	0
The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they need , Clayton wrote . 	0
one hour out of 48 is not alot . 	0
ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok . i go to a private catholic school and at school we pray three times it not that much and only takes up like 5 minutes total for the whole day 	1
first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness . 	0
and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour . 	0
A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late " substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade , and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores . 	0
He instills fear into people . 	0
All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that . 	0
You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0
Look at it this way . 	0
How many home educated children do you hear of that have ASBO ’ s ? 	0
How many home educated children to you hear of committing suicide ? 	0
@ calminthestorm . 	0
I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers — virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business ’ disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
In the case of education , it ’ s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0
Nor was I surprised that the news media has ignored the Lubienski book . 	0
Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
What do you think ? 	0
Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ’ s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ’ t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0
Right now , all citizens of the U . S . pay taxes to maintain their local schools . 	0
According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0
Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home , or not socially or academically adept . 	0
" We find that between 4 and 5 . 5 percent of children delay kindergarten , a lower number than typically reported … 	0
A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0
It ' s a phenomenon known as redshirting . 	0
More parents are putting off a child ' s kindergarten entry so he or she will be a little older than the classmates . 	0
" It has always been in practice , but it has gotten more attention recently and people are talking more about it , " said Vela , a mother of three and a preschool teacher for 25 years . 	0
" The reasons parents choose to redshirt their child vary , depending on the child ' s emotional , social and academic readiness to join school , " Dana Vela , president of Sunrise Preschools , in Arizona , said in an interview with ABCNews . com . 	0

The real world is not segregated , nor are universities . 	0
I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
Why can ' t we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services ? 	0
Thankfully , the teacher situation seems to have stabilized . 	0
Yet , they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems . 	0
The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0
you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0
teachers claim they are not paid enough . 	0
if that means sending them to private school , then so be it . 	0
no difference in home schooling . 	0
you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
you had to intern somewhere ? 	0

A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0
I am the only quiet person in this loud family . 	0
I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0

( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0

A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts on the impact of Title IX beyond collegiate athletics and last week my colleague , Markus Gerke , wrote brilliantly about the myth of the boy crisis in education . 	0

We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
Everyone , all in . 	0
( By the way : Banning private schools isn ’ t the answer . 	0
None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
I believe in public education , but my district school really isn ’ t good ! 	0
you might say . 	0
We are also far from rich . 	0

There , I said it . 	0
Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0

No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
Here ’ s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
Perhaps this outcome isn ’ t surprising . 	0
Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
Got that ? 	0
Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
I asked Billy as we walked towards the car . 	0
Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1

We tried it . 	0
Pulled one of our kids out of a private school into the local public school . 	0
Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
“ Fine . ” 	0
“ Did many kids go out into the hallway ? ” 	0
Of course , Margaret and I explained to him no matter what the other kids did , he was going to stay in the classroom and participate . 	0
After the first day of school , I asked him , “ How did the prayer time go ? ” 	0
Naturally , we were all excited by the school board action . 	0
We hoped someone would sue us so we could go all the way to the supreme court and get the old devil-inspired ruling reversed . 	0
Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0
Finally , the school board approved a plan of teacher-led prayer with the children participating at their own option . 	0
As always there were honourable exceptions . 	0
About 80% of the time you could pick the private school repeats , who immediately asked ' what ' s the answer ? ' rather than ' how can we work it out ? ' 	0
Our kids attended state schools and excelled , one to doctoral level . 	0
Thanks for an entertaining , very timely infomercial for conservative state governments . 	0
SV , that reflects my personal experience of teaching matriculation courses in TAFE . 	0
They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids . . . and research indicates that coddled , spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears . . . . 	0
Sometimes some of us are trying to make the world a better place starting with our children . 	0
she is obviously a liberal . 	0
only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
people with money give more . 	0
simple as that . 	0
you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
I credit my earlier classroom experiences for my chutzpah . 	0
But being a social scientist I can ' t help but look to the literature ( incidentally , the well-researched footnotes are one of Lean In ' s strongest features , and worth a read ) , and that ' s when the picture becomes more complicated . 	0
At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
Some of my classes were coed . 	0
The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0
Sadly , my college chose to go co-ed years ago . 	0
It left a hole in my heart . 	0
1 ) There ' s no reason to suspect it matters . 	0
Most people who send their children to private schools would prefer to save the money and go public . . . if only that system could provide a first class education . 	0
Women spoke . 	0
Assertively . 	0
I am a scientist and I believe in data over anecdote , yet I experienced the beneficial effects of single-sex education myself . 	0
After co-ed public high school and a freshman year at a co-ed university , I transferred to a women ' s college and the difference was astonishing . 	0
When I went to law school , and later to grad school , I could always pick out the women who attended women ' s colleges . 	0
We all could . 	0
Being intellectual and smart was cool . 	0
Speaking up was cool . 	0
My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator . 	0
Prayer , or more specifically , the annual See You at the Pole . 	0
And I do mean facts : Homeschooled children significantly outperform children educated in public school systems in reading , language , math , science and social studies . 	0
So I guess in that respect it doesn ' t really matter . 	0
Can be either I ' ve seen it go both ways ! 	0
Interestingly the boys I know from single sex schools seem more against it than the girls and they do feel they were socially hampered a bit . 	0
I still think co-ed is more natural though . 	1
Ultimately , we as a society lose . 	0
Our society just isn ' t gear for that . 	0
" I have studied how children learn and develop and have been in the field of early care and education for more than 30 years . 	0
CNN should not publish such nonsense . 	0
" This is just plain wrong . 	0
" Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade . 	0
So , if you studied this ( evidently , without much success ) , why so you resort to anecdotal information ? 	0
The greatest part of my knowledge comes from my own children . . " 	0
I give up other things to do that . 	0
I work hard and the American way allows me to make those choices . 	0
I just pulled my child out of public school because of the incompetent teachers there . 	0
I have always been involved in my children ' s education in the public school . 	0
I am a teacher myself and I give 100% of me everyday to my students but unfortunately where my kids go to school they don ' t . 	0
I am thank-ful I could afford to send them to a private school . 	0
And that ' s what scares these selfish people that want to take away people ' s freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do ! 	0
After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0
And the public school doesn ' t provide anything for those kids , but the system still takes their money . 	0
I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0
public education is for the most part terrible , and it ' s too bad that our government had to step in and ruin what was working ! ! 	1
maybe someday we ' ll elect official ' s that give the people what they really want , instead of slamming they ' re own agenda ' s down our throat ! ! ! 	0

I don ' t agree with overprotectiveness but I do agree with parents doing their jobs . 	0
Being parents . 	0
" To control the future requires the control of education and of the child . 	0
Hence , for Christians to tolerate statist education , or to allow their children to be trained thereby , means to renounce power in society , to renounce their children , and to deny Christ ' s Lordship over all of life . ” 	0
My other friend is super-mega smart and got a fantastic education . 	0
She ended up going to be a Missionary / English teacher . 	0
Her sister , in college now , and she ' s such a sweet person . 	0
None of my friends or siblings are messed up , because they have been taught well . 	0
In some schools , mainstreaming of students with disabilities is used only for those classes in which the child has ability to keep up with peers , according to SEA . 	0
Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won ' t be a bad person . 	0
and for the author of this article to call it compelling is sad . 	0
Your argument is stupid . 	0
If millions of frustrated parents cannot change the system , what makes you think a few others can . 	0
The self consciousness hinders students from asking questions in class , and therefore students get more frustrated by not understanding the material . 	0
There is an event happening at schools all across the country later this month that , according to Freedom From Religion Foundation ( “ FFRF ” ) , people need to be warned about . 	0
Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
Our government is based upon hate . 	0
Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
The best education is the only route to go ; and it isn ' t in a public school system . 	1
Knowledge is the only thing that will save you . 	0
Knowledge is power . 	0
My children and I all went to public schools . 	0
The 2006 move was designed to give parents and school districts greater flexibility in selecting an environment best for individual students . 	0
To send to an immoral government run pig farm ? 	0
Absolutely stupid person , why do we have children ? 	0
No but to give to our children all the best that we as parents can ! 	0
I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting / stabbing . 	0
I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums . 	0
Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ’ s unions or political correctness . 	0
Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ’ s educational needs . 	0
OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
We can test a child academically but we can never test their emotional readiness . 	0
They sometimes are not ready to leave home at the age of five and the separation anxiety will impact them for a long time . 	0
Usually not . 	0
The public school classroom may be one of the few . 	0
No . 	0
Social outings ? 	0
No . 	0
Church ? 	0
Where else in life do we spend such a large amount of time with only a group of people all the same age ? 	0
In the workforce ? 	0
Wouldn ’ t this be considered social opportunities ? 	0
Think about kids in the public school classroom spending six to seven hours of their day with a group of only their same-aged peers . 	0
Why wouldn ' t they ? 	0
You betcha I would have . 	1
There will be reprecusions for the choices that have been made without God . 	0
I think private schools are great and hope a lot more come about . 	1
But do remember – God is not mocked . 	0
Every knee shall bow , and every tongue will confess the Jesus Christ is Lord . 	0
This country in now the most liberal county , we allow everything to go . 	0
After all that God has done to make this the richest land ever , this is how we show our thanks . 	0
I too believed that out nation is under a great fall due taking prayer out of schools and attempting to take God out of everything we do . 	0
Our country has lost morales and respect for God . 	0
I am not an education policy wonk : I ’ m just judgmental . 	0
So , pretty bad . 	0
Not bad like murderer bad—but bad like ruining-one-of-our-nation ’ s-most-essential-institutions-in-order-to-get-what ’ s-best-for-your-kid bad . 	0
You are a bad person if you send your children to private school . 	1
Your children and grandchildren might get mediocre educations in the meantime , but it will be worth it , for the eventual common good . 	0
It could take generations . 	0
This would not happen immediately . 	0
But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ’ t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
Then , in first grade , we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide . 	0
He made academic gains and seemed very happy . 	0
The first year was great . 	0
So he ended up in a segregated , structured special ed . classroom . 	0
We didn ' t know the questions to ask , period . 	0
First of all , we didn ' t know he had a right to inclusion . 	0
In real life , it hasn ' t worked so well for my son . 	0
In theory , I absolutely support inclusion . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
He didn ' t have any friends among the peers without disabilities . 	0
By the second semester , it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed . classes . 	0
We can take care of that ourselves at home and at church , thank you very much . 	0
I don ’ t need schools or anybody else teaching my son about religion . 	1
I plan to be at that board meeting . 	0
I ’ ve given Billy very definite instructions that at prayer time each day he ’ s to go out into the hallway . 	0
I ’ LL take it all the way to the Supreme Court if I have to . 	0
If they don ’ t do something about this situation , I ’ LL sue . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
His mum doesn ' t send him to school because she worries he ' ll get bullied . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
Why ? 	0
By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
Boys were beastly enough without the distraction of girls , and the educational needs of girls were thought to diverge from those of boys even before puberty brought its complications . 	0
Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate " Boys " and " Girls " entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . 	0
Then followed a couple of years of all-male university , until we were happily rolled over by the tidal wave of vintage 1970 coeducation , leaving the president to figure out how to keep his promise that we ' d produce " a thousand male leaders " every year ; so was born the cramped room students call a " forced triple . " 	0
As at many all-male institutions , the arrival of women didn ' t make a huge dent in the culture right away , and so it when I found myself the lone male at a girls ' summer camp ( the maintenance guy , often reeking slightly of rotting garbage ) I experienced culture shock . 	0
Honestly ? 	0
How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
I went to both , public and private . 	0
The essential difference were the students . 	0
And it makes all the difference . 	0
How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
No more will she ever go to a public school again . 	1
My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education , attend mass daily , be safe , and learn . 	0
And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her . 	0
In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade . 	0
This will be her second year . 	0
Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means . 	0
I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , “ The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ” 	0
Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
I know one " home-educated " kid . 	0
I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
Also remember that there ’ s more to education than what ’ s taught . 	0
Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
I ' m not a fan of the nanny state , but I can see why the government is doing this . 	0
Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
Of course not . 	0
The trouble is , home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff . 	0
In fact it ’ s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
Let ’ s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
Being aware of your child ’ s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ’ s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
IHow many young people have the intelligence , drive and courage to do for themselves what this young man did ? 	0
I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
It was the best investment I had made . 	0
As far as I can tell , the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you ' d get in school . 	0
Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
But much of it is mythology . 	0
Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child ’ s reading level . 	0
Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
” See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children ’ s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first day—not delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . ” 	0
only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
I mean why not ? 	0
I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
I didn ' t . 	0
Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
I had no idea . 	0
Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
I don ' t know . 	0
It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‘ if prayer should be in schools ’ debate , because it ’ s a worthless cause . 	0
Instead , let ’ s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
You don ’ t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ’ t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
Done ! 	0
Prayer that doesn ’ t change the one praying isn ’ t prayer either . 	0
When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ’ s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn ’ t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0

There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
If a teenager told doctors , " I want this treatment " and the parents refused to give consent , what would a court do ? 	0
Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0

The Special Education Advisor blog defines mainstreaming as “ selective placement of special education students in one or more ‘ regular ’ education classes . ” 	0
You know who else wants those things ? 	0
Philosophies and policies for carrying out the law vary , though . 	0
The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they ' re urging citizens to vote yes . . . . even though they just approved $150 , 000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field . 	0
Inclusion , the philosophy Adelman prefers , is defined by SEA as “ the commitment to educate each child , to the maximum extent appropriate , in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend . ” 	0
The law requires that children with disabilities be educated with children who are not disabled to the extent that is appropriate . 	0
As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools 	0
That is why I am doing this , because of one of my classes . 	0
Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do . . . you shoulkd post some things for debate teams . 	1
If you want you children to get a good education , private is the only way to do it ! 	1
That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes . 	0
And no I don ' t feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget . 	0
The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
Although IDEA became law more than two decades ago , its implementation remains spotty . 	0
The government , teachers unions and political correctness has killed them . 	0
He points out that , “ the World Court , for example , presumably the new fountain of justice , or a prototype of the socialist dream of world government , has no provision for ’ taking the name of God ’ – no oath . ” 	0
I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others , but mainstream is not the way . 	1
I have been advised to put my money in private schools , or else save it for attorneys later . 	0
Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable – and what I ’ m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
Isn ’ t that the fear of parents ? 	0
And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
People generally do this because they want what is best for their children . 	0
For example , religion is a good thing . . . the public school does not believe in that . . . . . 	0
Lady , you need to get your head out of your *ss . 	0
There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school , and guess what , they are none of your business but here are a few . 	1
The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child ' s education . 	0
By the way , last time I checked , we are not in Cuba . 	0
Christmas is usually referred to as the ' Winter Festival . ' 	0
Additionally , I don ' t want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap . 	0
What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school . 	0
She always felt she could succeed and did . 	0
We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in , so keeping her mind busy wasn ' t a problem . 	0
She is now a lawyer , who graduated in 2011 , president of the law school bar association , hired right out of school and doing very well . 	0
We kept our middle child back one year . 	0
She turned 5 in early September , but our thought was emotionally , she wasn ' t ready , so she started at 6 . 	0
I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked " You ' re an engineer , like on a train ? " and " How do I hook this to the computer ? " 	0
( speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class , with film ) 	0
I am a product of private school vs the rather run down public school around the corner from where I grew up . 	0
I later worked in an after school science program in public schools . 	0
I can attest , that if I went to these schools , I would not have been there to test these kids after school . 	0
The only way my parents could have fixed it , as the author claims would have happened , is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves . 	0
On the other side Homechoolers , depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled , have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people , though usually smaller thatn the public school , but have the freedom of doing things togethermore often , Time schedules are more flexible and if you really wanted to you could skip a whole day of school in the middle of the wek just to hand out eith people . 	0
This point may actually lead to a superiorty in certain areas on one side or the other 	0
Where you could study the World in Highschool , , I might spend two years just to get an overview of the United States History in college . 	0
Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0
Challenge school committees to reconsider whether standardized testing in the lower elementary grades is a good idea . 	0
When my daughter has a 4 year window in HS to succeed or not to succeed , I don ' t have time to drive the change that typically take years . 	0
That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it . 	0
I don ' t disagree the author about the parents driving change but guess what ? 	0
grades say " the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can ' t concentrate / work . 	0
And the teachers can ' t do anything about it . " 	0
I have students in both private and public schools . 	0

Every knee will bow and toung confess that JESUS is LORD . 	0
Try reading the BIBLE and see what it says . 	0
Just because you don ’ t believe something doesn ’ t mean it doesn ’ t exist . 	0
Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control . 	0
The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation . 	0
Wow anyone who does not believe prayer should be in school has not studied history . 	0
This lady is something else . 	0
First of all let me say , my children attend a private school . 	0
Our district schools are less than admirable . 	0
Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0
I ' m still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district . . . whether I agree with it or not ! 	0
Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year . 	0
While the 60 Minutes piece suggested that some parents hold children back from kindergarten to gain competitive advantages , Dr . Densmore pointed out that many parents are responding to the shift in what kindergarten is . 	0
Really ? 	0
It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0
Thank you for your time . 	0

There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0
I don ' t think we should pretend it couldn ' t happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is , in itself , highly damaging . 	0
