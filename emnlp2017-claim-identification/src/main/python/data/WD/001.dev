The teachers from my experience , expect the students to teach themselves , they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends ( other staff ) , take care of personal business etc . Oh and now in Ca . , add the confusion of gender identity to the mix , where 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2% , causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is " I feel like a boy / girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today " and now preteen / teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room / shower any time he wants , even while girls are showering . 	0

In a private school , a student being expelled or suspended is not just one student out the door , its the rest of that students schooling life fees gone . 	0
Whereas in a public school , its just the student gone . 	0
Student who study in the private sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more than anyone would in a public school . 	0
And its all because of the money . 	0

one hour out of 48 is not alot . 	0
ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok . i go to a private catholic school and at school we pray three times it not that much and only takes up like 5 minutes total for the whole day 	1
first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness . 	0
and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour . 	0
Also , while academic standards were high , it was very much a ' survival of the fittest ' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter . 	0

After the first day of school , I asked him , “ How did the prayer time go ? ” 	0
Naturally , we were all excited by the school board action . 	0
We hoped someone would sue us so we could go all the way to the supreme court and get the old devil-inspired ruling reversed . 	0
Finally , the school board approved a plan of teacher-led prayer with the children participating at their own option . 	0
