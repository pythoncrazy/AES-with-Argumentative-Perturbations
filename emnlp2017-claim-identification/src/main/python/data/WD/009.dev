Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds . 	0
If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0
This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies . 	0
It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0

I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
She is a total marxist moron . 	0
How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
A new , and sound , study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive . 	0
So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
My In our state , we have one of the youngest start ages ( 5 by Dec 31st ) . 	0
Private schools , producing more 1-dimensional bigots with an overblown sense of self-entitlement than any other education option . . . #Rex , Of which most of them become either lawyers or politicians . 	0
Ms . Wong , Benedikt ' s reason is in no-way-shape-or-from compelling . 	0

While I ' m all for public schools ; both our kids attend . 	1
American parents have never given up their right to find the best solution for their child nor should they . 	0
In the grey world , it ' s perfectly possible to believe-in and support public school but choose a private school for your student . 	0
He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
My daughter goes to an excellent public school in Durbs and their is nothing lacking in the quality of their education . 	0
In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
It all depends on the public school . 	0
Then again the truth cannot be said for our neighbouring Maccassar . 	0
Also living in Somerset West , our ( former white ) public schools continue to outperform our private schools . 	0
What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
One of my now close friends told me long after we met that when she initially saw my name and profession on our playgroup roster , she thought , “ oh great . ” 	0
Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0
The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home , by parents . 	0
Two years ago I was at a cocktail party and making friendly conversation with a group of women . 	0
This is one hot topic . 	0
We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
This distinction is crucial . 	0
Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
What will I do for Leo ? 	0
Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
the teachers were not sufficiently trained to deal with him , we were constantly called to the school to sort it out ( when tbh we had no idea how either ! ) he was suspended more times than i remember and was only on half days ! 	0
forgot to add , my son was very disruptive and dangerous alot of the time in mainstream , because he couldn ' t cope . 	0
the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people ' s attitudes . . . it doesn ' t in my experience . . . they only did it to save money 	0
( which i ' ve later discovered is actually illegal ) . . . so no , it wasn ' t fair on the other kids . . . not fair on him either . 	0
I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year , where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention . 	0
This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0
Prayer is a frontal attack on the notion that mankind is in autonomous control of his own destiny and an insult to those who believe that friends , possessions , or power can bring meaning or joy . 	0
The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels . 	0
The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues . 	0
I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids . 	0
I held her back . 	0
My daughter was born on the cut off date . 	0
There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year ( March ) are more successful in life due to the age gap . 	0
The emotion behind her statements threw me off a bit , but since that time I ’ ve been giving this topic a lot of thought , since it is clearly a topic about which many parents are thinking , are feeling strongly , and are looking for direction . 	0
I want to know when you are going to send your son to kindergarten ! ” 	0
When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
A primary purpose of public education is to shape good citizens . 	0
I have a daughter now , and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing , I feel she , like my sister , is well equipped for school ( emotionally , mentally and academically ) , I feel when she starts in September she will thrive . 	0
I would have failed without a doubt ! 	0
I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
Had I a daughter , I would encourage her to find single-sex schools . 	1
The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
one hour out of 48 is not alot . 	0
ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok . i go to a private catholic school and at school we pray three times it not that much and only takes up like 5 minutes total for the whole day 	1
first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness . 	0
and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour . 	0
How many home educated children do you hear of that have ASBO ’ s ? 	0
How many home educated children to you hear of committing suicide ? 	0
@ calminthestorm . 	0
I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
Sadly , my college chose to go co-ed years ago . 	0
It left a hole in my heart . 	0
Women spoke . 	0

I am a scientist and I believe in data over anecdote , yet I experienced the beneficial effects of single-sex education myself . 	0
After co-ed public high school and a freshman year at a co-ed university , I transferred to a women ' s college and the difference was astonishing . 	0
When I went to law school , and later to grad school , I could always pick out the women who attended women ' s colleges . 	0
We all could . 	0
Being intellectual and smart was cool . 	0
Speaking up was cool . 	0
Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
Our government is based upon hate . 	0
Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
The best education is the only route to go ; and it isn ' t in a public school system . 	1
Knowledge is the only thing that will save you . 	0
Knowledge is power . 	0
I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
People generally do this because they want what is best for their children . 	0
For example , religion is a good thing . . . the public school does not believe in that . . . . . 	0
Lady , you need to get your head out of your *ss . 	0
There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school , and guess what , they are none of your business but here are a few . 	1
The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child ' s education . 	0
By the way , last time I checked , we are not in Cuba . 	0
Christmas is usually referred to as the ' Winter Festival . ' 	0
Additionally , I don ' t want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap . 	0
