On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0
Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0
But if prayer really works , then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God ’ s existence or His sovereignty over this world . 	0
Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
I would look at the subjects on offer . 	0
I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
I mean , c ’ mon ! 	0
How pathetic . 	0
Are we so weak minded ? 	0
Wow , here we go again . 	0
Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
( I am certainly not the first to ask this question . ) 	0
Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0
This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0

School can be very bad for you . 	1
For some people it can be a catastophic experience from which they never recover . 	0
To claim otherwise is rank ignorance . 	0
The racialized question of separate but equal in education was answered by Brown v . 	0
It is heartbreaking . 	0
It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the “ least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ” 	0
That means adults engaging with children during play to help them develop negotiation skills or to share complex ideas . 	0
One way parents can help prepare their children is to ensure that there is adequate facilitated play in preschool . 	0
Gone are the days when kindergarten teachers hold up a letter and ask the class to name it . 	0

I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0

I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
And it is the cornerstone of a child ’ s well-being , ” Densmore told me . 	0
The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
No matter when your child starts kindergarten , it ’ s a new beginning for him or her—and for you . 	0
Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
I went to public schools , I thrived in public schools - my mom MADE me go to public schools . 	0
I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families . 	0
All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn : homemaking skills " . 	0
One of the girls , who has not been taught for two years , could be Josh Powell ' s twin . 	0
She is intelligent and desperate to learn , but her parents won ' t allow it . 	0
Thank you for bringing this tragedy to light . 	0
I am a Christian , an educator , a student and a parent and I have seen too many children like the Powells . 	0
As an admissions officer , we had applicants whose " record keeping " consisted of sending boxes full of paper for our office to review as part of the application . 	0
If their students did get an interview , which was rare , they didn ' t have the social skills to survive the first round . 	0
That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0

And if you want to know how much our children are at risk in terms of peer relationships , the media and more -- and how active parenting must be in our day -- please get hold of “ The Under Protective Parent ” series . 	0
Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
It ’ s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
It ’ s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
It ’ s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0
A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as “ If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ” 	0
Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

Dr . Densmore doesn ’ t believe that holding kids back from kindergarten entry is the total solution . 	0
I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled “ Parents , Sports and Church . ” 	0
All I would add to its words would be that as someone who played competitive sports himself at almost every level , and saw my homeschooled kids engage them at almost every level as well , it ’ s a red herring . 	0
And for those men who say , “ What about sports ? ” 	0
Others may feel they are not qualified or temperamentally suited to the task . 	0

If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then FFRF would not find it “ unfortunate ” that students are encouraged to “ reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ’ s love and forgiveness . ” 	0
If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
The theme of this year ’ s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0
But , of course . 	0
These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0
To hell with everyone else . 	0
As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
Here is my experience . 	0
There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1
Board of Education in 1954 . 	0
Adelman , an orthopedic surgeon in Seattle , is an advocate for inclusion of special education students in regular classrooms — a practice often called mainstreaming . 	0
I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0
To help these students , we have prepared a letter explaining students ’ well-established legal right to engage in prayer and worship at See You at the Pole and to promote the event at school . 	0

Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
But that ’ s not what drives this for me . 	0
And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
Homeschooled children ’ s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ’ household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
Homeschooled children perform better overall in college — from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ’ s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
So what is the threat ? 	0
On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0

“ Friends must learn to accept one another ’ s limitations and flaws and to complement one another ’ s weaknesses by contributing their strengths , ” Adelman wrote . 	0
In a TEACH magazine article about his new book , Adelman says inclusion of students with disabilities benefits entire student bodies by teaching kids about diversity in the real world and helping them develop empathy . 	0

Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0
What is this “ spontaneous eruption of religiosity ” that FFRF finds to be so threatening to students at public schools ? 	0
I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0

It all depends on the person . 	0
I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of “ socialization ” as a reason not to homeschool , I ’ m going to erupt . 	0
So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
That ’ s easy . 	0
Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
Somebody needs to . 	0
I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ’ t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
It isn ’ t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
If you can ’ t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
It ’ s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
And that ’ s what your goal should be : parenting your child ’ s inner world . 	0
But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ’ t ) , sports don ’ t outweigh what ’ s best for your child ’ s heart . 	0
I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0

We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0

Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1

Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
Wow ! ! ! 	0
If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
Do you have a better idea ? 	0

You will never , ever regret it . 	0

If you can ’ t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
But please , consider doing something . 	0
Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0

Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ’ ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0
As a parent that sent her son to private schools , I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment . 	0

So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
I ' m good with that . 	1
They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
I see no issue here . 	0
Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
This is just silliness . 	0
For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ’ s best for students with disabilities . 	0
The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they need , Clayton wrote . 	0
Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
What do you think ? 	0
Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ’ s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ’ t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0
Right now , all citizens of the U . S . pay taxes to maintain their local schools . 	0
Social education is important , alongside academics . 	0
The real world is not segregated , nor are universities . 	0
I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0
Here are the facts . 	0
A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts on the impact of Title IX beyond collegiate athletics and last week my colleague , Markus Gerke , wrote brilliantly about the myth of the boy crisis in education . 	0
In this post I will illustrate how Title IX proponents and believers in the boy crisis myth have come to clash over the topic of single-sex education . 	0
There , I said it . 	0
Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0
Prayer , or more specifically , the annual See You at the Pole . 	0
And I do mean facts : Homeschooled children significantly outperform children educated in public school systems in reading , language , math , science and social studies . 	0
I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0
public education is for the most part terrible , and it ' s too bad that our government had to step in and ruin what was working ! ! 	1
maybe someday we ' ll elect official ' s that give the people what they really want , instead of slamming they ' re own agenda ' s down our throat ! ! ! 	0
In some schools , mainstreaming of students with disabilities is used only for those classes in which the child has ability to keep up with peers , according to SEA . 	0
The self consciousness hinders students from asking questions in class , and therefore students get more frustrated by not understanding the material . 	0
There is an event happening at schools all across the country later this month that , according to Freedom From Religion Foundation ( “ FFRF ” ) , people need to be warned about . 	0
I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums . 	0
Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ’ s unions or political correctness . 	0
Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ’ s educational needs . 	0
The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0

Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
I am a single mother and I make less than most people , and I am sending my child to a private school . 	0

Although IDEA became law more than two decades ago , its implementation remains spotty . 	0
On the other side Homechoolers , depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled , have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people , though usually smaller thatn the public school , but have the freedom of doing things togethermore often , Time schedules are more flexible and if you really wanted to you could skip a whole day of school in the middle of the wek just to hand out eith people . 	0

Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0
