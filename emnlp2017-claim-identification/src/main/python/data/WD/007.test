The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it ' s not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child ' s education in order to keep that failing system going . 	1
What a joke ! ! ! 	0
The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	0
But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to “ initiate this program as designed ” and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ” 	0
As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don ’ t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
My daughter will be 5 in Sept . and she is going to Kindergarten . 	0
She is very excited to go and I don ’ t want her to be behind . 	0
She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc ’ s but not all of them . 	0
She is small for age , but so was I . I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad . 	0
I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability , but I learned to cope . 	0
I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school . 	0
I would say to myself in frustration . 	0
“ This isn ’ t how the world is ! ” 	0
I had to get out , for the sake of my future ! 	0
For four long years , grades six through nine , I attended a rigid , traditional all-girls school . 	0
In 2013 , is single-sex education really the way to go ? 	1
Much more my style . 	0
The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class . 	0
Is we choose to send our children to a different , more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education , So be it . 	0
Being an involved parent with kids in public schools , it doesn ' t matter what policies I try to bring about , or suggestions I bring , or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of , things will NOT change . 	0
The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
I try not to be anti-homeschooling , but . . . it ' s just hard for me . 	1
I really haven ' t met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right , including myself . 	0
I apologize if what I ' m saying offends any of you - that ' s not my intention , I know that there are many homeschooled children who do just fine , but that hasn ' t been my experience . 	0
I have a friend who is 16 , the same age as me . 	0
She has never watched a PG-13 movie . 	0
She has never been on the internet . 	0
She only reads books that her parents pick out for her . 	0
She is not allowed to go outside by herself . 	0
She is not allowed to listen to non-religious music . 	0
She has no idea how people get pregnant . 	0
When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner , then that is where one of the problems lies . 	0
I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0
Jewelry ? 	0
Purse ? 	0
We had a Regina George , Gretchen Wieners , Karen Smith and , of course , a Cady Heron . 	0
Really , it was like Mean Girls ! 	0
Who makes your sneakers ? 	0
Just because we had a strict uniform , by no means did that mean there wasn ’ t competition wardrobe-wise . 	0
I was sent on a wild goose chase from clique to clique . 	0
I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , “ Sorry , are we done here ? ” , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
Research is quite clear about this . 	0
How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
I have only one more problem . 	0
Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
This is where the difference is . 	0
Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible . 	0
My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school . 	0
When we moved to an areas with better schools , we would go to public schools or magnet schools . 	0
We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible . 	0
Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
Why ? 	0
My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0
When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests . 	0
And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
This is only a " compelling " argument to the MSNBC boobs who wrote this . 	0
A new , and sound , study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive . 	0
So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs . 	0
Private schools get students ready for collage and they are given lots of attention . 	0

Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0
Having spent middle school – those really developmental years , around very few boys – talking to them became a major cause of stress . 	0
I clammed up and couldn ’ t put a sentence together . 	0
The cattiness , hierarchy and estrogen rages became a whole other issue . 	0
The cliques and gossip were unbearable . 	0
I love my guy friends ; they have made me a die-hard Lakers fan , and I appreciate them just as much as my closest girlfriends . 	0
Everyone needs a mix in their close-knit friend group . 	0
A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools – those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
If you come out on the other side deficient , it ’ s hard to make up for that . 	0
I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked " first " . 	0
Others may differ , but I always think , isn ’ t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
My view on the subject is no . 	1
I was fortunately able to transfer to a progressive , co-ed , non-uniformed art school . 	0
Unless I was planning on going to an all-women ’ s college and then a convent , I felt like I was going to be unprepared for life if I stayed one second longer . 	0

GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
Lets see here . 	0
Hmmm . . . . 	0
After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0
Redshirting a trend ? 	0
This is insane ! 	0
The Liberal Democrats , Black Racists , Ignorant Civil Rights nuts , Atheist , and the ACLU have made our Public School System a disgrace to education . 	0
Not in Public Schools . 	0
One thing is for sure . 	0
What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
One of my now close friends told me long after we met that when she initially saw my name and profession on our playgroup roster , she thought , “ oh great . ” 	0
Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0
The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
Two years ago I was at a cocktail party and making friendly conversation with a group of women . 	0
This is one hot topic . 	0
Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus , or drop them off at a Public School . 	0
When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
Academics ? 	0
But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
“ It ’ s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
This is a sticky subject . 	0
Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
Wow . 	0
This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
What will I do for Leo ? 	0
Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
They just don ' t get it . 	0
They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
But it turns out , she ’ s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ’ s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy “ to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ” a laudable goal . 	0
As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ’ orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
I ’ ll never forget one woman ’ s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ’ t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
Well , that ’ s one solution . 	0
I think I laughed at the time . 	0
Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used “ the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ” 	0
Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year , where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention . 	0
This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0
Kids are indoctrinated not educated in Public Schools . 	0
The emotion behind her statements threw me off a bit , but since that time I ’ ve been giving this topic a lot of thought , since it is clearly a topic about which many parents are thinking , are feeling strongly , and are looking for direction . 	0
I want to know when you are going to send your son to kindergarten ! ” 	0
When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise . 	1
Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn ' t ready for the classroom environment , but when they enroll they should be put into the 1st grade ( again unless there is a documented delay ) . 	0
He is remarkable . 	0
An adequate education is vitally important in a child ' s life . 	0
Parents should not be allowed to withold it . 	0
Unfortunately , as Josh Powell ' s experience shows , sometimes even parents who want to do the best they can for their children may not succeed . 	0
When it comes to medical care , the courts often overrule parents who are irrationally threatening a child ' s life due to mistaken religious beliefs . 	0
Though the state must respect a parent ' s right to offer an education consistent with their religious beliefs , sometimes maybe a parent needs to respect the expertise of others when it comes to determining what makes a quality education . 	0
If you ’ re a loving parent , the last thing you want to do is create a situation where your children are limited or hindered . ” 	0
Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : “ A good education is not an option . 	0
In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
Why ? 	0
Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
It ’ s essential . 	0
You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
So now our kids are exposed to more bad teaching . 	0
Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach , we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system . 	0
We have no regrets as he is now trying to " fix " the problem from the inside by teaching in public schools . 	0
My son benefited from sacrifice that affected me and the wife into our retirement . 	0
You get a bad car to drive and no guarantee that you have helped the company . 	0
Putting our children into a bad system to improve it is like buying a bad car from a company that is in trouble for it ' s quality problems . 	0
NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years . 	0
YES we need to improve the public system . 	0
Miss Benidikt makes the statement that " you want the best for your child but your child doesn ' t need it " . 	0
The competition that private schools give to public will only improve the latter . 	0
I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 … . 	0
I didn ’ t debate and didn ’ t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument . 	0
I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious ! 	0

The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
my granddaughter just graduated from public school with a 4 . 	0
grade average . 	0
she asked me what time it was once and I " quarter after two " she had no idea what that meant . 	0
she thinks 26% for a credit card is a good deal , and had no idea what nuclear energy is she has no idea of how the federal government works or even whos in it . ask her where electricity comes from and she points to the wall . 	0
shes not stupid shes just not educated if I had the money I would have sent her to a private school in a heartbeat 	1
All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
But I didn ' t say it . 	0
Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
The public school was a joke . 	1
When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0
Olivia . 	0
My friend Olivia is as sweet as can be . 	0
Which uniform style are YOU wearing ? 	0
Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan ’ s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0
EVERYONE had the same one ! 	0
All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls . 	0
There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
Here ’ s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
Perhaps this outcome isn ’ t surprising . 	0
Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
Got that ? 	0
Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
Some parents feel that public schools will contradict the religious values they are attempting to teach their kids . 	0
Sometimes local public schools are themselves doing a poor job of educating students . 	0
I don ’ t think my family is the worst-case scenario , ” he told the Post . 	0
“ Who knows how many of these families are out there ? 	0
For a variety of reasons , boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls ' learning . 	0
As always there were honourable exceptions . 	0
About 80% of the time you could pick the private school repeats , who immediately asked ' what ' s the answer ? ' rather than ' how can we work it out ? ' 	0
Our kids attended state schools and excelled , one to doctoral level . 	0
Thanks for an entertaining , very timely infomercial for conservative state governments . 	0
SV , that reflects my personal experience of teaching matriculation courses in TAFE . 	0
They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids . . . and research indicates that coddled , spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears . . . . 	0
In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
Most people who send their children to private schools would prefer to save the money and go public . . . if only that system could provide a first class education . 	0
My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator . 	0
Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
Why ? 	0
I went to both , public and private . 	0
The essential difference were the students . 	0
And it makes all the difference . 	0
Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
IHow many young people have the intelligence , drive and courage to do for themselves what this young man did ? 	0
Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
If a teenager told doctors , " I want this treatment " and the parents refused to give consent , what would a court do ? 	0
I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
If a student can show in increased performance in a higher level mainstream class even with resource , great . 	0
Really , I think we need to actually offer individualized education . 	0
And I also see the government abuse for both sides of the spectrum . 	0
That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes . 	0
Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable – and what I ’ m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
Isn ’ t that the fear of parents ? 	0
And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
