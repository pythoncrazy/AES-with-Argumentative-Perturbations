Let me know what you think . 	0
It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
Forced prayer isn ’ t prayer anyway . 	0
When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ’ s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
Social advancement ? 	0
Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
But then everyone is . 	0
But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
Public schools are fad driven . 	0
Remember new math ? 	0
No one does . 	0
Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
All this and more happened to me . 	0
Or leave it to the teacher ( me ) to pick the kid up from a supermarket for shoplifting and sort it out , because they are watching the football . 	0
I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
At school , or homeschooled . 	0
The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0
One high school where I taught had almost 2 , 000 students ; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal ' s office . 	0
Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools . 	0
Neighborhood schools were community gathering places , where parents , kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other . 	0
Run , don ' t walk , to the nearest private school . 	1
Public schools are not about education ; they are about social engineering . 	0
I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
My advice to parents ? 	0
The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
However it may take a little while to really settle down to an “ absence of a rigid routine ” before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0
Greater Freedom “ The morning rush to catch the school bus … it all seems to belong to some distant world now , ” smiles Mariam , who has been homeschooling her only child for the past two years . 	0
I don ’ t know if any school can nourish her love for science as much as my husband and I do . ” 	0
She is my one and only and I want to go all out to nurture her interest . 	0
She simply loves doing what we do . 	0
We do science experiments , go on nature walks , explore the environment around us and create our own worksheets . 	0
“ My daughter Pat loves science . 	0
“ I find the homeschooling system very supportive of the child and his needs ” says Mariam , mother of a seven year old only child . 	0
( check if your state has any restrictive legal requirement in connection with this ) . 	0
I ’ m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
Cooperative education ? 	0
Mainstreaming ? 	0
At the Tech school where I taught seniors once had five hours of shop class in the trade they came there to learn . 	0
Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum . 	0
When I left that school , seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop ; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need , desire or use . 	0
We used to call it " being held back " where I grew up . . . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
They can use tutors , courses , other home educating parents , older children , other specialists with other skills and knowledge , books , science kits , a bought curriculum , internet resources etc etc . Home education is for most a community enterprise . 	0
The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs . 	0
Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
They deserve better . 	0
I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
I don ' t think it works , unless all classes are small ( 15 max ) and all children with needs have one to one help . 	1
If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
The program provides the necessary leisure and opportunity to foster better ties with your child . 	0
This aspect of homeschooling program wins the greatest favor from parents of onlies . 	0
Confidence , self-esteem , pride , self respect are qualities that have to be nurtured by the school too and if the school fails in providing a conducive environment , the parents can take the next step of doing the schooling for their child on their own . 	0
Many parents of single children do worry about the adverse affect of wrong peer group at school on their child . 	0
“ I took my girl out when I found her constantly unhappy or bored at school . 	0
“ Girls , I feel , are more susceptible to peer pressure , teasing and bullying , ” says Vincent . 	0
Religious Freedom In many families , spiritual and religious beliefs are integral to their daily lives . 	0
Being on her own seems to do her a whole lot of good ” he concludes . 	0
Better bonding Understanding the child ’ s needs more closely and being available for them close by is the greatest advantage of homeschooling . 	0
Homeschooling is an option for those families who wish to nurture in their children their spiritual beliefs . 	0
Religion is basically a gang mentality where people feel they need to belong to a group . . . 	0
Thousands of different religions in this world but everyone seems to think that their religion is the only one that counts . . . 	0
If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0
Our education system ( as with our government ) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions . 	0
NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
This worked really well . 	0
I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0
For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
Thankfully our child had to contend only with changing neighborhoods and not schools too . 	0
Since we were homeschooling our only child , we were able to give greater support to him during this time of upheaval and change . ” 	0
“ We have already moved thrice , across states in the past two years . 	0
It has been crazy . 	0
I love being with my only child in other capacities than just a mother , ” adds Mariam . 	0
“ It does not mean no work gets done ; only you take a longer time to explore what works for you and your child . 	0
Believe me , it can be a luxury . 	0
Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1
That ' s why we go to church on Sundays , not the local middle school cafeteria . 	0
When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education , there isn ' t much parents can do . 	0
They re-route tax dollars to themselves . 	0
Happens all the time . 	0
In addition , I don ' t like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school . 	0
I like knowing I have a say is what my children are learning . 	0
No parent would be able to change that in public school unless they are trying to get the school to be more liberal . 	0
A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0
This political correctness is making people less tolerant , creating hard feelings and driving an even bigger wedge between people . . 	0
The school board ' s decision is having the exact opposite effect of what they intended . . 	0
Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
Get it out of public schools 	1
I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
Most wasteful in history ! 	0
Throwing good money after bad never works . 	0
Just look at how our government is run now . 	0
There is no education in public schools any more ! 	0
I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ’ t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
Why would a public school , a school that isn ’ t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ’ t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ’ t believe that bringing ‘ prayer back into the schools ’ will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0
With the vast amount of editorials lobbying for prayer to be back in schools I couldn ’ t help but to disagree . 	0
If you think I should say something I ’ m not or take out something I shouldn ’ t say or any other comments . 	0
They pay for it in addition to paying for the public schools in their taxes . 	0
Parents have the right to send their children to private schools . 	1
Stay out of people ' s personal business ! 	0
So they do invest in public schools even of their child does not attend them . 	0
Great skills all . 	0
You are sure as hell right about that today ; how to roll a joint , how to talk on the phone ; how to take it in the a$$ ! 	0
There is no hope there but why should we wait until something is done . 	0
The problem is that Democrat / socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children . 	0
We keep hearing that public school is where your kids get their social skills to go into the real world . 	0
By that time my kids will be retired ! 	0
2 ) All this is based on generalisations . 	0
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the individuals in this and the individual schools themselves . 	0
I believe these factors play a more important role in determining the better school for the child . 	0
Nevertheless , all things being equal , I think it is generally accepted amongst educators that single-sex schools at high school level is better for learning outcomes than co-ed schools . 	1
It is not just the very young children who benefit from the homeschooling program . 	0
“ Moving my adolescent into a home schooling program was the best decision ever , ” beams Julie . 	0
“ He was frustrated with the early waking hours , jibes from his friends about his weight , heavy homework schedules and lack of rest . 	0
Now three months into homeschooling and his rebelliousness and destructive behavior have reduced drastically , ” she concludes . 	0
While homeschooling does have its advantages , it has its downside too . 	0
Read on to find the negatives of home schooling your only child 	0
Choose Your Pace , Choose Your Subjects Your only child will have the educational freedom to choose what he wants to learn and in a pace that he finds comfortable . 	0
At the same time , the advantages of homeschooling attracted me a great deal , ” she says . 	0
I didn ’ t want to deny him that . 	0
A school is a place where my only child can be with other children . 	0
“ I wanted to be sure I was doing the right thing . 	0
Jessica , parent of an only child who wanted to homeschool her son , gathered a long list of pros and cons from her interactions with other parents who were homeschooling their children . 	0
They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college , universities and at work . 	0
It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0
The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year . 	0
Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0
Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
Same with the daughter . 	0
If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
They went on to do very well . 	0
40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
Sandy 	0
It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
This is NOT true . 	0
Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
Again , do the research . 	0
Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0
His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work . 	0
He met the cutoff to start at 4yo and we sent him . 	0
HIPPO ODS will never be socially en par with his peers , but was reading and writing and adding by 4yo . 	0

A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was " blowing " neither did anyone else . 	0
BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
Our government is based upon hate . 	0
Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
The best education is the only route to go ; and it isn ' t in a public school system . 	1
Knowledge is the only thing that will save you . 	0
Knowledge is power . 	0
I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
Why wouldn ' t they ? 	0
But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
That , not race , is the difference . 	0
It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
Honestly ? 	0
Of course not . 	0
I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‘ if prayer should be in schools ’ debate , because it ’ s a worthless cause . 	0
Instead , let ’ s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
You don ’ t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ’ t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
Prayer that doesn ’ t change the one praying isn ’ t prayer either . 	0
When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ’ s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
