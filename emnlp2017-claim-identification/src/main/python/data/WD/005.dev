It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
Good luck and I hope I helped . 	0
I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
Anyways , I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class , you should try to get him to excel in something . 	0
Anything , it can be his favorite school subject ( in my case , math ) , an instrument ( piano ) , or something else he likes ( in my case , ballet ) . 	0
YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
It is because of what our society has become . 	0
It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
You can pray whenever you want . 	0
Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . ” 	0
But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
I have only one more problem . 	0
Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
This is where the difference is . 	0
Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
We used to call it " being held back " where I grew up . . . 	0
The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem . 	0
Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
That ' s still a baby ! 	0
But I think I ' ll just keep him with me until SK and then let him go . 	0
Why is it called redshirting , I wonder ? 	0
My son was born in December ( cut-off Dec . 31 ) and I have been a little worried for him because they would want him to start JK when he ' s only 3 ! 	0
( physically he ' s an ox , takes after my side of the family ! ) 	0
Besides , you need to think of the kid ' s future . 	0
I ' m not pleased with the full-day kindergarten coming in , but I ' ll worry about that when it gets closer . 	0
( he ' s 2 now ) I thought of holding him back , but my husband was always bored in school and so if he ' s smart like his daddy it might actually work out very well for him to be a bit younger than the other kids . 	0
If all the others are graduating high school at 17 , why does he need to be there until he ' s 18 ? 	0
His whole life is delayed by a year . 	0
She argues that if parents who opt to send their kids to private schools , sent their children to public , the schools the schools would change . 	0
I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
We ’ re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I ’ ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
* He ’ s in the 90th percentile for height and weight so he runs no risk of being picked on for smallness . 	0
The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
Mornings would be ugly . 	0
Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
Children and teenagers can learn more from an education that is personalized , supportive , and based on learning and self satisfaction opposed to test scores and school funding . 	0
If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
They have since then transitioned into public schools and ( from my distant vantage point ) seem to be doing fine . 	0
They ' re very socially capable and seem to be average teenagers . 	0
Let us stop the nonsense , and abuse . 	0
That is the kind of thinking the Chinese and Indian culture is hoping you will continue so 	0
He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
Nonsense . 	0
As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
He would be one of the youngest kindergarteners–and because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
Half a year . 	0
We still have spring and summer before autumn Two whole seasons . 	0
Back-to-school season is far from my mind . 	0
It ’ s snowing as I write this . 	0
My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district ’ s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
In most parts of the country , it ’ s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
But no matter . 	0
After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0
Redshirting a trend ? 	0
This is insane ! 	0
That ' s not a favour , in my opinion . 	0
: P ( surely you don ' t get marks in Kindergarten ? 	0
I have no idea . ) 	0
Now I am extremely confident and star in theatre performances , school choir , am going to take ABRSM Grade 7 for Piano , perfected the AMC 8 , and am taking Pre-Calculus . 	0
So what about being a year older than my classmates ? 	0
I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , no offense . 	1
I am a 12-year-old 6th grader turning 13 in May , so I know what it ’ s like . 	0
Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision : In preschool , I had some issues , just like your son . 	0
Yes , I knew my ABCs since 2 , just like him . 	0
I feel socially confident now , and feel great ( except when I got 91 . 5 / 150 on AMC 10 and 76 . 5 / 150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself ) . 	0
I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
Being at the top of the class is awesome . 	0
I ' ll make sure to remind the teacher of his tender years if he starts getting poor marks for " scissoring skills " . 	0
Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
This is a sticky subject . 	0
Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
Wow . 	0
This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
Interesting . 	0
I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0
Temperaments considered . 	0
Pros and cons must be weighed . 	0
For many parents , the Big Kindergarten Question causes much angst . 	0
With my daughter , I would have preferred a redshirt option but I had no choice because she has a December birthday . 	0
A lot of my friends feel the stress : Kindergarten or preschool ? 	0
At least that ’ s how it seems . 	0
Your child ’ s future success starts RIGHT NOW ! 	0
As do long-term educational goals : Will my kid still get into Harvard if he starts kindergarten without knowing how to write his name ? 	0
I believe he ’ s ready because : * He knows his ABCs , writes his name , recognizes a few sites words and grasps basic math concepts . 	0
For me , the decision was made long ago : Kindergarten get ready for Ryan . 	0
I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers ( not to brag , but you know what I mean ) . 	0
However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
If I had the means to I would send my children to private school . . . . 	1
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
Problems in the schools systems are not the parents fault , it ' s the systems fault . 	0
The answer is probably most . 	0
That ' s a foolish idea . 	0
I bothers me that Allison Benedikt ( I suppose and intelligent woman ) makes the statement and it further bothers me that this article says her argument is " compelling . " 	0
The argument that sending your kids to private school is bad parenting is nonsensical . 	0
What are parents to do when school boards respond for the calls for reform with the formation of yet another useless committee that will investigate the matter and make recommendations that are never put into effect . 	0
What are parents to do when Unions refuse to correct or fire ineffective school teachers because they have tenure and are protected by unions . 	0
It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
So now our kids are exposed to more bad teaching . 	0
Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach , we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system . 	0
We have no regrets as he is now trying to " fix " the problem from the inside by teaching in public schools . 	0
My son benefited from sacrifice that affected me and the wife into our retirement . 	0
You get a bad car to drive and no guarantee that you have helped the company . 	0
Putting our children into a bad system to improve it is like buying a bad car from a company that is in trouble for it ' s quality problems . 	0
NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years . 	0
YES we need to improve the public system . 	0
Miss Benidikt makes the statement that " you want the best for your child but your child doesn ' t need it " . 	0
The competition that private schools give to public will only improve the latter . 	0
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan ’ s help . 	0
Ryan ’ s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
The question mark is his maturity . 	0
He can be impulsive . 	0
My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
People are always afraid . 	0
Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
I can save you I can save you from what ’ s to come . 	0
How many parents are there have their kids in public schools that wish the school system was different . 	0
He instills fear into people . 	0
All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that . 	0
You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0
Look at it this way . 	0
~Freya Edholm 	0
I am the only quiet person in this loud family . 	0
I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0
Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he ’ s bored . 	0
( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
( His hearing has been tested and , yes , he ’ s fine ) . 	0
Another issue is Ryan ’ s loudness . 	0
But his father is loud and so is his older sister . 	0
It ’ s as if he ’ s a broken volume button on an old radio , stuck on high no matter what . 	0
Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL . 	0
That if someone is FEELING bad and they don ’ t FEEL like going to work today then they don ’ t . 	0
and for the author of this article to call it compelling is sad . 	0
Your argument is stupid . 	0
If millions of frustrated parents cannot change the system , what makes you think a few others can . 	0
Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
Our government is based upon hate . 	0
Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
The best education is the only route to go ; and it isn ' t in a public school system . 	1
Knowledge is the only thing that will save you . 	0
Knowledge is power . 	0
I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
Why wouldn ' t they ? 	0
Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
But much of it is mythology . 	0
Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
I have been advised to put my money in private schools , or else save it for attorneys later . 	0
It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0
Thank you for your time . 	0
-Mick 	0
I don ' t think we should pretend it couldn ' t happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is , in itself , highly damaging . 	0
