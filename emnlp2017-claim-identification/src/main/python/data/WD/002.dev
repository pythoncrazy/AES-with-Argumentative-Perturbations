In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0
Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality . 	0
De La Salle would have mixed results because although single-sex education does have its benefits to boys , there is no clear evidence that exists either way . 	0
Regina high school would benefit the most because their girls would have higher self-esteem and higher self-confidence in their learning abilities then they would at a coeducational school . 	0
I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1
My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children ' s education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system . . 	0
It is heartbreaking . 	0
It ' s a hugely complicated situation that balances child protection and the assumption that a child ' s parents are the best source of protection for them ( the current default position for child care ) . 	0
Frankly , I doubt that any real answer will be found on this thread . 	0
This was different . 	0
This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ’ re giving up . 	0
Those schools weren ’ t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they—that is , you—need special treatment ; boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting—you won ’ t know what hit you ! 	0
If we ’ d chosen an all-girls ’ school , that would be one thing . 	0
I ’ d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0
We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school . some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools . 	0
And there ’ s the real trouble with this single-sex approach . 	0
The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain silly—which might make them easy for kids who don ’ t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0
“ In the single-sex classes , teachers used microphones that allow them to electronically adjust the tone of their voice to match the level that research suggests is best for boys . 	0
Now segregation by gender is more often an intervention for boys—a switch in target that makes you wonder a little about the reliability of the justifications for the policy . 	0
“ The goal was to address the struggles boys were having with reading , ” the A . P . story explains of the effort in an Idaho school . 	0
All this and more happened to me . 	0
Or leave it to the teacher ( me ) to pick the kid up from a supermarket for shoplifting and sort it out , because they are watching the football . 	0
I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
At school , or homeschooled . 	0
The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
Research is quite clear about this . 	0
One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with . " 	0
Co-ed schools don ' t cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes , That ' s a myth . . . otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges ? 	0
Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside . 	0
No wonder why our educational standards are sliding . . 	0
Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt . 	0
Most Kids are distracted , do a lot of sexting , indulge / experiment in sexual acts , go on emotional outbursts ( act like adults ! ) and so on . . . 	0
I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs . 	0

Until that is done boys will be boys and do succeed in the coeducation environment while girls do not . 	0
My daughter chose to attend public high school . 	0
In a school of 2 , 500 kids , less than 10% of the parents attended orientation . 	0
I sent my kids to a private , religious based school . 	0
I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives . 	0
Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0
Everyone went to orientation . 	0
I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0
Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child , you met with the teacher and / or the principle and worked out a solution . 	0
They never had any issues with bullying ( they had an anti-bullying program before it was popular ) . 	0
I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families . 	0
All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn : homemaking skills " . 	0
One of the girls , who has not been taught for two years , could be Josh Powell ' s twin . 	0
She is intelligent and desperate to learn , but her parents won ' t allow it . 	0
Thank you for bringing this tragedy to light . 	0
I am a Christian , an educator , a student and a parent and I have seen too many children like the Powells . 	0
As an admissions officer , we had applicants whose " record keeping " consisted of sending boxes full of paper for our office to review as part of the application . 	0
If their students did get an interview , which was rare , they didn ' t have the social skills to survive the first round . 	0
That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
The evidence wasn ’ t very good then for a gap between the genders ’ learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn ’ t gotten any better . 	0
Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , “ fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . ” 	0
Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
Most people didn ’ t know much about brain science , but that didn ’ t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0
In one way , the fashion in single-sex classrooms has not changed at all . 	0
“ Math class is tough ! ” as that infamous talking Barbie complained . 	0
I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
If you come out on the other side deficient , it ’ s hard to make up for that . 	0

" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0

Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0

I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies – I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
The reformers ’ talk was all about “ How Schools Shortchange Girls ” ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were “ Failing at Fairness ” ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias—the children involved were more committed students—and to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
In an article called , bluntly , “ The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ” which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance . ” 	0
A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ’ and girls ’ classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ’ s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ’ re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
In the boys ’ classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to “ blow off steam . ” 	0
In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
I highly recommend a co-ed school . 	1
That is the kind of thinking the Chinese and Indian culture is hoping you will continue so 	0
Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ” 	0
Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ’ s better for disabled children . 	0
This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
To that end , the ‘ integration vs . segregation ’ argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
I feel that it is almost certain that ‘ special ’ education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school . 	1
Okay , if I had children now they would go to private school . 	1
I am a police officer and work part time at a private school and the attitude there is totally different . 	0
The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun . 	0
If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there , we are arresting someone . 	0
Of course , we all know that bad parents exist . 	0
But typically , the state tends to make the worst parent of all , and I don ' t need its kinds of lessons . 	0
Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
“ It ’ s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
And on and on . 	0
Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
That ’ s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
the teachers were not sufficiently trained to deal with him , we were constantly called to the school to sort it out ( when tbh we had no idea how either ! ) he was suspended more times than i remember and was only on half days ! 	0
forgot to add , my son was very disruptive and dangerous alot of the time in mainstream , because he couldn ' t cope . 	0
the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people ' s attitudes . . . it doesn ' t in my experience . . . they only did it to save money 	0
( which i ' ve later discovered is actually illegal ) . . . so no , it wasn ' t fair on the other kids . . . not fair on him either . 	0
Private through 8th grade then public HS . 	0
This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure . . . but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off . 	0
Private schools = better education ? 	0
Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families . 	0
If you don ' t want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality , private schools are the only way to go . 	1
It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0
More specifically whether mainstream education or ‘ special ’ education is better for disabled children . 	0
In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0
My six-year-old daughter is educated by me , at home . 	0
The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‘ liberation ’ , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ’ t been considered . 	0
But I don ' t bring it up and it ' s " yeah , us too , so how is your dd liking her new music teacher ? " 	0
So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck , I don ' t think she realizes my kid is too . 	0
I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
The same goes for girls . 	0
Although Im pretty sure someone will scream about how dare I assume they ' re abusive etc . . . 	0
But you either have some checking of child welfare or none . 	0
I ' ve obviously not got the answers ! 	0
By no means is bullying exclusive to disabled children . 	0
That said , it can pose an obstacle to integration , a point rarely raised in the surrounding discussions . 	0
. 	0
. 	0
Disabled people need an avenue for effective , direct engagement with such important arguments ; ultimately they are the ones affected . 	0
I myself have experienced both ; I attended The Court Special School until year-two , before moving into mainstream St Monica ’ s and then Whitchurch High School . 	0
Furthermore there is a distinct lack of disabled voices in this debate . 	0
Discussions often become the property of parents , politicians , education ‘ experts ’ or proxy organization ’ s , such as disabled charities . 	0
My journey has not been easy by any means . 	0
Personally my move to mainstream education was the best choice as I never really struggled academically ( my disability manifests itself more often on an interpersonal level ) , although this would never have worked for me if I hadn ’ t had provision for my disability , such as a learning support assistant ( LSA ) to help me remain focused . 	1
That said my Asperger ’ s Syndrome is rather mild and what works for me may be totally unsuitable for someone else . 	0
Unfortunately , as Josh Powell ' s experience shows , sometimes even parents who want to do the best they can for their children may not succeed . 	0
Though the state must respect a parent ' s right to offer an education consistent with their religious beliefs , sometimes maybe a parent needs to respect the expertise of others when it comes to determining what makes a quality education . 	0
If you ’ re a loving parent , the last thing you want to do is create a situation where your children are limited or hindered . ” 	0
Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : “ A good education is not an option . 	0
I ’ ll state the obvious : some boys do ; some don ’ t . 	0
Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
It ’ s essential . 	0
You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
There is pressure for all our pupils today in school – in fact far too much and too early . 	0
We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‘ whole ’ person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ’ s view that girls are not some ‘ alien creature ’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
But that did not turn out to be the long-term problem . 	0
As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ’ performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
Same with the daughter . 	0
If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
They went on to do very well . 	0
40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
So now our kids are exposed to more bad teaching . 	0
Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach , we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system . 	0
We have no regrets as he is now trying to " fix " the problem from the inside by teaching in public schools . 	0
My son benefited from sacrifice that affected me and the wife into our retirement . 	0
You get a bad car to drive and no guarantee that you have helped the company . 	0
Putting our children into a bad system to improve it is like buying a bad car from a company that is in trouble for it ' s quality problems . 	0
NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years . 	0
YES we need to improve the public system . 	0
St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
Miss Benidikt makes the statement that " you want the best for your child but your child doesn ' t need it " . 	0
The competition that private schools give to public will only improve the latter . 	0
The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ’ schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
I have experience working in all boys ’ schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ’ school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
Girls like reading ; boys don ’ t . 	0
They went to school with them . 	0
They grew up with them . 	0
. 	0
Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
But I didn ' t say it . 	0
Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
. 	0
I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0
Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school ( maybe their " brother " school ) , guys from the train station , the arcade . 	0
Surely as a parent you ' d feel more OK knowing that your daughter was with someone she knew ? 	0
. 	0
. 	0
They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they ' ve just met – and not really knowing anything about them . 	0
you get my drift . 	0
And if they ' re not getting it at school , they ' ll get it elsewhere . 	0
Girls LIKE male attention . 	0
It ' s a crappy situation , and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case , because they ' re not even walking a thin line anymore , they ' re trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care . 	0
So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur ( the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority ) , and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day , a determined abuser will wait till the last minute . 	0
And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won ' t be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children , there will be someone somewhere who does , and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur . 	0
However . . . 	0
Removal of a child from established programs and situations ( such as state education ) will always raise a question mark in these times . 	0
As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don ' t show it theses days . . . 	0
Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that ' s says 95% is reflecting their area . . 	0
Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
Some parents feel that public schools will contradict the religious values they are attempting to teach their kids . 	0
Sometimes local public schools are themselves doing a poor job of educating students . 	0
I don ’ t think my family is the worst-case scenario , ” he told the Post . 	0
“ Who knows how many of these families are out there ? 	0
However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0
For a variety of reasons , boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls ' learning . 	0
. 	0
My two cents . 	0
But a friend in my all-girls school showed me some drugs IN school . 	0
. 	0
Of course , turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark , but generally these things mean nothing in isolation ( an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark , but you ' ll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it ) . 	0
Also , he states that some coeducational advocates view single-sex education for girls as emphasizing male dominant views like competitiveness and individuality which do not improve male-female equity ( Mael , 1998 ) . 	0
Back in the mid-nineties , when I was reporting on single-sex classrooms , evolutionary psychology was hot , and “ hardwired ” was the new buzz word , injected like a vitamin shot into weak arguments . 	0
School is a place of learning . 	0
Pray at home . 	1
But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
—but there is always going to be bullying . 	0
On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
That , not race , is the difference . 	0
It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
—The boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together —many girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about " being bad readers " and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment . 	0
I teach single sex classes to 7th and 8th grade students IN the Bronx similar to in the article and here is what I ' ve found . 	0
As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
coed OR single sex is not going to change any of that because 13 year old girls are the devil —you spend an inordinate time talking about medal of honor / twilight 	0
As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
The media often frame the argument as one of “ integration ” and “ segregation ” . 	0
However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more “ positive school behavior ” to model . 	0
In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
“ In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
“ Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . ” 	0
In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states “ There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents … . girls report that they feel more comfortable … interact more with teachers … and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . ” 	0
( Van Houte , 2004 ) ” The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
I am a single mother and I make less than most people , and I am sending my child to a private school . 	0
So I guess I am a bad person ! 	0
So I am suppose to sacrifice my child education , for the sake of the countries ? 	0
It was shitty prior to her birth or mine ? 	0
I don ' t want to be the hate figure here , but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn ' t be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers . 	0
And yeah , I agree that people shouldn ' t be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching . 	0
I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
If a student can show in increased performance in a higher level mainstream class even with resource , great . 	0
Really , I think we need to actually offer individualized education . 	0
And I also see the government abuse for both sides of the spectrum . 	0
Correction . . . worked hard and made sacrifices to afford PRIVATE school . 	0
The people who are demanding " Tolerance " are the biggest hypocrites of them all . 	0
All of this is avoided at most private schools . 	0
That is what is wrong . 	0
They have a Gay Straight Alliance club , but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as " intolerant " which is complete BS . 	0
Salomone also states that single-sex schooling for promotes interest for boys in humanities courses and that boys ’ feel more at ease because they do not feel societal pressures to be male . 	0
As mentioned in a study by Mael ( 1998 ) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would , it could also reduce sex stereotypes . 	0
