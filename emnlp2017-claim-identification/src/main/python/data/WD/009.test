But Mrs . Cooper also has a more immediate reason for encouraging prayer . 	0
And it ’ s a reminder that they can apply the principles of their faith – like hard work and honesty – to school . ” 	0
“ It shows the students that we understand they are spiritual beings . 	0
“ I ask the teachers to say a prayer at each assembly , ” says Principal Cooper . 	0
But prayer seems to be a de facto norm . 	0
But a school ’ s governing body – typically made up of parents , community members , and teachers – can approve the inclusion of certain religious practices , including prayers , if it feels those practices are in the school ’ s best interest . 	0
By law , South African public schools are not allowed to promote a particular faith . 	0
Two years ago , an instructor at COSAT was teaching students Arabic prayers , and sometimes asking them to recite the prayers in class . 	0
She ’ s Muslim , and she worries what would happen if she didn ’ t allow prayer at the school . 	0
So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
About 80 percent of South Africans self-identify as Christians . 	0
So it ’ s nice to hear prayer at school . ” 	0
“ Some of us don ’ t have the chance to go to church on Sundays , because of homework and chores . 	0
Her friend , Lindokuhle , agreed . 	0
“ I like the prayer , ” a tenth-grader named Sinoxolo told me after this morning ’ s assembly . 	0
It ’ s often given in Xhosa – the first language of most COSAT students . 	0
At COSAT , school assemblies usually begin with a prayer , delivered by a teacher . 	0
COSAT ’ s principal , Phadiela Cooper , says there are two kinds of students at the school : Christians , and Christians who don ’ t practice as much . 	0
In predominantly black , urban townships like Khayelitsha , the number is even higher . 	0
And We are going to do everything in our power to follow that conviction . 	0
I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the " moral standards " ( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her . 	0
I could care less if she thinks I am a bad parent . 	0
I just wanted to present a much more common iteration . 	0
tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
This was different . 	0
This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ’ re giving up . 	0
Those schools weren ’ t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they—that is , you—need special treatment ; boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting—you won ’ t know what hit you ! 	0
If we ’ d chosen an all-girls ’ school , that would be one thing . 	0
I ’ d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
COSAT ’ s governing body hasn ’ t made a formal decision on religious practices . 	0
Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same . 	0
I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school ( one that I had done a lot of background checking into first ) . 	0
Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0
There ' s no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today ' s times . 	1
The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways . 	0
There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down . 	0
The neighboring county public schools are the same . 	0
When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing . 	0
Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church . 	0
I ' m proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon ! 	1
Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight , like quality education , not quantity education , and not buying unneeded items like bleachers , I ' ll consider sending my kids . . . . wait , nevermind ! 	0
No I won ' t ! 	0
And there ’ s the real trouble with this single-sex approach . 	0
The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain silly—which might make them easy for kids who don ’ t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0
“ In the single-sex classes , teachers used microphones that allow them to electronically adjust the tone of their voice to match the level that research suggests is best for boys . 	0
Now segregation by gender is more often an intervention for boys—a switch in target that makes you wonder a little about the reliability of the justifications for the policy . 	0
“ The goal was to address the struggles boys were having with reading , ” the A . P . story explains of the effort in an Idaho school . 	0
I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
It is because of what our society has become . 	0
It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
You can pray whenever you want . 	0
Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . ” 	0
But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
Studies have shown girls perform better ( academically ) in all-girls high schools than in co-ed . 	0
Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
It ' s 12 : 40 . . . 	0
The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
The evidence wasn ’ t very good then for a gap between the genders ’ learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn ’ t gotten any better . 	0
Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , “ fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . ” 	0
Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
Most people didn ’ t know much about brain science , but that didn ’ t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0
In one way , the fashion in single-sex classrooms has not changed at all . 	0
“ Math class is tough ! ” as that infamous talking Barbie complained . 	0
I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
A twelfth-grader named Pumela also said she doesn ’ t care for the school prayer . 	0
“ I ’ m not really religious , ” she said , as she stepped out of sight of a teacher . 	0
“ I am not a Christian , ” said Mrs . Mohammed , an English teacher . 	0
“ And I don ’ t think we should do anything that promotes one religion over another . ” 	0
But not everyone is thrilled about the inclusion of prayer in school . 	1
Several teachers have voiced their dissatisfaction . 	0
Mrs . Cooper also invites parents to pray at the beginning of parent meetings . 	0
She says this gesture breaks down cultural barriers , and helps her gain acceptance in the community . 	0
“ I had to tell the teacher to stop , ” Mrs . Cooper said . 	0
“ I was worried the parents would think we were trying to convert their children to Islam – or trying to incite a jihad , ” she said , laughing . 	0
Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
I wish . 	0
No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
And so children die . 	0
If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
Lets keep it that way . 	0
There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0

Lesson plans ( and the national curriculum ) are the death of real education . 	0
Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
The reformers ’ talk was all about “ How Schools Shortchange Girls ” ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were “ Failing at Fairness ” ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias—the children involved were more committed students—and to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
In an article called , bluntly , “ The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ” which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance . ” 	0
A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ’ and girls ’ classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ’ s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ’ re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
In the boys ’ classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to “ blow off steam . ” 	0
In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
I have two children . 	0
My daughter who is a Junior attends public school and my son who is a Sophomore is in his first year at private school . 	0
Every child is different and their needs are different . 	0
She excels in public school . 	0
My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0
Let us stop the nonsense , and abuse . 	0
My husband and I agreed , that if our son has to be held back , it will be when we ' re sure he ' s not keeping up with the kids and Pre-K is not that time . 	0
One major reason - God is not allowed in the public schools , but He is more than welcomed in the private ! 	0
He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off . 	0
He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well , considering he is the youngest in the class . 	0
Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
Pre-K was only 3 hours long , while Kindergarten was a full day . 	0
When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ” 	0
Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ’ s better for disabled children . 	0
This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
To that end , the ‘ integration vs . segregation ’ argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
I feel that it is almost certain that ‘ special ’ education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
And on and on . 	0
Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
That ’ s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0
But don ' t assume that one size fits everybody , because it doesn ' t . 	1
If you really enjoyed school , good for you . 	0
Each to his own , as I said . 	0
I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard . 	0
Trust me , I know . 	0
First hand . 	0
Learn what ? 	0
The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
It ' s all good . 	0
Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
Interesting . 	0
I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
Oh come on . 	0
In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0
More specifically whether mainstream education or ‘ special ’ education is better for disabled children . 	0
Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‘ liberation ’ , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ’ t been considered . 	0
The same goes for girls . 	0
It was boring , tedious , slow and frustrating . 	0
Which mine did . 	0
The coincidence of age and living in the same area were all there was to go on . 	0
Why should I ? 	0
I just had nothing in common with the people I went to school with . 	0
cannibaldave Not particularly unusual among the people I know . 	0
All it needs to do is to fail to provide a totally unstimulating environment . 	0
A school doesn ' t need to be ' a nightmarish bully fest ' to be a bane . 	0
The friends I had were of all ages and from a variety of different localities . 	0
You could call that in itself a very narrow prospect . 	0
2 . ) 	0
Children are not owned by the government , and the government cannot tell people how to raise their children . 	0
I see a lot of you on both sides saying this too . 	0
Every child is different . 	0
My school has a heavy focus on writing , and using essays . 	0
Homeschooling allows you to tailor your education to whatever way helps you learn best . 	0
Other schools have other methods . 	0
This really helps me retain the information , and so it ' s wonderful for me . 	0
3 . ) 	0
But when you put 30 kids in one classroom , it becomes very difficult to teach them all individually . 	0
I know some of you are saying , " Well , in MY public school they didn ' t . . . . " and that ' s great . 	0
The public school system in most places is out of control . 	0
By no means is bullying exclusive to disabled children . 	0
That said , it can pose an obstacle to integration , a point rarely raised in the surrounding discussions . 	0
Disabled people need an avenue for effective , direct engagement with such important arguments ; ultimately they are the ones affected . 	0
I myself have experienced both ; I attended The Court Special School until year-two , before moving into mainstream St Monica ’ s and then Whitchurch High School . 	0
Furthermore there is a distinct lack of disabled voices in this debate . 	0
Discussions often become the property of parents , politicians , education ‘ experts ’ or proxy organization ’ s , such as disabled charities . 	0
My journey has not been easy by any means . 	0
Personally my move to mainstream education was the best choice as I never really struggled academically ( my disability manifests itself more often on an interpersonal level ) , although this would never have worked for me if I hadn ’ t had provision for my disability , such as a learning support assistant ( LSA ) to help me remain focused . 	1
That said my Asperger ’ s Syndrome is rather mild and what works for me may be totally unsuitable for someone else . 	0
I ’ ll state the obvious : some boys do ; some don ’ t . 	0
But that did not turn out to be the long-term problem . 	0
Kids have too much homework ; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep . 	0
4 . ) 	0
You don ' t have as much busywork . 	0
Maybe for the people who live in that neighborhood , homeschooling isn ' t the better option . 	0
But I had to go to my local public school to take the PSAT and someone was getting arrested as we were leaving . 	0
That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ’ performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0

I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
So those are my main points . 	0
I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
Girls like reading ; boys don ’ t . 	0
The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
People are always afraid . 	0
Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0

So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0

This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0

I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
So in some cases there ' s a safety issue . 	0
In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0

You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0
Look at it this way . 	0
My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0

“ I just go along with it because I don ’ t want to feel different . ” 	0
As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0

As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
The media often frame the argument as one of “ integration ” and “ segregation ” . 	0
However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0

First of all let me say , my children attend a private school . 	0
Our district schools are less than admirable . 	0
Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0
I ' m still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district . . . whether I agree with it or not ! 	0
Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year . 	0
Really ? 	0
It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0
Thank you for your time . 	0
