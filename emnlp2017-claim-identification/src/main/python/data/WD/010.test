However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0
I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done / evaluated on an individual basis . 	0
ed kid w / the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg . 	0
ed . child whether doing so is desired by them & beneficial for their child . 	0
The fact of the matter is that doing so ( calming down a student ) is not their job or their responsibility . 	0
Some schools , though , such as my dcs ' , will repeatedly place a reg . 	0
Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
The other teacher did not . 	0
It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
What ’ s next ? 	0
If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
Best decision they ever made . 	1
My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8 . 	1
My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school . 	0
I was ahead of my peers by high school . 	0
Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively . 	0
My kids attend public school now and I detest it . 	0
In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
It ' s human nature . 	0
The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
What a stupid argument ! 	0
Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
The more people leave , the worse its going to become . 	0
The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0
I attended a single sex high school some 40 years ago . 	0
Granted that was a different day but still I cherish the memory . 	0
Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction . 	0
If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
The Supreme Court said that it violated the establishment clause of the Constitution to have this prayer , even though the prayer was a generic prayer . 	0
You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
" Parents make that decision for all kinds of different reasons . 	0
Her son , now 13 , has a best friend one year younger than he is . 	0
The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem . 	0
Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down . 	0
She argues that if parents who opt to send their kids to private schools , sent their children to public , the schools the schools would change . 	0
We ’ re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I ’ ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
* He ’ s in the 90th percentile for height and weight so he runs no risk of being picked on for smallness . 	0
I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
Why would anyone write an article sighting that parents are " bad " for choosing private over public , let me guess , probably a progressive liberal who feels that ALL children need to be indoctrinated with garbage and forced sexuality that is not age appropriate . 	0
If I had school age children , they would not go to any public school . 	1
I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
Mornings would be ugly . 	0
Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
Children and teenagers can learn more from an education that is personalized , supportive , and based on learning and self satisfaction opposed to test scores and school funding . 	0
Please stop , reverse your decision and realize that religion , all religions , have no use in our education system , our government and technically speaking ( even those whom are dedicated to their faith ) 98% of the hours with a calendar year . 	1
They have since then transitioned into public schools and ( from my distant vantage point ) seem to be doing fine . 	0
I am happy to shop consignment stores and forego other luxuries such as vacations to give my kids the best possible education . 	0
We have shared one family car-a 7 year old Dodge mini-van and make many other financial sacrifices in order to make this possible for our children . 	0
We enjoy being part of a very involved and caring school community . 	0
We certainly are NOT wealthy , but we choose to send our children to a Catholic school where they can learn our faith as well as benefit from smaller class sizes and high academic expectations . 	1
They ' re very socially capable and seem to be average teenagers . 	0
With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money , hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform ! 	0
While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
The top reason my friends say they didn ’ t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ’ t listen to them . 	0
He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
Many readers addressed this saying it ’ s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
I have to say , I ’ m with them . 	0
Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ’ t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
Nonsense . 	0
As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
He might feel more confident dealing with older students , " she said . 	0
Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
He would be one of the youngest kindergarteners–and because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
Half a year . 	0
We still have spring and summer before autumn Two whole seasons . 	0
Back-to-school season is far from my mind . 	0
It ’ s snowing as I write this . 	0
My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district ’ s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
In most parts of the country , it ’ s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
But no matter . 	0
*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
Not all public schools suck , but most do . 	1
Some teachers need to be fired , some retired , and some need to change vocations . 	0
Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
None of us are perfect . 	0
That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
Actually , I don ’ t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0
Temperaments considered . 	0
Pros and cons must be weighed . 	0
For many parents , the Big Kindergarten Question causes much angst . 	0
With my daughter , I would have preferred a redshirt option but I had no choice because she has a December birthday . 	0
A lot of my friends feel the stress : Kindergarten or preschool ? 	0
At least that ’ s how it seems . 	0
Your child ’ s future success starts RIGHT NOW ! 	0
As do long-term educational goals : Will my kid still get into Harvard if he starts kindergarten without knowing how to write his name ? 	0
I believe he ’ s ready because : * He knows his ABCs , writes his name , recognizes a few sites words and grasps basic math concepts . 	0
For me , the decision was made long ago : Kindergarten get ready for Ryan . 	0
Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
Prayer is a frontal attack on the notion that mankind is in autonomous control of his own destiny and an insult to those who believe that friends , possessions , or power can bring meaning or joy . 	0
That is scary for rest of us . 	0
A primary purpose of public education is to shape good citizens . 	0
No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
If you can I would suggest Private schooling . 	1
Worked for us . 	0
I guess it depends on your child as well and the dynamics of your family ( boys / girls / both / number of kids ) . 	0
We have 2 boys and they are going to a boys only private school and we ' re thinking of sending them to a boys only High school as well . 	0
Problems in the schools systems are not the parents fault , it ' s the systems fault . 	0
The answer is probably most . 	0
That ' s a foolish idea . 	0
I bothers me that Allison Benedikt ( I suppose and intelligent woman ) makes the statement and it further bothers me that this article says her argument is " compelling . " 	0
The argument that sending your kids to private school is bad parenting is nonsensical . 	0
What are parents to do when school boards respond for the calls for reform with the formation of yet another useless committee that will investigate the matter and make recommendations that are never put into effect . 	0
What are parents to do when Unions refuse to correct or fire ineffective school teachers because they have tenure and are protected by unions . 	0
Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0

This article was nothing more than union propaganda because we all know how supportive unions are of non-union entities . 	0
One more thing , at least a private school can FIRE a teacher for legitimate reasons ( molesting kids , etc ) unlike public schools who ' s teachers unions have PROTECTED those who have committed crimes against our children ( ex . 	0

The teachers from my experience , expect the students to teach themselves , they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends ( other staff ) , take care of personal business etc . Oh and now in Ca . , add the confusion of gender identity to the mix , where 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2% , causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is " I feel like a boy / girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today " and now preteen / teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room / shower any time he wants , even while girls are showering . 	0
Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the ( lack of ) education he was receiving was not up to standard . 	0

Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
The next thing I know there are thousands of readers “ recommending ” my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
It drives me nuts . 	0
How many parents are there have their kids in public schools that wish the school system was different . 	0
This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0

When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
one hour out of 48 is not alot . 	0
ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok . i go to a private catholic school and at school we pray three times it not that much and only takes up like 5 minutes total for the whole day 	1
first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness . 	0
and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour . 	0
A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late " substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade , and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores . 	0
According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0
Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home , or not socially or academically adept . 	0
" We find that between 4 and 5 . 5 percent of children delay kindergarten , a lower number than typically reported … 	0
A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0
It ' s a phenomenon known as redshirting . 	0
More parents are putting off a child ' s kindergarten entry so he or she will be a little older than the classmates . 	0
" It has always been in practice , but it has gotten more attention recently and people are talking more about it , " said Vela , a mother of three and a preschool teacher for 25 years . 	0
" The reasons parents choose to redshirt their child vary , depending on the child ' s emotional , social and academic readiness to join school , " Dana Vela , president of Sunrise Preschools , in Arizona , said in an interview with ABCNews . com . 	0
In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
I am the only quiet person in this loud family . 	0
I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0
Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he ’ s bored . 	0
( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
( His hearing has been tested and , yes , he ’ s fine ) . 	0
Another issue is Ryan ’ s loudness . 	0
But his father is loud and so is his older sister . 	0
It ’ s as if he ’ s a broken volume button on an old radio , stuck on high no matter what . 	0
So it ' s really up to the parent to decide for their child , " said Vela . 	0
You also find children who are ready to leave home at an even younger age . 	0
Last week I learned the definition of “ going viral . ” 	0
Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
I credit my earlier classroom experiences for my chutzpah . 	0
But being a social scientist I can ' t help but look to the literature ( incidentally , the well-researched footnotes are one of Lean In ' s strongest features , and worth a read ) , and that ' s when the picture becomes more complicated . 	0
At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
Some of my classes were coed . 	0
The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
Ultimately , we as a society lose . 	0
Our society just isn ' t gear for that . 	0
and for the author of this article to call it compelling is sad . 	0
Your argument is stupid . 	0
If millions of frustrated parents cannot change the system , what makes you think a few others can . 	0
We can test a child academically but we can never test their emotional readiness . 	0
They sometimes are not ready to leave home at the age of five and the separation anxiety will impact them for a long time . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
Let ’ s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
Being aware of your child ’ s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ’ s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0

All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
But much of it is mythology . 	0
Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0
There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0
Alternately , estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes . 	0
They are dealing with children of ages ranging between four and a half and six and a half . 	0
" The teacher is mostly impacted by it . 	0
As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0
