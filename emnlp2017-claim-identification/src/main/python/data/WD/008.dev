Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as " religious " . 	0
It ' s in danger of becoming one of those joke laws , like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester , and needs to be removed . 	0
Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0
This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies . 	0
We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive . 	0
What a stupid argument ! 	0
Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools – those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
There were knife fights and drugs all over . 	0
There was no guidance from any of the teachers and my guidance counselor was a joke . 	0
NONE . 	0
It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
this was 1970 . 	0
Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
This is nuts . 	0
I went to a crappy high school . 	0
But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
Personally i ' d go co-ed . 	1
As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
Private through 8th grade then public HS . 	0
This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure . . . but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off . 	0
Private schools = better education ? 	0
Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families . 	0
If you don ' t want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality , private schools are the only way to go . 	1
It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0
The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
No religious activities in schools . 	1
The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0
The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
There will be reprecusions for the choices that have been made without God . 	0
But do remember – God is not mocked . 	0
Every knee shall bow , and every tongue will confess the Jesus Christ is Lord . 	0
This country in now the most liberal county , we allow everything to go . 	0
After all that God has done to make this the richest land ever , this is how we show our thanks . 	0
I too believed that out nation is under a great fall due taking prayer out of schools and attempting to take God out of everything we do . 	0
Our country has lost morales and respect for God . 	0
Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
I didn ' t . 	0
Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
I had no idea . 	0
Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
The people who are demanding " Tolerance " are the biggest hypocrites of them all . 	0
All of this is avoided at most private schools . 	0
That is what is wrong . 	0
They have a Gay Straight Alliance club , but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as " intolerant " which is complete BS . 	0
