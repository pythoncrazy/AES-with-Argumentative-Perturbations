I just spent the better part of a day with the faculty of the all-girls Ellis School in Pittsburgh , where I was reminded of all the best aspects of my own education around gender and gender roles . 	0
The survival of excellent girls ' and boys ' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man . 	0
We celebrate the suddenly disproportionate success of girls in the conventional academic realm ( they do so much better in high school that they disadvantage one another when it comes to competitive college admission ) while we wonder whether one of our unending culture wars is on boys . 	0
Education for boys and young men is changing , and it ' s heartening , for example , to note that old-fashioned expressions of stereotypical maleness , like those caught on tape when Rutgers coach Mike Rice went off on his players , excite general shock and outrage . 	0
Curricula increasingly include diverse viewpoints , and access to self and creativity are as much a part of boys ' school programs as lacrosse and basketball ; schools work hard to imbue students with more beneficent ideas of what it means to be male , with responsibilities and difference equal parts of the equation . 	0
The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds . 	0
They have a 100% college acceptance rate ! 	0
I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools . 	1
And as a public school teacher I ' m well aware of those problems . 	0
This is bat insane ? 	0
Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if " everyone does it " that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education ! ! ! 	0
No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the " greater good " if at all possible . 	0
It ' s a hugely complicated situation that balances child protection and the assumption that a child ' s parents are the best source of protection for them ( the current default position for child care ) . 	0
Frankly , I doubt that any real answer will be found on this thread . 	0
Once they start working , or going to college , they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in , and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old . 	0
It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world . 	0
Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy . 	0
They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith . 	0
I don ' t know about the rest of Virginia , but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools . 	1
The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some . 	0
There should NOT be any praying in school . 	1
Praying is a home thing , or a church , temple , synagogue or what have you exercise . 	0
Prayer is not for public consumption . 	0
Our esteemed government should also change the words of the national anthem to eliminate the sentence that is a prayer . 	0
Canada is a secular nation . 	0
Let ' s keep it that way . 	0
Just do what ' s best for your kids . 	0
Private schools don ' t promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles . 	0
Also , the private schools don ' t teach all of this anti American social justice crap . 	0
It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities , and that they can play on either team in sports , male or female . 	0
Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago . 	0
I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois . 	0
The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore . 	1
It ' s pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don ' t belong here . 	0
My kids didn ' t speak Spanish , so I pulled them out , and they went to private schools after that . 	0
Perhaps some Homeschool kids are ' awkward " and all that , but all the ones I know , are not . 	0
My friend and her family are Homeschoolers and they are all friendly and funny and wonderfully nice people . 	0
etc . . . . why would you put your child in that situation ? 	0
( No offense to anyone here , don ' t take this wrongly . ) 	0
My parents decided to Homeschool me ( and the rest of my siblings ) because they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools . 	0
All the drugs , swearing , bullying , condoms being handed out to young children who shouldn ' t even know what sex is yet , evolution . 	0
But besides that , God has commanded us to train up our children , not give them to someone else where you have no control over what they are taught . 	0
And what they are taught is directly against him . 	0

Good luck and I hope I helped . 	0
Anyways , I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class , you should try to get him to excel in something . 	0
Anything , it can be his favorite school subject ( in my case , math ) , an instrument ( piano ) , or something else he likes ( in my case , ballet ) . 	0
This is Poppycock ! 	0
It ' s the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs . 	0
But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education . 	0
If Mom and Dad feel they are equipped to home school their children , so be it . 	0
remember , keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don ' t like is a moral crime . 	0
Well this has been fun but I have to go back to work . 	0
Have a nice day . 	0
No wonder Hurricane Katrina smote New Orleans just before a gay rally ! 	0
No wonder hundreds of earthquakes have popped up in ‘ divers places ’ . 	0
THink About it ! 	0
No wonder our economy is nose-diving ! 	0
It is just another sign of moral / spiritual decay of the American . 	0
Prayer being removed from school is just the leading indicator of a nation that is ‘ Falling Away ’ from Jehovah . 	0
No wonder 50 million babies have been aborted since 1973 . 	0
And the disasters we see today are simply God ’ s finger writing on the wall : Mene , mene , Tekel , Upharsin ; that is , God has weighed America in the balances , and we ’ ve been found wanting . 	0
We can ignore Him or listen to Him . 	0
God ’ s speaking to us . 	0
Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues . 	0
We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference . 	0
So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue . 	0
Hence , I switched to Private . . . . 	0
That ' s still a baby ! 	0
But I think I ' ll just keep him with me until SK and then let him go . 	0
Why is it called redshirting , I wonder ? 	0
My son was born in December ( cut-off Dec . 31 ) and I have been a little worried for him because they would want him to start JK when he ' s only 3 ! 	0
( physically he ' s an ox , takes after my side of the family ! ) 	0
Besides , you need to think of the kid ' s future . 	0
I ' m not pleased with the full-day kindergarten coming in , but I ' ll worry about that when it gets closer . 	0
( he ' s 2 now ) I thought of holding him back , but my husband was always bored in school and so if he ' s smart like his daddy it might actually work out very well for him to be a bit younger than the other kids . 	0
If all the others are graduating high school at 17 , why does he need to be there until he ' s 18 ? 	0
His whole life is delayed by a year . 	0
My In our state , we have one of the youngest start ages ( 5 by Dec 31st ) . 	0
I think it ' s a desperate shame - the poor kid is being deprived of an education and the opportunity to mix with other children . 	0
Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games , and 1 / 2 the class did not speak English , in the same class ! 	0

lurker here . . there is only mainstreaming where I live in Canada . . ALL special needs not matter what the handicap is . . or how severe go into regualr classes . . they do go to assisted learning classes for about 1 hr / day to get help w / reading etc . . this works awesome ! ! . . 	1
I have a HF autistic son w / severe ADHD . . he is doing awesome in grade 1 he has a 1 on 1 aide in the class . . we feel well supported by the school system and he has only 18 in his class ! 	0
Having sent my children to both public and private schools , I prefer private schools . 	1
I say " NOT " ! 	0
I think it is a very loving thing , a good and decent thing to send children to a private school ! 	1
Give Me A Break ! 	0
Bad people . . . 	0
This statement . . . “ There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school , ” Benedikt wrote . . . . is absolutely a lie ! 	0
You say she has a compelling argument . . . 	0
I know we all have to work extra hard to keep these private schools running and that is also teaching our children persistence . . . and how to care for one another without depending on Uncle Sam to come in and pick up the pieces . . . are you kidding me by judging all parents who know and believe in a Higher Power than themselves . . . now that is a refreshing statement for Ms . Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children . 	0
I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are " bad " and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character . . . how dare this person call us bad if we chose to use our private schools . . . as a parent of a terrific private school system . . . 	0
Do we still not live in the free United States of America ? ? ? 	0
Private schools , producing more 1-dimensional bigots with an overblown sense of self-entitlement than any other education option . . . #Rex , Of which most of them become either lawyers or politicians . 	0
Test scores would be an astoundingly poor way to judge the merits of single-sex education anyway . 	0
I went to school with boys but somehow I managed to see myself as a human being and to retain higher goals than being pretty . 	0
Succeeding in life is the goal . 	0
Testing well is not the goal . 	0
Maybe half of boys and half of girls would do better in a competitive atmosphere , and the same in a collaborative one . 	0
Even if it were a good idea to separate children by learning style , one could not reasonably infer a child ' s learning style from their genitalia . 	0
To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don ' t invest time in being sexually desirable to men , I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don ' t see themselves as sex objects , rather than designing institutions that say , " we think you can ' t learn around boys because you would have to spend so much time being a sex object . " 	0
But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation . 	0
Ms . Wong , Benedikt ' s reason is in no-way-shape-or-from compelling . 	0
It ' s a self confessed a manifesto . 	0
It requires a jaundiced eye . 	0
While I ' m all for public schools ; both our kids attend . 	1
Or being bested by her . 	0
I shudder to imagine the losses we ' d suffer in reducing the gender gap in the remaining boys ' clubs like engineering and high level business management if women had to deal with men who had never in their lives had the experience of cooperating with a woman . 	0
American parents have never given up their right to find the best solution for their child nor should they . 	0
In the grey world , it ' s perfectly possible to believe-in and support public school but choose a private school for your student . 	0
She may be advanced academically , but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that , maturity-wise . 	0
The school is having her wait , and I am 100% fine with that . 	0
If a young five is already reading and doing basic math , they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year . 	0
That ' s what we are doing . 	0
She can keep doing her thing at home another year , and do half day preschool . 	0
They will find ways to challenge her , the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels . 	0
Is the government supposed to say , OK , we just abandon home-educated kids to the whims of their parents ? 	0
I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school . 	1
Okay , if I had children now they would go to private school . 	1
I am a police officer and work part time at a private school and the attitude there is totally different . 	0
The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun . 	0
If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there , we are arresting someone . 	0
That ' s not a favour , in my opinion . 	0
: P ( surely you don ' t get marks in Kindergarten ? 	0
I have no idea . ) 	0
Now I am extremely confident and star in theatre performances , school choir , am going to take ABRSM Grade 7 for Piano , perfected the AMC 8 , and am taking Pre-Calculus . 	0
So what about being a year older than my classmates ? 	0
I think you should “ redshirt ” your son , no offense . 	1
I am a 12-year-old 6th grader turning 13 in May , so I know what it ’ s like . 	0
Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision : In preschool , I had some issues , just like your son . 	0
Yes , I knew my ABCs since 2 , just like him . 	0
I feel socially confident now , and feel great ( except when I got 91 . 5 / 150 on AMC 10 and 76 . 5 / 150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself ) . 	0
Being at the top of the class is awesome . 	0
I ' ll make sure to remind the teacher of his tender years if he starts getting poor marks for " scissoring skills " . 	0
If you in Cape Town and your child loves playing cricket , send him to Wynberg boys high ! 	0
what a terrific school it is ! 	0
There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college . 	0
The life lessons learned from interacting with the opposite sex would be the winner for me . 	0
So in Columbus , Ohio if you can ' t afford private school move to the suburbs . 	0
Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good . 	0
Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger . 	0
I wish I had moved sooner , but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone . 	0
I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers ( not to brag , but you know what I mean ) . 	0
However , I was behind socially ; I couldn ’ t stand up for myself without swearing ( actually using the f-word and such ) , I refused to ask for help , so I was redshirted . 	0
Intentionally and explicitly working to turn out strong , capable , assertive women , Ellis--its heritage , its excellent teachers , and its visionary leadership--is all about helping girls find and build on their strengths and passions . 	0
Ellis makes no apologies for its commitment to the growth of girls and young women as a single-sex school , and its palpable ethos had me wishing I had a daughter to send there . 	0
Although Im pretty sure someone will scream about how dare I assume they ' re abusive etc . . . 	0
But you either have some checking of child welfare or none . 	0
I ' ve obviously not got the answers ! 	0
Most boys ' schools have long since stopped selling themselves as bastions of male hegemony and cut-it-with-a-knife testosterone culture . 	0
The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels . 	0
The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues . 	0
I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids . 	0
I held her back . 	0
My daughter was born on the cut off date . 	0
There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year ( March ) are more successful in life due to the age gap . 	0
This was promising to see . 	0
Another promising skill I saw was when he was stuck on a word , he remembered he wrote it previously and therefore looked back at the word to help him spell it again . 	0
He wanted all the action to start at the beginning and with all his ideas the characters were being sent in every direction possible . 	0
However , he had no idea how to start the beginning of his narrative and what the structure of a narrative is , with the orientation beginning the narrative and the complication following . 	0
This is quite interesting as it demonstrates that he is still at that level of a kindergarten / yr 1 student , being able to verbally produce a sentence however , not write it down exactly . 	0
From this , even though his structuring was slightly off track he was able to verbally produce some great sentences however , forgot them for when he had to write them down . 	0
I thought I would add this piece in to help develop an understanding of the difficulties one child has and the significant disadvantage he has academically . 	0
As previously mentioned in my last blog ( Weekly reflection 2 ) I was working individually with a child with significant learning difficulties . 	0
What I did notice whilst I was working with him was that at first he had absolutely no idea of what to write and me not knowing the movie did not help either but once I asked him to retell me what happened in the movie and started giving him some ideas he thought of his own and from there had some great ideas . 	0
He spends a lot of time out of class with the special education teachers receiving one on one work but missing out on other important activities . 	0
always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school . 	0
private schools will always be around . 	0
if you can ' t teach then someone will take notice . 	0
I also agree God should have never came out of the schools . 	0
if they can ' t provide , you can ' t teach . 	0
If you can afford to send your kids to private schools do . 	1
My son went to Columbus Public Schools , in Columbus , Ohio and they treated him and myself badly . 	0
I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education . 	0
It made no difference . 	0
They didn ' t want my help or my commitment to the school . 	0
I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement . 	0
if you don ' t like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders . 	0
don ' t try to make parents feel guilty about it . 	0
it is what it is . 	0
In 2013 , the world is decidedly different , and the battles are far less obscure . 	0
Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat " rape culture , " and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development . 	0
I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment , stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder , and so my summers there were a revelation . 	0
Not the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp , members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists , were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing , biking , swimming , and lots of group activities--as leadership development . 	0
I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to , and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm . 	0
The task of female role models and mentors was changing , and the staff was up to the work . 	0
I also discovered what " collaborative leadership " meant , as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic , just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television , movies , and high school . 	0
If summers found me in a land of strong and independent women , my first three teaching jobs ( my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment ) were back in a man ' s world . 	0
I think many of my generation of male teachers , with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution , had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood , and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies ; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys , we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear . 	0
I don ' t know how well it worked , but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution . 	0
I wouldn ' t send my dog to public schools in Florida . 	1
I rose up to make changes . . . rose up to my feet and walked my family the hell out of a corrupt , unsafe , government battle ground and into the Private Catholic school system . 	0
After all , it ’ s usually the parents who rise up to make changes to the system . . " 	0

If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level , you are guilty of child abuse . 	0
I am sorry , I am a hardliner on this . 	0
All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old . 	0
You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty , opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential . 	0
I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour . . . i went to rondebosch , sacs / sax ( forgot ) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember model c or private school is your best bet ! 	1
make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics . . . everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby 	0
If the child has support throughout all of his schooling life , I see why not . 	1
So the question is … should a child who has such significant learning difficulties be in a mainstream classroom ? 	1
I do believe that all students have the right to a good education and although this child is at a low academic level , he still participates in class when prompted and the other students in the class still communicate and play with him even though he is significantly behind academically . 	0
He has no behaviour problems and no physical demands that will affect other students in the classroom . 	0
He still has one on one time with the special education teacher and is receiving great help from his class teacher now and from his peers . 	0
If this child was to be in a special school / support unit the social skills he has now would be diminished and he may be at an even lower level than he is now as there are more interruptions than in a mainstream class . 	0
When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
For a critical mass families and kids , some period of single-sex education is part of a path toward an adulthood informed in positive ways by an understanding of both the differences between the sexes and the ways in which we are all bound by our shared and very human anxieties , aspirations , and capacities . 	0
All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$ ! 	0
I ' m talking black , white , brown , asian , oriental , you name it they ' ve got it . 	0
So you won ' t get your undies in a bunch , the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum . 	0
That ' s unheard of in public schools . 	0
We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people . 	0
No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems . 	0
With a plethora of drugs and gang problems , public schools are the LAST place I would send my child ! 	1
I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions . 	0
Actually he ' s much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely . 	0
They get a better education and they are safer from acts of violence . 	0
Public schools have become more interested in political correctness than in education and there is too little control over violence . 	0
Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
Not a problem . 	0
I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
Same sex education works best for males . 	0
Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1
Whew ! 	0
Just know He will judge the wicked . 	0
~Freya Edholm 	0
you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0
teachers claim they are not paid enough . 	0
if that means sending them to private school , then so be it . 	0
no difference in home schooling . 	0
you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
you had to intern somewhere ? 	0
It ' s a crappy situation , and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case , because they ' re not even walking a thin line anymore , they ' re trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care . 	0
So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur ( the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority ) , and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day , a determined abuser will wait till the last minute . 	0
And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won ' t be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children , there will be someone somewhere who does , and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur . 	0
However . . . 	0
Removal of a child from established programs and situations ( such as state education ) will always raise a question mark in these times . 	0
why ? 	0
demand the school provide . 	0
Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time . 	0
Additionally , American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school . 	0
she is obviously a liberal . 	0
only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
people with money give more . 	0
simple as that . 	0
you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
Of course , turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark , but generally these things mean nothing in isolation ( an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark , but you ' ll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it ) . 	0

Boys were beastly enough without the distraction of girls , and the educational needs of girls were thought to diverge from those of boys even before puberty brought its complications . 	0
Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty . 	0
While the debate goes on about the legitimacy of single-sex classes and schools in the public sector , private and independent schools keep taking the concept to whole new levels . 	0
Once upon a time coeducation was unthinkable . 	0
As a kid I experienced both single-sex and coeducational schools . 	0
My public elementary school was coed , of course , and then I had six years of boys-only junior and senior high school . 	0
Plenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics . 	0
Public schools have been coed for a long time , and old schoolhouses with separate " Boys " and " Girls " entrances are quaint in a way that makes us shake our heads . 	0
Then followed a couple of years of all-male university , until we were happily rolled over by the tidal wave of vintage 1970 coeducation , leaving the president to figure out how to keep his promise that we ' d produce " a thousand male leaders " every year ; so was born the cramped room students call a " forced triple .
