Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
The best musicians tend to make the most money . 	0
Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0
Forget the obscene fact that Beyonce makes about 200 times what the concertmaster for the New York Philharmonic does , they both do quite well when compared to the average piano teacher who gives lessons through the Jewish Community Center or the YMCA . 	0
The best accountants tend to make the most money . 	0
The best writers — business and entertainment — tend to make the most money . 	0
Now I ’ m not saying that Alex Rodriguez deserves to make more money than Miguel Cabrera , but that they and every other professional ball player make a lot more money than minor leaguers , those in foreign leagues , semi-pros and beer league softballers . 	0
The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead . 	1

Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1
My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children ' s education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system . . 	0
I have a few acquaintances who couldn ' t manage to teach successfully at public high schools in Western Sydney and went to the private system for a relatively easy life . 	0

The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0

For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0
We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
She may not learn as much or be as challenged , but take a deep breath and live with that . 	0

Well last night I caught 60 Minutes ' rebroadcast of Redshirting - Holding kids back from kindergarten , which I had missed back in March , and I was , once again , all in a huff . 	0
This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0
( Remember my rant last fall - Redshirting . 	0

What about tomorrow ? ) 	0
I ' ve said it before , and I ' ll say it again . 	0

Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0
I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have : 1 . 	0
Additionally , many homeschooling families belong to like-minded groups that meet regularly and participate in field trips . 	0
Why don ' t students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them ( e . g . Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0
Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group ? 	0
When does it end ? 	0
We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else . 	0

Doesn ’ t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
I get it : You want an exceptional arts program and computer animation and maybe even Mandarin . 	0
You want a cohesive educational philosophy . 	0
I asked them to tell me why . 	0
My daughter chose to attend public high school . 	0
In a school of 2 , 500 kids , less than 10% of the parents attended orientation . 	0
I sent my kids to a private , religious based school . 	0
I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives . 	0
Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0
Everyone went to orientation . 	0
I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0
Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child , you met with the teacher and / or the principle and worked out a solution . 	0
They never had any issues with bullying ( they had an anti-bullying program before it was popular ) . 	0
The best lawyers tend to make the most money . 	0
I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
I know which I respect more . 	0
Many others , however , persisted in the more difficult environment and added immense value to disadvantaged students . 	0
If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies – I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
With solemn oaths and binding contracts between individuals removed , the state eventually sits where God ought , and only the state ’ s cause is held valid . 	0
Gender segregation violates our Charter of Rights and Freedoms which , under Section 15 , prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race ; national or ethnic origin ; colour ; religion ; gender ; age ; and mental or physical disability . 	0
Muslim prayer is strictly segregated . 	0
Are gay Muslim students allowed ? 	0
Sexual orientation has recently been recognized as a prohibited ground for discrimination under the Charter . 	0
For the record I believe in live and let live . 	0
Some really good points have been expressed here . 	0
We ' ve heard about public school space being allotted to accommodate one religion and its demand for a dedicated space . 	0
Do what you like ( within the law ) , just don ' t impose it on anyone else . 	0
Are Christian students interested in learning more about Islam allowed ( silently and respectfully , of course , ( with their Bibles as a point of reference ? ) 	0
It ' s public space and if they aren ' t , why aren ' t they ? 	0
I highly recommend a co-ed school . 	1
Just getting rid of public schools isn ' t going to get rid of problem students and SOMEONE is going to have to deal with them . 	0
The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
Well , getting drunk before basketball games with kids who lived at the trailer park near my house did the same for me . 	0
Reading Walt Whitman in ninth grade changed the way you see the world ? 	0
As rotten as my school ’ s English , history , science , social studies , math , art , music , and language programs were , going to school with poor kids and rich kids , black kids and brown kids , smart kids and not-so-smart ones , kids with superconservative Christian parents and other upper-middle-class Jews like me was its own education and life preparation . 	0
Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without “ the best , ” so don ’ t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents did—enough to get involved . 	0
( Can you imagine ? ) 	0
They sent me there because that ’ s where we lived , and they weren ’ t too worried about it . 	0
By the way : My parents didn ’ t send me to this shoddy school because they believed in public ed . 	0
Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0
I ’ m not saying it ’ s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
I ’ m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
Rev . T . Robert Ingram records columnist Felix Morley ’ s shrewd observations on this 1961 ruling in his study , The World Under God ’ s Law . 	0
Jesus ’ teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that “ the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain ” ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
I know that there are some very competent and dedicated private school teachers , but in general , how could they outperform public school teachers , who make so much more money ? 	0
I know nothing about poetry , very little about art , and please don ’ t quiz me on the dates of the Civil War . 	0

Of course , we all know that bad parents exist . 	0
But typically , the state tends to make the worst parent of all , and I don ' t need its kinds of lessons . 	0
Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
Personally i ' d go co-ed . 	1
As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
I am all for the public school system . 	1
I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
It ’ s simple ! 	0
Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0

" Respect for all religions " ( the stated mandate ) sounds really good if you ' re a politician . 	0
Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
The results of the study don ’ t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics — datasets they call it — and came to the same conclusions . 	0
The Lubienskis aren ’ t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
Correct for these factors — in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree — and the public school wins hands down . 	0
It doesn ’ t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
And it doesn ’ t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0

Don ’ t just acknowledge your liberal guilt—listen to it . 	0
the teachers were not sufficiently trained to deal with him , we were constantly called to the school to sort it out ( when tbh we had no idea how either ! ) he was suspended more times than i remember and was only on half days ! 	0
forgot to add , my son was very disruptive and dangerous alot of the time in mainstream , because he couldn ' t cope . 	0
the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people ' s attitudes . . . it doesn ' t in my experience . . . they only did it to save money 	0
( which i ' ve later discovered is actually illegal ) . . . so no , it wasn ' t fair on the other kids . . . not fair on him either . 	0
These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
Here is the response that most stuck with me : “ In our upper-middle-class world , it is hard not to pay for something if you can and you think it will be good for your kid . ” 	0
In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
My six-year-old daughter is educated by me , at home . 	0
The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1

Whatever you think your children need—deserve—from their school experience , assume that the parents at the nearby public housing complex want the same . 	0

My high school didn ’ t offer AP classes , and in four years , I only had to read one book . 	0
Jesus ’ own expressed desire , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them ” was also violated by these judges , many of whom were raised in Christian homes . 	0
In Torcaso vs . Watkins , the court overruled a provision of the Maryland Constitution which made “ a declaration of belief in the existence of God ” mandatory for holding public office . 	0
A ruling in 1961 , I believe , paved the way for stripping the Lord ’ s name from our children ’ s lips . 	0
Roy R . Torcaso , a Maryland resident and an avowed atheist , was refused a notary public commission when he would not subscribe to the required oath . 	0
The Court ruled to sanction atheism and overruled the Maryland Constitution . 	0

It is the quality of teachers ' training , lessons , and classroom management practices — and not the sex of their students — that determines the quality of learning in their classrooms . 	0
Despite the debate , federal law supports the option of single-sex education in public schools . 	0
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon . 	0
In many underresourced schools , it ’ s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ’ s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
And parents have a lot of power . 	0
There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
More accountability for students and teachers . 	0
Naturally , if a school has the power to select and expel students at will , it ' s easier teaching there . 	0
There is no secret to the rise of private schools . 	0
More respect for students and teachers 3 . 	0
More resources 2 . 	0
There is pressure for all our pupils today in school – in fact far too much and too early . 	0
We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‘ whole ’ person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ’ s view that girls are not some ‘ alien creature ’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
So , how would this work exactly ? 	0

Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0
The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ” 	0
Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that “ God ’ s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0
We are living witnesses that truly “ the Lord does not hold such a nation guiltless . ” 	0
Your local school stinks but you don ’ t send your child there ? 	0
Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ’ schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
I have experience working in all boys ’ schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ’ school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0

Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
The “ evangelical prophet , ” Oswald Chambers ( 1874 – 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great “ spiritual leakage . ” 	0
I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0

Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
Oh , but she ’ s gifted ? 	0
I went K–12 to a terrible public school . 	0
Well , then , she ’ ll really be fine . 	0
You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ’ t need it . 	0
I understand . 	0
She will have support at home ( that ’ s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
There wasn ’ t even soccer . 	0
His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
Had I a daughter , I would encourage her to find single-sex schools . 	1
I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0
Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school ( maybe their " brother " school ) , guys from the train station , the arcade . 	0
Surely as a parent you ' d feel more OK knowing that your daughter was with someone she knew ? 	0
. 	0
. 	0
They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they ' ve just met – and not really knowing anything about them . 	0
you get my drift . 	0
And if they ' re not getting it at school , they ' ll get it elsewhere . 	0

As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers — virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business ’ disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
In the case of education , it ’ s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0
Nor was I surprised that the news media has ignored the Lubienski book . 	0
We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
Everyone , all in . 	0
( By the way : Banning private schools isn ’ t the answer . 	0
None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0

Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1

Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0
Sadly , my college chose to go co-ed years ago . 	0
It left a hole in my heart . 	0
