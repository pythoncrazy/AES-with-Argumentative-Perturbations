Will the Muslim clerics claim the right to punish girls that fail to sit at their rear during their period ? 	0
Isn ' t permitting Muslim prayer in public schools a significant step onto the slippery slope towards applying Sharia Law ? 	0
I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren ’ t allowed to pray in school anymore . 	0
There is a lot of heated rhetoric in the air these days regarding an alleged ban on prayer in the public schools . 	0
In recent blogs , I ’ ve been concerned with clearing up some common misconceptions relating to areas of interface ( sometimes involving significant controversy and conflict ) between religion and secular American culture . 	0
I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for " career " training at their " ability level . " 	0
The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
It is absolutely correct . 	0
Public schools have neither option . 	0
They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
Clearly we ’ re off to a great start . 	0
With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0

He ' s not very big and he ' s right in the middle of his class with school work . 	0
Any advantage he may have had in sports vanished as soon as the rest of the football team learned their right from their left . 	0
There ' s a real possibility that he would have been diagnosed with a disorder when his real problem was lack of maturity . 	0
It would have been a horrible struggle for him to start at age 5 , and he would have been held back anyway . 	0
The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive . 	0
Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn ' t have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare , particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls . 	0
They just aren ' t working right now , and I will not allow my child to suffer waiting for the entire system to be repaired . 	1
They have something to lose if they act a fool . 	0
The parents think of school as a free baby sitter . 	0
People who send their children to a private school are not “ bad ” people . 	0
They want the best for their kids ! 	0
I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids . 	0
The children in the private system , are polite , listen to what you are telling them and responsive . 	0
For the benefit of chidlren of course . 	0
I have had parents tell me , I gave birth , my job is over , it is your ( mine , the teachers , ect ) to raise and educate these kids . 	0
It stems from children having kids , forcing them off on the grandparents , and the children thinking that they mother is there sister . 	0
Pray on your own time . 	0
They do not belong . 	0
Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
No prayers in schools ! 	1
And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
I have a three year old , and if I have to take a second or third job , she will be going to a private school . 	1
This is the caliber of people we have in some schools in the public system . 	0
This fool was reinforcing bad behavior . 	0
When Ed Balls thinks about all those children growing up uncontaminated by all this his head must nearly explode . 	0
If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism , diversity , man-made climate change and sex education , even when their parents don ' t want it for them . 	0
The family are in the Old Bailey looking for compensation right now . 	0
Just because we ' re trying to provide something different for our children does not mean that we ' re simply giving up , or rejecting public schools all together . 	0
We live in a world of paedo-paranoia in which no-one can go within ten feet of a child unless they have been ISA Checked , CRB checked and chemically castrated . 	0
Back on topic , , , Of course the government are taking the action descibed . 	0
Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0

If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
It really is that simple . 	0
But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ’ s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
( They can ’ t even offer to lead purely “ voluntary ” prayers with an “ opt out ” option for non-praying students ; that ’ s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state — which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of “ the state . ” 	0
The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise “ establish ” religion ) . 	0
However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
It is sometimes objected that teachers ’ rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
Ideally , I don ’ t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
My neighbors that have been forced to put their child in private school this year do the same , most all of the homeschoolers that I know do the same . 	0
But the thing is that most of us aren ' t just sitting around doing nothing to help the system which we are backing out of . 	0
I plan to volunteer at the elementary school once DD is a bit older . 	0
However , voluntary , non-disruptive , silent prayer is fine . 	1

I ' ve gone to plenty of rallies in both Philly and Harrisburg to protest budget cuts , and to rally against things like the absurd amounts of standardized testing that schools now require . 	0
The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
The flaw . 	0
If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
This is not so . 	0
But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home , by parents . 	0
The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children . 	0
The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
This is because they want the children to know , there is a price for acting up . 	0
I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
They have to keep the numbers up , to keep the funds rolling in . 	0
He got sent to the office , and was out in 10 minutes , as he walked by me he smiled and said , “ I knew I could get away with punching an adult ” . 	0

In six years of going into schools to talk to children , I have only been hit once . 	0

There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
That in itself clearly does not transform schools into “ God-free zones ” ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0
Her year went really well too . 	0
It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
I went to an all boys school – Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0
In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school . 	0
So you can never tell . 	0
I feel strongly that I had a very good education , but my husband said his was lacking . 	0
Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we ’ d like . 	0
But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
Where ever the Muslims go , they expect " special " treatment . 	0
Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0
In order to keep everyone satisfied , there should be no religion in schools . 	1
No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
Firstly , we have not “ kicked God out of our schools . ” 	0
Students can ( and do ) . 	0
In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not “ kicked God out of our schools ” by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
So , schools are by no means “ prayer free zones ” — the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
Ten girls were shot ; five of them died . 	0
And shaming parents over it is only going to further the divide when it comes to schooling . 	0
These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs , and have their education ruined by undisciplined , uncontrolable , disruptive classmates . 	0
But here ’ s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
Thanks Mr . Trudeau ; you ' ve laid the goundwork that ' s the cause of making life in Canada a living hell . . . oh heck . . was that a religious inference ! ! ! ! ! ! 	0

Regardless of when they start school they will be edcuated for 13 years of their lives . 	0

Redshirting isn ' t just about your individual kid . 	0
Why do parents feel the need to push other parents to start their children younger ? 	0
I posted a study a few pages back . 	0
Studies show the practice ( when common ) has socioeconomic repurcissions down the line and can increase the HS drop out rate for lower-income kids who were not themselves redshirted as well as other disadvangates economically for society . 	0
There are lots of similar findings . 	0
I remember Joe telling me that the letter J looked " vaguely familiar " . 	0
One at a local school to me was nearly killed in a hammer attack the school were apparently scared to prevent for fear of being branded racist . 	0
Not only was he not beginning sounding out letters- he really didn ' t know what they were for ! 	0
Probably from a private school . 	0
I was surprised they could actually calculate that . 	0
So they left the cash on the counter , including tax . 	0
Once they were ready to pay for the items they wanted they realized no one seemed to be there . 	0
So the two people walked in to do their shopping . 	0

Honesty and morality in our youth . 	0
An example on the news yesterday covers yet another area that we are suffering with terrible . 	0
This is not the country of my youth . 	0
Why is it then when in our public schools we can ' t mention or refer to God in any manner ? 	0
These are just a few examples . 	0
When the President gives his State of the Union address , above his head are the words " In God We Trust " . 	0
The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states " this nation under God shall have a new freedom " , At the very top of the Washington monument are the words " praise be to God " , The inscription on the Jefferson Memorial " God who gives us life gives us liberty " . 	0
Look at all the references to God in our nations capital . 	0
This nation was founded " under God " ( the pledge of allegiance ) . 	0
I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives . 	0
I do support public schools with my taxes . 	0
It also says to not use God ' s name in vain . 	0
No self control at all . 	0
I will never let my kids go to public school unless the teachers can prove they can teach . 	1
what a bunch of hogwash . . . dekalb county schoold district in jacked up georgia is not worth pigs poop . . . as a matter of fact , almost all public schools in dekalb county is lower than whale dung . . . . teachers dont care . . . . I am all for Private Schools . 	1

Teachers pay should be based on performance . 	0
Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons ’ educational needs . 	0
My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
The bible says to pray in private . 	0
Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want " In God We Trust " on our money , and to not want " One nation under God " in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . 	0
Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are " better " than their public counterparts . 	0
Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
No religious activities in schools . 	1
The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
I ' m advocating for all citizens with kids who want to see the system thrive to actually take a stand and not just say , " meh , I like my particular circumstances , so I think things are fine . " 	0
Then politicians could see that they will not get away will cutting funding or creating rules that makes it unfair in anyway or any parent to have their child educated exactly how they want . 	0
Now , I ' m not necessarily advocating for the national government to take over regulating state boards of education , not at all . 	0
What is needed is full support of the public school system nationwide . 	0
In all states , not just a handful . 	0
I ' m involved within my community , helping to support our public schools . 	0
If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1
I ' m a teacher . 	0
I also don ' t think teachers / administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable . 	1
How long until Muslim schools girls are told to stop exposing their face in school ? 	0
Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
At least one child died . 	0
Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
They called 911 . 	0
They texted and tweeted . 	0
Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school – an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
It was a wise decision . 	0
But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools – people are not allowed to pray . 	0
Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
I have always gone to public schools and when I finished I got into University . 	0
I do not feel disadvantaged at all . 	0
In a private school , a student being expelled or suspended is not just one student out the door , its the rest of that students schooling life fees gone . 	0
Whereas in a public school , its just the student gone . 	0
Student who study in the private sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more than anyone would in a public school . 	0
And its all because of the money . 	0
The public schooling system is not as bad as some may think . 	1
Some mentioned that those who are educated in the public schools are less educated , well I actually think it would be in the reverse . 	0
You will soon understand the failings of the public school system . 	0
The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous . 	0
It ' s just embarrassing to see what the United States is becoming . 	0
Slate . com decided to take the helm with a piece by Allison Benedikt called “ If You Send Your Kid to Private School , You Are a Bad Person . ” 	0
We ’ re not even into the article and the judgements are flying . 	0
Or do you homeschool or unschool ? 	0
Regardless of what might work best for your own child and family , there is plenty of public opinion that will tell you that whatever you ’ ve decided is inherently wrong . 	0
Private ? 	0

What school do you send your child to ? 	0
Public ? 	0
This week , many kids , including my own , are headed back to school . 	0
And , like anything parenting-related , school brings along with it its own heaping pile of judgement . 	0
We are not number one in any single category . 	0
We are a second rate nation when it comes to education and while were ' at it we aren ' t exactly a shinning example of exemplary medicine either . 	0
All that would accomplish is further reducing the number of properly educated young people . 	0
Look at the world achievement rankings of our young people . 	0
No thanks . 	0
If you don ' t believe that they are as bad as I think they are , then you need only pay close attention when you ' re in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register . 	0
Truth be told College may not be in his future , but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there . 	0

We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
More over , they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended . 	0
I ’ ve often wondered – if God is good enough for the bad times , shouldn ’ t He be good enough for the good times ? 	0
Yet in times of great tragedy , school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they ’ ve expelled . 	0
Also , while academic standards were high , it was very much a ' survival of the fittest ' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter . 	0
We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also , surprisingly , stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing . 	0
So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
In fact , the Bill of Rights ’ First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one ’ s religion ) . 	0
Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
This is nonsense . 	0
Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it ’ s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn ’ t disruptive , of course — a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
Using Benedikt ’ s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1
And I totally understand Benedikt ’ s line of thinking . 	0
As private individuals , kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been ; in fact , their right to do so is constitutionally protected . 	0
Those who can afford to bail on trying to improve the system and end up sending their children to private school rather than work on improving public ones . 	0
It ’ s just that it has been widely recognized that it is clearly unconstitutional for the state ( and , by extension , state schools ) to officially sanction , sponsor , offer , or conduct prayers . 	0
But at least Benedikt acknowledges it : “ I ’ m just judgmental . 	0
She is on a scholarship I do not support home schooling , but for my niece and her children , it is working very good . 	1
I am a college professor . 	0
My sister schools all her grandchilden in higher mathematics . 	0
My niece ' s first born scored very high on the SAT ' s and is a second year student in engineering at a Florida school . 	0
Her mother , my sister , has a masters in mathematics . 	0
She was in charge of all math programs , k through 12 , for nationally recognized public schools in a surburban D . C . county . 	0
She was offered teaching fellowships from both departments and went on to get a her graduate in French . 	0
My niece is / has home schooled six of her children . 	0
She has undergraduate degrees in physics and French - graduate with a 4 . 0 from University of Maryland . 	0
But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . ” 	0
I am a former public high school social studies teacher . 	0
It ’ s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ’ s educators will never learn . 	0
One was the youngest in his class . 	0
Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated . 	0
I held him back because he couldn ' t sit still . for 2 minutes . 	0
The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
More students attending public school doesn ’ t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
Or … they ’ d be overcrowded . 	0
The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes — and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
The current formula for funding public schools doesn ’ t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
Overcrowding public schools isn ’ t going to solve anything . 	0
When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
Then there are the fees for education . 	0
On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
Most of those are private . 	0
Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school ’ s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
I have been a long term defender of public education - although fortunately have the advantage of living in a higher SES area where the public schools are relatively well resourced . 	0
Final lesson ? 	0
You ’ ll always be judged for pretty much any parenting decision , so figure out what works best for your family and go with it . 	0
Benedikt ’ s argument stands on shaky legs and seems fueled solely by judgement ( which she admits ) rather than exploring actual , attainable solutions for improving the public school system . 	0
But , this seems par for the course when it comes to the “ Mommy Wars ” : Instead of focusing on real solutions and changes in harmful infrastructure , judgement is tossed about like it will bring magical results ( beyond anger and defensiveness ) in its wake . 	0
The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent ’ s sign , that the children can be disciplined . 	0
I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed , they tell you that there school might not be right for you . 	0
