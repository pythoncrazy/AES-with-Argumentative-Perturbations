Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead . 	1
There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging “ between a man and his brother , ” much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0
If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
All affairs of life become subject to state , rather than individual control . 	0
Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
I have a few acquaintances who couldn ' t manage to teach successfully at public high schools in Western Sydney and went to the private system for a relatively easy life . 	0
Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as " religious " . 	0
Rev . Ingram documents and points out that “ a broad , organized attack reaching into high places is under way to remove the third commandment from legal standing in the United States and throughout the world . ” 	0
It ' s in danger of becoming one of those joke laws , like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester , and needs to be removed . 	0
However with my oldest if he were born a couple of months earlier I would have kept him back a year as he would not have been ready . 	0
tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
Our “ Yes ” should be “ Yes , ” and our “ No ” should mean “ No . ” 	0
Put them in junior workhouses ? 	0
And what are we supposed to do with the many children who have learning difficulties , behaviour problems or specific disabilities ? 	0
I ' m all right Jack . . . bugger you is a great attitude , especially for a teacher . 	0
If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
Once they start working , or going to college , they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in , and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old . 	0
It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world . 	0
Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy . 	0
They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith . 	0
I don ' t know about the rest of Virginia , but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools . 	1
The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some . 	0
Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
It ' s human nature . 	0
The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0
We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
If you promise to do a thing and don ’ t do it , it means the weakening of your moral nature . 	0
This is Poppycock ! 	0
It ' s the same as denying a sick child medicine because it offends the parents religious beliefs . 	0
But religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a kid devoid of a proper education . 	0
If Mom and Dad feel they are equipped to home school their children , so be it . 	0
I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have : 1 . 	0
Pray on your own time . 	0
They do not belong . 	0
Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
No prayers in schools ! 	1
Any parent , and I do mean any , that would do less for their children than they are able to are guilty of child abuse . 	0
Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues . 	0
We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference . 	0
So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue . 	0
Hence , I switched to Private . . . . 	0
I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games , and 1 / 2 the class did not speak English , in the same class ! 	0
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
I wish . 	0
No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
And so children die . 	0
If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
I know which I respect more . 	0
Many others , however , persisted in the more difficult environment and added immense value to disadvantaged students . 	0
I think it all depends on the childs individual development and personality . 	0
I am having the opposite with my youngest , he misses the cut of by 9days but I know will be ready . 	0
He will be 3 in July and will be going into the pre-school class at day care then because he is physically , emotionally and intelectually up to this level . 	0
So I am currently trying to get him assessed by the state board of education to enter pre-prep ( kindergarten in USA ) at school for next year . 	0
They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0
I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
With solemn oaths and binding contracts between individuals removed , the state eventually sits where God ought , and only the state ’ s cause is held valid . 	0
She is a genius and is knowledgeable in the arts and in the sciences . 	0
The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
The flaw . 	0
If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
This is not so . 	0
The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
Rev . T . Robert Ingram records columnist Felix Morley ’ s shrewd observations on this 1961 ruling in his study , The World Under God ’ s Law . 	0
Jesus ’ teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that “ the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain ” ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
This distinction is crucial . 	0
Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college . 	0
America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
Oh come on . 	0
Prayer is a frontal attack on the notion that mankind is in autonomous control of his own destiny and an insult to those who believe that friends , possessions , or power can bring meaning or joy . 	0
Jesus ’ own expressed desire , “ Let the little children come to Me , and do not forbid them ” was also violated by these judges , many of whom were raised in Christian homes . 	0
In Torcaso vs . Watkins , the court overruled a provision of the Maryland Constitution which made “ a declaration of belief in the existence of God ” mandatory for holding public office . 	0
A ruling in 1961 , I believe , paved the way for stripping the Lord ’ s name from our children ’ s lips . 	0
Roy R . Torcaso , a Maryland resident and an avowed atheist , was refused a notary public commission when he would not subscribe to the required oath . 	0
The Court ruled to sanction atheism and overruled the Maryland Constitution . 	0
It is the quality of teachers ' training , lessons , and classroom management practices — and not the sex of their students — that determines the quality of learning in their classrooms . 	0
Despite the debate , federal law supports the option of single-sex education in public schools . 	0
Why is it then when in our public schools we can ' t mention or refer to God in any manner ? 	0
These are just a few examples . 	0
When the President gives his State of the Union address , above his head are the words " In God We Trust " . 	0
The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states " this nation under God shall have a new freedom " , At the very top of the Washington monument are the words " praise be to God " , The inscription on the Jefferson Memorial " God who gives us life gives us liberty " . 	0
Look at all the references to God in our nations capital . 	0
This nation was founded " under God " ( the pledge of allegiance ) . 	0
I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives . 	0
I do support public schools with my taxes . 	0
A primary purpose of public education is to shape good citizens . 	0
Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
More accountability for students and teachers . 	0
Naturally , if a school has the power to select and expel students at will , it ' s easier teaching there . 	0
There is no secret to the rise of private schools . 	0
More respect for students and teachers 3 . 	0
More resources 2 . 	0
Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ” 	0
Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that “ God ’ s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0
We are living witnesses that truly “ the Lord does not hold such a nation guiltless . ” 	0
But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here . 	0
But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
It all depends on the person . 	0
I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
When I taught in NYC before NCLB , students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even . 	0
Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning . 	0
He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
The “ evangelical prophet , ” Oswald Chambers ( 1874 – 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great “ spiritual leakage . ” 	0
I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
That ' s my personal opinion . 	0
its gone . 	0
I don ' t think they should allow it personally in public school unless a child is tested delayed . 	1
She was fine , she ' s in 2nd now and fine and every few months the difference between her and her peers gets smaller and smaller and smaller . 	0
Until Poof ! 	0
I think there will be a backlash about this . 	0
I have a child who I sent to KG at age 4 , our cutoffs are December 1 . 	0
I ' m good with that . 	1
They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
I see no issue here . 	0
Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
This is just silliness . 	0
For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1
The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0
She is on a scholarship I do not support home schooling , but for my niece and her children , it is working very good . 	1
I am a college professor . 	0
My sister schools all her grandchilden in higher mathematics . 	0
My niece ' s first born scored very high on the SAT ' s and is a second year student in engineering at a Florida school . 	0
Her mother , my sister , has a masters in mathematics . 	0
She was in charge of all math programs , k through 12 , for nationally recognized public schools in a surburban D . C . county . 	0
She was offered teaching fellowships from both departments and went on to get a her graduate in French . 	0
The 2006 move was designed to give parents and school districts greater flexibility in selecting an environment best for individual students . 	0
My niece is / has home schooled six of her children . 	0
She has undergraduate degrees in physics and French - graduate with a 4 . 0 from University of Maryland . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
I didn ' t . 	0
Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
I had no idea . 	0
Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools 	0
That is why I am doing this , because of one of my classes . 	0
Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do . . . you shoulkd post some things for debate teams . 	1
I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
