But if prayer really works , then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God ’ s existence or His sovereignty over this world . 	0
I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0

Are we so weak minded ? 	0
Wow , here we go again . 	0
Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1

And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0

Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
Why ? 	0
My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0

It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as “ If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ” 	0
Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1

Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0

I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0

The theme of this year ’ s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0

So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0

( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0

I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0

Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0
What is this “ spontaneous eruption of religiosity ” that FFRF finds to be so threatening to students at public schools ? 	0
All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0

This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
We have done our share . 	0
Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0

It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0

Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
why ? 	0
demand the school provide . 	0
she is obviously a liberal . 	0
only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
people with money give more . 	0
simple as that . 	0
you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
