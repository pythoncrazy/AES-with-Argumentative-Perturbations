On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0
Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0
Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
I would look at the subjects on offer . 	0
Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
I would say to myself in frustration . 	0
“ This isn ’ t how the world is ! ” 	0
I had to get out , for the sake of my future ! 	0
For four long years , grades six through nine , I attended a rigid , traditional all-girls school . 	0
In 2013 , is single-sex education really the way to go ? 	1
Much more my style . 	0
tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
There should NOT be any praying in school . 	1
Praying is a home thing , or a church , temple , synagogue or what have you exercise . 	0
Prayer is not for public consumption . 	0
Our esteemed government should also change the words of the national anthem to eliminate the sentence that is a prayer . 	0
Canada is a secular nation . 	0
Let ' s keep it that way . 	0
Clearly we ’ re off to a great start . 	0
Just do what ' s best for your kids . 	0
Private schools don ' t promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles . 	0
Also , the private schools don ' t teach all of this anti American social justice crap . 	0
It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities , and that they can play on either team in sports , male or female . 	0
Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago . 	0
I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois . 	0
The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore . 	1
It ' s pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don ' t belong here . 	0
My kids didn ' t speak Spanish , so I pulled them out , and they went to private schools after that . 	0
Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
But then everyone is . 	0
But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down . 	0
The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive . 	0
When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing . 	0
Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church . 	0
Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn ' t have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare , particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls . 	0
I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0

How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional ? 	0
I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1
remember , keeping your kids away from knowledge that you don ' t like is a moral crime . 	0
Well this has been fun but I have to go back to work . 	0
Have a nice day . 	0
And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
However it may take a little while to really settle down to an “ absence of a rigid routine ” before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0
Greater Freedom “ The morning rush to catch the school bus … it all seems to belong to some distant world now , ” smiles Mariam , who has been homeschooling her only child for the past two years . 	0
I don ’ t know if any school can nourish her love for science as much as my husband and I do . ” 	0
She is my one and only and I want to go all out to nurture her interest . 	0
She simply loves doing what we do . 	0
We do science experiments , go on nature walks , explore the environment around us and create our own worksheets . 	0
“ My daughter Pat loves science . 	0
“ I find the homeschooling system very supportive of the child and his needs ” says Mariam , mother of a seven year old only child . 	0
( check if your state has any restrictive legal requirement in connection with this ) . 	0
And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
A new , and sound , study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive . 	0
So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
They can use tutors , courses , other home educating parents , older children , other specialists with other skills and knowledge , books , science kits , a bought curriculum , internet resources etc etc . Home education is for most a community enterprise . 	0
Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0
Having spent middle school – those really developmental years , around very few boys – talking to them became a major cause of stress . 	0
I clammed up and couldn ’ t put a sentence together . 	0
The cattiness , hierarchy and estrogen rages became a whole other issue . 	0
The cliques and gossip were unbearable . 	0
I love my guy friends ; they have made me a die-hard Lakers fan , and I appreciate them just as much as my closest girlfriends . 	0
Everyone needs a mix in their close-knit friend group . 	0
Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
I wish . 	0
No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
And so children die . 	0
If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
Others may differ , but I always think , isn ’ t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
My view on the subject is no . 	1
I was fortunately able to transfer to a progressive , co-ed , non-uniformed art school . 	0
Unless I was planning on going to an all-women ’ s college and then a convent , I felt like I was going to be unprepared for life if I stayed one second longer . 	0
I am happy to shop consignment stores and forego other luxuries such as vacations to give my kids the best possible education . 	0
We have shared one family car-a 7 year old Dodge mini-van and make many other financial sacrifices in order to make this possible for our children . 	0
We enjoy being part of a very involved and caring school community . 	0
We certainly are NOT wealthy , but we choose to send our children to a Catholic school where they can learn our faith as well as benefit from smaller class sizes and high academic expectations . 	1
The program provides the necessary leisure and opportunity to foster better ties with your child . 	0
This aspect of homeschooling program wins the greatest favor from parents of onlies . 	0
Confidence , self-esteem , pride , self respect are qualities that have to be nurtured by the school too and if the school fails in providing a conducive environment , the parents can take the next step of doing the schooling for their child on their own . 	0
Many parents of single children do worry about the adverse affect of wrong peer group at school on their child . 	0
“ I took my girl out when I found her constantly unhappy or bored at school . 	0
“ Girls , I feel , are more susceptible to peer pressure , teasing and bullying , ” says Vincent . 	0
Religious Freedom In many families , spiritual and religious beliefs are integral to their daily lives . 	0
Being on her own seems to do her a whole lot of good ” he concludes . 	0
Better bonding Understanding the child ’ s needs more closely and being available for them close by is the greatest advantage of homeschooling . 	0
Homeschooling is an option for those families who wish to nurture in their children their spiritual beliefs . 	0
With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money , hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform ! 	0
So bored ! 	0
I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0
They would be so bored . 	0
My kids would be bored to tears in Kindergarten if we waited a year . 	0
As it is they already enter Kindy grade level comfortable in 1st grade math / 1-2nd grade reading level . 	0
He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
One of my now close friends told me long after we met that when she initially saw my name and profession on our playgroup roster , she thought , “ oh great . ” 	0
*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0
Not all public schools suck , but most do . 	1
Some teachers need to be fired , some retired , and some need to change vocations . 	0
But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
Two years ago I was at a cocktail party and making friendly conversation with a group of women . 	0
This is one hot topic . 	0
Thankfully our child had to contend only with changing neighborhoods and not schools too . 	0
Since we were homeschooling our only child , we were able to give greater support to him during this time of upheaval and change . ” 	0
“ We have already moved thrice , across states in the past two years . 	0
It has been crazy . 	0
I love being with my only child in other capacities than just a mother , ” adds Mariam . 	0
“ It does not mean no work gets done ; only you take a longer time to explore what works for you and your child . 	0
Believe me , it can be a luxury . 	0
We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education , there isn ' t much parents can do . 	0
They re-route tax dollars to themselves . 	0
The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
Happens all the time . 	0
In addition , I don ' t like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school . 	0
I like knowing I have a say is what my children are learning . 	0
No parent would be able to change that in public school unless they are trying to get the school to be more liberal . 	0
A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0
They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
What will I do for Leo ? 	0
Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
The life lessons learned from interacting with the opposite sex would be the winner for me . 	0
I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
And shaming parents over it is only going to further the divide when it comes to schooling . 	0
Boys are also able to focus better during their puberity stages without the distraction of girls and the urges their hormones tend to trigger . 	0
Oh come on . 	0
But here ’ s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year , where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention . 	0
This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0
It is not just the very young children who benefit from the homeschooling program . 	0
“ Moving my adolescent into a home schooling program was the best decision ever , ” beams Julie . 	0
“ He was frustrated with the early waking hours , jibes from his friends about his weight , heavy homework schedules and lack of rest . 	0
Now three months into homeschooling and his rebelliousness and destructive behavior have reduced drastically , ” she concludes . 	0
While homeschooling does have its advantages , it has its downside too . 	0
Read on to find the negatives of home schooling your only child 	0
The emotion behind her statements threw me off a bit , but since that time I ’ ve been giving this topic a lot of thought , since it is clearly a topic about which many parents are thinking , are feeling strongly , and are looking for direction . 	0
I want to know when you are going to send your son to kindergarten ! ” 	0
When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school . 	0
private schools will always be around . 	0
if you can ' t teach then someone will take notice . 	0
if they can ' t provide , you can ' t teach . 	0
if you don ' t like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders . 	0
don ' t try to make parents feel guilty about it . 	0
it is what it is . 	0
This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
Choose Your Pace , Choose Your Subjects Your only child will have the educational freedom to choose what he wants to learn and in a pace that he finds comfortable . 	0
At the same time , the advantages of homeschooling attracted me a great deal , ” she says . 	0
I didn ’ t want to deny him that . 	0

Jessica , parent of an only child who wanted to homeschool her son , gathered a long list of pros and cons from her interactions with other parents who were homeschooling their children . 	0
They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college , universities and at work . 	0
It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0
The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year . 	0
Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0

People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
We have done our share . 	0
Boys tend to play and act up less when girls are not around , and they ' re less inclined to show off and seek attention . 	0
Girls on the other hand do not benfit as much from same sex schools as boys . 	0
Girls tend to achieve as well in both mixed and same sex environments . 	0
Not a problem . 	0
I can also speak from my experiences as qualified teacher and child psyc . 	0
Same sex education works best for males . 	0
Boys tend to obtain better grades and have less disciplinary issues in same sex schools . 	0
That said all the above are generalisations and atypical results , doesn ' t mean they apply or are relavent to your daughter . 	0
My personal opinion : If your daughter is on the fence about it , i personally would go for the co ed school assuming its facilities , teachers , and resources are equal to that of the same sex . 	1
The public school was a joke . 	1
When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0
Olivia . 	0
My friend Olivia is as sweet as can be . 	0
Which uniform style are YOU wearing ? 	0
Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan ’ s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0
EVERYONE had the same one ! 	0
All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls . 	0
Slate . com decided to take the helm with a piece by Allison Benedikt called “ If You Send Your Kid to Private School , You Are a Bad Person . ” 	0
We ’ re not even into the article and the judgements are flying . 	0
Or do you homeschool or unschool ? 	0
Regardless of what might work best for your own child and family , there is plenty of public opinion that will tell you that whatever you ’ ve decided is inherently wrong . 	0
Private ? 	0
Charter ? 	0
What school do you send your child to ? 	0
Public ? 	0
This week , many kids , including my own , are headed back to school . 	0
And , like anything parenting-related , school brings along with it its own heaping pile of judgement . 	0
It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0
The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0
you can demand all you want , but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too , then it ' s all for not . 	0
teachers claim they are not paid enough . 	0
if that means sending them to private school , then so be it . 	0
no difference in home schooling . 	0
you had to research it before you decided that would be your major ? 	0
you say you have to spend your own money for supplies . 	0
well , excuse me , but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher . 	0
you had to intern somewhere ? 	0
Also , while academic standards were high , it was very much a ' survival of the fittest ' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter . 	0
We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also , surprisingly , stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing . 	0
why ? 	0
demand the school provide . 	0
I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
Using Benedikt ’ s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
she is obviously a liberal . 	0
only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset . 	0
what she fails to recognize is , the more money you have , the more you give to charity . 	0
you donate your time , you give away clothing / shoes / coats to the needy , you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies , food banks , etc . 	0
people with money give more . 	0
simple as that . 	0
you don ' t need to take additional tax dollars to prove that . 	0
i live in an area ( Georgia ) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here . 	1
it is not safe , the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity . 	0
sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn ' t mean they are bad parents , it simply means they want more for their child . 	0
And I totally understand Benedikt ’ s line of thinking . 	0
Those who can afford to bail on trying to improve the system and end up sending their children to private school rather than work on improving public ones . 	0
But at least Benedikt acknowledges it : “ I ’ m just judgmental . 	0
But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . ” 	0
I am a former public high school social studies teacher . 	0
I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
Why wouldn ' t they ? 	0
More students attending public school doesn ’ t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
I went to both , public and private . 	0
The essential difference were the students . 	0
And it makes all the difference . 	0
I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
Or … they ’ d be overcrowded . 	0
The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes — and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
The current formula for funding public schools doesn ’ t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
Overcrowding public schools isn ’ t going to solve anything . 	0
So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
I am a single mother and I make less than most people , and I am sending my child to a private school . 	0
So I guess I am a bad person ! 	0
So I am suppose to sacrifice my child education , for the sake of the countries ? 	0
It was shitty prior to her birth or mine ? 	0
Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
I have been a long term defender of public education - although fortunately have the advantage of living in a higher SES area where the public schools are relatively well resourced . 	0
The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
Final lesson ? 	0
You ’ ll always be judged for pretty much any parenting decision , so figure out what works best for your family and go with it . 	0
Benedikt ’ s argument stands on shaky legs and seems fueled solely by judgement ( which she admits ) rather than exploring actual , attainable solutions for improving the public school system . 	0
But , this seems par for the course when it comes to the “ Mommy Wars ” : Instead of focusing on real solutions and changes in harmful infrastructure , judgement is tossed about like it will bring magical results ( beyond anger and defensiveness ) in its wake . 	0
Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable – and what I ’ m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
Isn ’ t that the fear of parents ? 	0
And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
I don ' t think we should pretend it couldn ' t happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is , in itself , highly damaging . 	0
