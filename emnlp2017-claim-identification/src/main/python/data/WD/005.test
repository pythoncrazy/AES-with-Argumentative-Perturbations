In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0

You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer . 	0
If schools would agree to this , then why not ? 	0
If we allow Christian students to pray , you must allow Wiccan students to pray , Jewish , Islamic , Muslim . 	0
You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols . 	0
Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality . 	0
I find them both rather frightening . 	0
De La Salle would have mixed results because although single-sex education does have its benefits to boys , there is no clear evidence that exists either way . 	0
Regina high school would benefit the most because their girls would have higher self-esteem and higher self-confidence in their learning abilities then they would at a coeducational school . 	0

Consideration must be given to the potential of a child to function as an adult , and the skills and behaviours needed to achieve this . 	0
Inclusion , where all children - regardless of ability - are educated together , has been debated for decades but special-needs education has not changed substantially . 	0
The debate is fundamentally a human rights issue , grounded in principles of normalisation , that all children should enjoy a non-segregated , unrestricted lifestyle with full access to culturally normative resources . 	0
Fortunately , my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time . 	0
That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent . 	0
Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0
This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies . 	0
It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0

*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with . " 	0
All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test , which identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity . 	0
These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ’ s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and “ too judgmental ” of their community and the world in general . 	0
President Theodore Roosevelt once said , “ To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ” 	0
This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the “ lack of social skills ” as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0

The data indicates that children born Jan . -April outperform both physically and academically than their peers born May-Dec . It indicates that those born June-Dec . should be held back from kindergarten a year . 	1

Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
Until that is done boys will be boys and do succeed in the coeducation environment while girls do not . 	0
Wow . 	0
Even when they beg this from you ? 	0
If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
Why ? 	0
They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0
Centres where students with special educational needs are truly incorporated , and valued , as part of a learning community that extends into the broader community . 	0
From this perspective , the overall design of the school space can be reconceptualised . 	0
Consider a school built around learning centres , where teams of specialist educators work together to support all learners to reach their potential . 	0
Incorporating a technology centre , where some students are developing ' ' apps ' ' while others are learning basic internet search techniques ; a literacy centre , where some engage in text analysis while others learn sight words ; an environmental centre , where some workshop sustainability issues while others learn how to use public transport ; and so on . 	0
Centres that do not exist solely to educate children from 9am to 3pm but , potentially , are used 24 hours a day and seen as essential community spaces . 	0
What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0

Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
She will still only be 18 when she graduates from high school . 	0
Our daughter barely made the age cut-off for kindergarten ( late summer birthday ) , but against our better judgement we started her anyway . 	0
A couple years later she continued to struggle behind her classmates . 	0
She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it , not just academically , but also socially . 	0
The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done , but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made . 	1
My son doesn ' t talk , so his classmates have asked to learn sign language . 	0

My 7-year-old son has autism , ADHD , and SID , and he is mainstreamed into a 1st grade classroom now . 	0
He isn ' t bored , and despite my greatest worries , the other kids are nice to him and he has friends . 	0
He was in special ed preschool for 2 years , and special ed kindergarten for one year , and he ' s doing so much better in his 1st grade class . 	0
His teacher brought in someone to teach some signs , so now everyone can communicate . 	0
I know because I was one of those kids . 	0
Many of these kids then go on to underachieve in middle and high school because their initial experiences left them bored and as a result , often totally disinterested in school . 	0
In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
In contrast , a homeschooler ’ s “ classroom ” is the world around him / her . 	0
Parents don ’ t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0
Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized . 	0
They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community , including churches , colleges , hospitals , fire departments , city halls , and even repair shops . 	0
Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
So bored ! 	0
I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0

Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
The writer is an idiot . 	0
As a responsible , rational , moral human being , I have a hierarchy of responsibility . 	0
I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others – ideals of Christian living . 	0
Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their “ socialization education ” from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
Expansion of the debate beyond special education to a general education and social issue would be useful . 	0
School and classroom design has not evolved and this has stagnated the inclusion movement . 	0
Advocates of a unified schooling system , where all resources and personnel are at one location , are on the right track . 	0
At present , intensive and focused teaching in a segregated classroom is more likely to result in acquisition of functional skills , particularly where learning experiences incorporate real-world exposure . 	0
However , inclusion in our education system is not automatically in the best interest of every child . 	1
I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1

@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0
Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0

I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0
In the non-public school , while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically , he is having behavior problems . 	0

@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0

The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0

Naturally , we were all excited by the school board action . 	0

We hoped someone would sue us so we could go all the way to the supreme court and get the old devil-inspired ruling reversed . 	0
