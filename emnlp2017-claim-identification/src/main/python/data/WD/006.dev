But Mrs . Cooper also has a more immediate reason for encouraging prayer . 	0

“ It shows the students that we understand they are spiritual beings . 	0
“ I ask the teachers to say a prayer at each assembly , ” says Principal Cooper . 	0
But prayer seems to be a de facto norm . 	0
But a school ’ s governing body – typically made up of parents , community members , and teachers – can approve the inclusion of certain religious practices , including prayers , if it feels those practices are in the school ’ s best interest . 	0
By law , South African public schools are not allowed to promote a particular faith . 	0
Two years ago , an instructor at COSAT was teaching students Arabic prayers , and sometimes asking them to recite the prayers in class . 	0
She ’ s Muslim , and she worries what would happen if she didn ’ t allow prayer at the school . 	0

Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0

Perhaps some Homeschool kids are ' awkward " and all that , but all the ones I know , are not . 	0
My friend and her family are Homeschoolers and they are all friendly and funny and wonderfully nice people . 	0
etc . . . . why would you put your child in that situation ? 	0
( No offense to anyone here , don ' t take this wrongly . ) 	0
My parents decided to Homeschool me ( and the rest of my siblings ) because they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools . 	0
All the drugs , swearing , bullying , condoms being handed out to young children who shouldn ' t even know what sex is yet , evolution . 	0

And what they are taught is directly against him . 	0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1JJW-JgHVac This film changed my perspective on public schools tremendously . 	0
Here is the preview . 	0
Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
But then everyone is . 	0
But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn ' t have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare , particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls . 	0
*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with . " 	0
Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have : 1 . 	0
I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
They can use tutors , courses , other home educating parents , older children , other specialists with other skills and knowledge , books , science kits , a bought curriculum , internet resources etc etc . Home education is for most a community enterprise . 	0
A twelfth-grader named Pumela also said she doesn ’ t care for the school prayer . 	0
“ I ’ m not really religious , ” she said , as she stepped out of sight of a teacher . 	0
“ I am not a Christian , ” said Mrs . Mohammed , an English teacher . 	0
“ And I don ’ t think we should do anything that promotes one religion over another . ” 	0
But not everyone is thrilled about the inclusion of prayer in school . 	1
Several teachers have voiced their dissatisfaction . 	0
Mrs . Cooper also invites parents to pray at the beginning of parent meetings . 	0
She says this gesture breaks down cultural barriers , and helps her gain acceptance in the community . 	0
“ I had to tell the teacher to stop , ” Mrs . Cooper said . 	0
“ I was worried the parents would think we were trying to convert their children to Islam – or trying to incite a jihad , ” she said , laughing . 	0
Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
Why would anyone write an article sighting that parents are " bad " for choosing private over public , let me guess , probably a progressive liberal who feels that ALL children need to be indoctrinated with garbage and forced sexuality that is not age appropriate . 	0
If I had school age children , they would not go to any public school . 	1
Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
I know which I respect more . 	0
Many others , however , persisted in the more difficult environment and added immense value to disadvantaged students . 	0

I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
Gender segregation violates our Charter of Rights and Freedoms which , under Section 15 , prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race ; national or ethnic origin ; colour ; religion ; gender ; age ; and mental or physical disability . 	0

Some really good points have been expressed here . 	0
We ' ve heard about public school space being allotted to accommodate one religion and its demand for a dedicated space . 	0
Do what you like ( within the law ) , just don ' t impose it on anyone else . 	0
Are Christian students interested in learning more about Islam allowed ( silently and respectfully , of course , ( with their Bibles as a point of reference ? ) 	0
It ' s public space and if they aren ' t , why aren ' t they ? 	0
That is the kind of thinking the Chinese and Indian culture is hoping you will continue so 	0
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
Lets see here . 	0
Hmmm . . . . 	0
As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
Here is my experience . 	0
There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1

The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
It ' s all good . 	0
Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0

The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
Yes , public school are overly populated , but they give students a chance to get an education . 	0
However , in private schools , the classes are smaller and there is more teacher to student communication . 	0
I believe that public are not a bad idea . 	0
Not everyone is economically stable enough to send their child to a private school . 	0
Honestly , if you can afford to put your child in a private school , by all means do so , but if you can ' t the other alternative is public schooling . 	1
Education is very important and as long as the child is learning something , thats all that matters 	0
More accountability for students and teachers . 	0
Naturally , if a school has the power to select and expel students at will , it ' s easier teaching there . 	0
There is no secret to the rise of private schools . 	0
More respect for students and teachers 3 . 	0

Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1

Miss Benidikt makes the statement that " you want the best for your child but your child doesn ' t need it " . 	0

The teachers from my experience , expect the students to teach themselves , they have more important thing to do like converse with their friends ( other staff ) , take care of personal business etc . Oh and now in Ca . , add the confusion of gender identity to the mix , where 98% of the students will be forced to accommodate less than 2% , causing many to be afraid of using school restrooms because now all any student has to say is " I feel like a boy / girl today so I want to use the opposite gender restroom today " and now preteen / teen boy can just walk into a girls HS locker room / shower any time he wants , even while girls are showering . 	0
Yes I took my son out of public school because I felt that the ( lack of ) education he was receiving was not up to standard . 	0
My future grandchildren will not go to public school . 	1
This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0

It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
Had I a daughter , I would encourage her to find single-sex schools . 	1
Education is far too important to let the government do it . 	0
It is wrong to send a child to government schools . 	1
The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0
A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts on the impact of Title IX beyond collegiate athletics and last week my colleague , Markus Gerke , wrote brilliantly about the myth of the boy crisis in education . 	0
Also , while academic standards were high , it was very much a ' survival of the fittest ' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter . 	0
In this post I will illustrate how Title IX proponents and believers in the boy crisis myth have come to clash over the topic of single-sex education . 	0
We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also , surprisingly , stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing . 	0
