But in general , I don ' t think I could ever be convinced that it ' s " wrong " for me to be anti-homeschool . 	0
It ' s an opinion . 	0
It ' s not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it ' s better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled . 	1
And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward , just that the overall " School " experience to me is very important for development of all children , and to me , that can ' t be entirely replicated at home . 	0
I have reasons behind it . 	0
Yes I do . 	0
Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids , religion , wanting to keep control on kids , special snowflake syndrome , etc ? 	0

One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0

We choose to be the primary influence in our children ’ s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0

dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0

There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0

I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0
The government doesn ' t have to intervene in everything . 	0
They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0

No parent puts their child in any school without great consideration . 	0
That ' s why public schools have ratings . 	0
That ' s why the school district is listed on real estate information . 	0
Take heed that when a parent chooses homeschool over public school , it was not without considering all the pros and cons on both sides . 	0
In the end , whether they chose one or the other , it was because they thought it was best for their child ! 	0
The stereotype that home learners spend their days isolated from society at kitchen tables with workbooks in hand could be nothing but farther from reality . 	0

This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , “ what about socialization ? ” 	0
A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0
My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1

Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0

there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
But , say a classmate has died . 	0
If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
I can see disallowing vocal prayer . 	1
A school is a public institution . 	0

The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
this was 1970 . 	0
Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
This is nuts . 	0
I went to a crappy high school . 	0
Each and every family has the right to evaluate their child or children and their needs . 	0
Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
Next year it may be public school . 	1
I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0

Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
This distinction is crucial . 	0
Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0
They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
Each school district is different . 	0
Each classroom environment is different . 	0
Each child is an individual . 	0
While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
Where will the child find the best role models , social circles , and friends ? 	0
8 ) How many denominations should it encompass ? 	0
7 ) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in , say , non-Catholic prayers ? 	0
Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
6 ) Children are impressionable . 	0
10 ) What if a child dissents ? 	0
This is costly . 	0
9 ) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers , one would have to hire ministers . 	0
Should there be separate prayers for Mormons , LDS , Muslims , Catholics , and Cult of Cthulhu adherents ? 	0

Education for life is not solely the job of teachers it starts at home in the child ' s earliest years . 	0
Parents should lead by example . 	0
Concerned active parental involvement . 	0
Those that constantly expect someone else to clean up their mess raise children that act the same , no personal responsibility . 	0
They are courted by the top colleges and prove their worth time and time again . 	0
Why ? 	0
The only reason the government cares about public education at all is the control and the potential revenue . 	0
What more proof “ free ” public education has failed , the highest test scores across the nation come from Home school kids . 	0
Once again " free " shows its worth . 	0
Parents that can afford to give their children better do which means you get a condensed group of non caring parents . 	0
Teach them yourself or take a lone and send them to private school but get your kids out of “ Free ” public education if you want them to ever succeed . 	1
For me , geometry was a nightmare and there wasn ' t a curriculum that worked for me . 	0
I have a daughter now , and after an awful lot of thinking and discussing , I feel she , like my sister , is well equipped for school ( emotionally , mentally and academically ) , I feel when she starts in September she will thrive . 	0
I would have failed without a doubt ! 	0
I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0
However , if I were to have another child , who knows , maybe if I feel he / she will benefit from being homeschooled that will most definitely be the road I go down . 	0
she is academically ahead of the curve , she is a social butterfly ( which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother ) , she didn ' t suffer for me deciding that i was very capable , tyvm , of teaching her myself , and that " socializing " at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers . 	0
she was allowed to " just be a kid " until she started school at 5 , and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to " just be a kid " . 	0
Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0

Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor . 	0
And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit . 	0
Where there is a will there is a way . 	0
There are grants that can be available too . 	0
That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
This is not about real " choice " . 	0
When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
That ' s my personal opinion . 	0
its gone . 	0
I don ' t think they should allow it personally in public school unless a child is tested delayed . 	1
She was fine , she ' s in 2nd now and fine and every few months the difference between her and her peers gets smaller and smaller and smaller . 	0
Until Poof ! 	0
I think there will be a backlash about this . 	0
I have a child who I sent to KG at age 4 , our cutoffs are December 1 . 	0
How many home educated children do you hear of that have ASBO ’ s ? 	0
How many home educated children to you hear of committing suicide ? 	0
@ calminthestorm . 	0
I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
Writers have a responsibility to be unbiased . 	0
Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA . 	0
I send my son to a Catholic School and last year I saw what they were doing . 	0
Far better than when I was at that grade and far better than the local public school . 	0
This writer is not thinking . 	0
We all want our children to get a good education . 	0
However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0
Now she ' s in 7th grade , and still at the top of her class . 	0
Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
1 ) There ' s no reason to suspect it matters . 	0
Usually not . 	0
The public school classroom may be one of the few . 	0
No . 	0
Social outings ? 	0
No . 	0
Church ? 	0
Where else in life do we spend such a large amount of time with only a group of people all the same age ? 	0
In the workforce ? 	0
Wouldn ’ t this be considered social opportunities ? 	0
Think about kids in the public school classroom spending six to seven hours of their day with a group of only their same-aged peers . 	0
In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , “ The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ” 	0
No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
I mean why not ? 	0
I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
I didn ' t . 	0
Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
I had no idea . 	0
Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
Done ! 	0
