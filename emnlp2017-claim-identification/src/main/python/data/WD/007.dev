You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer . 	0
If schools would agree to this , then why not ? 	0
If we allow Christian students to pray , you must allow Wiccan students to pray , Jewish , Islamic , Muslim . 	0
You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols . 	0
Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren ’ t allowed to pray in school anymore . 	0
There is a lot of heated rhetoric in the air these days regarding an alleged ban on prayer in the public schools . 	0
In recent blogs , I ’ ve been concerned with clearing up some common misconceptions relating to areas of interface ( sometimes involving significant controversy and conflict ) between religion and secular American culture . 	0
And We are going to do everything in our power to follow that conviction . 	0
I have a responsibility to my Child to do the best I can for her and sending her to the public school system to be endoctronated into the " moral standards " ( or lack there of ) that the Government standards dictate is NOT what is best for her . 	0
I could care less if she thinks I am a bad parent . 	0
I just wanted to present a much more common iteration . 	0
I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools . 	1
And as a public school teacher I ' m well aware of those problems . 	0
This is bat insane ? 	0
Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if " everyone does it " that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education ! ! ! 	0
No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the " greater good " if at all possible . 	0
This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0
Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same . 	0
I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school ( one that I had done a lot of background checking into first ) . 	0
Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0
There ' s no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today ' s times . 	1
The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways . 	0
The neighboring county public schools are the same . 	0
The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive . 	0
They just aren ' t working right now , and I will not allow my child to suffer waiting for the entire system to be repaired . 	1
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
Pray on your own time . 	0
They do not belong . 	0
Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
No prayers in schools ! 	1
And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
Just because we ' re trying to provide something different for our children does not mean that we ' re simply giving up , or rejecting public schools all together . 	0
I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0
She was ready , I sent her . 	0
I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
Comes up in conversation ? 	0
I don ' t hide it . 	0
" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0
It ' s our deal . 	0
Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
It ' s not . 	0
4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
It really is that simple . 	0
But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ’ s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
( They can ’ t even offer to lead purely “ voluntary ” prayers with an “ opt out ” option for non-praying students ; that ’ s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state — which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of “ the state . ” 	0
The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise “ establish ” religion ) . 	0
However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
It is sometimes objected that teachers ’ rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
My neighbors that have been forced to put their child in private school this year do the same , most all of the homeschoolers that I know do the same . 	0
But the thing is that most of us aren ' t just sitting around doing nothing to help the system which we are backing out of . 	0
I am a victim of this latter possibility . 	0
Believe me , I ' m still trying to repair the damage . 	0
I plan to volunteer at the elementary school once DD is a bit older . 	0
If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
Gender segregation violates our Charter of Rights and Freedoms which , under Section 15 , prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race ; national or ethnic origin ; colour ; religion ; gender ; age ; and mental or physical disability . 	0
Muslim prayer is strictly segregated . 	0
Are gay Muslim students allowed ? 	0
Sexual orientation has recently been recognized as a prohibited ground for discrimination under the Charter . 	0
For the record I believe in live and let live . 	0
Some really good points have been expressed here . 	0
We ' ve heard about public school space being allotted to accommodate one religion and its demand for a dedicated space . 	0
Do what you like ( within the law ) , just don ' t impose it on anyone else . 	0
Are Christian students interested in learning more about Islam allowed ( silently and respectfully , of course , ( with their Bibles as a point of reference ? ) 	0
It ' s public space and if they aren ' t , why aren ' t they ? 	0
The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
I ' ve gone to plenty of rallies in both Philly and Harrisburg to protest budget cuts , and to rally against things like the absurd amounts of standardized testing that schools now require . 	0
She may be advanced academically , but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that , maturity-wise . 	0
The school is having her wait , and I am 100% fine with that . 	0
If a young five is already reading and doing basic math , they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year . 	0
That ' s what we are doing . 	0
She can keep doing her thing at home another year , and do half day preschool . 	0
They will find ways to challenge her , the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels . 	0
I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
Of course , we all know that bad parents exist . 	0
But typically , the state tends to make the worst parent of all , and I don ' t need its kinds of lessons . 	0
Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
That in itself clearly does not transform schools into “ God-free zones ” ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
I am all for the public school system . 	1
Hindu ? 	0
How about Sikh children ? 	0
Are the doors open to them also to observe Muslim rites taking advantage of publicly funded space ? 	0
Buddhists ? 	0
To what other religions that violate our Charter of Rights does this extend ? 	0
" Respect for all religions " ( the stated mandate ) sounds really good if you ' re a politician . 	0
Trust me , I know . 	0
First hand . 	0
Learn what ? 	0
The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
It ' s all good . 	0
Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
Firstly , we have not “ kicked God out of our schools . ” 	0
Students can ( and do ) . 	0
In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not “ kicked God out of our schools ” by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
So , schools are by no means “ prayer free zones ” — the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
Ten girls were shot ; five of them died . 	0
Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
I ' m not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she ' s not Mexican . 	0
8 ) How many denominations should it encompass ? 	0
This was a small town in Texas . 	0
7 ) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in , say , non-Catholic prayers ? 	0
Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
6 ) Children are impressionable . 	0
10 ) What if a child dissents ? 	0
My 10 year old is in a private school . 	0
This is costly . 	0
9 ) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers , one would have to hire ministers . 	0
Should there be separate prayers for Mormons , LDS , Muslims , Catholics , and Cult of Cthulhu adherents ? 	0
In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
My six-year-old daughter is educated by me , at home . 	0
The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
NO ! 	0
But I don ' t bring it up and it ' s " yeah , us too , so how is your dd liking her new music teacher ? " 	0
So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck , I don ' t think she realizes my kid is too . 	0
I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
It is the quality of teachers ' training , lessons , and classroom management practices — and not the sex of their students — that determines the quality of learning in their classrooms . 	0
Despite the debate , federal law supports the option of single-sex education in public schools . 	0
There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
If you can I would suggest Private schooling . 	1
Worked for us . 	0
I guess it depends on your child as well and the dynamics of your family ( boys / girls / both / number of kids ) . 	0
We have 2 boys and they are going to a boys only private school and we ' re thinking of sending them to a boys only High school as well . 	0
Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor . 	0
And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit . 	0
Where there is a will there is a way . 	0
There are grants that can be available too . 	0
I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
I ' m advocating for all citizens with kids who want to see the system thrive to actually take a stand and not just say , " meh , I like my particular circumstances , so I think things are fine . " 	0
Then politicians could see that they will not get away will cutting funding or creating rules that makes it unfair in anyway or any parent to have their child educated exactly how they want . 	0
Now , I ' m not necessarily advocating for the national government to take over regulating state boards of education , not at all . 	0
What is needed is full support of the public school system nationwide . 	0
In all states , not just a handful . 	0
I ' m involved within my community , helping to support our public schools . 	0
Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
Sandy 	0
It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
Truth be told College may not be in his future , but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there . 	0
It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0
We tried to mainstream him in kindergarten , but he had a hard time adjusting . 	0
My child was in " preschool handicapped " from age 2-5 . 	0
lf not , it can backfire on the child . 	0
l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream . 	0
We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
