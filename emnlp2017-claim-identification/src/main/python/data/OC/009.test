It ' s OK that you disagree , but your disagreement doesn ' t make conflicting points of view any less valid than your own . . . and the impression you give is that you take offense because people disagree with you . 	0
People pushing back is not making you a pariah . . . it ' s saying that many of us see value that you don ' t wish to see , and that many of us see love as a LOT more than just valuing someone else ' s well-being more than your own . . . or having a rough fuck . 	0

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0

Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0

In fact , one of the reasons it was not made clear what benefits would be included until today is they announced it before they even figured out what they could put in it . 	0

And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

Ian Anderson ' s passion for music has given us some incredible albums . 	0
Jim Henson ' s passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love . 	0
Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0
Nada . 	0
What does that " force " accomplish in the story ? 	0
Zilch . 	0

WTF ? 	0
Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0

The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1
