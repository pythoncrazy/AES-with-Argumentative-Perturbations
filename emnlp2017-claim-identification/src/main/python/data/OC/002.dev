Enh . . . given that part of the job of Holy Mother Church is to protect the common man from the influence of the Adversary , saying that he has taken control of leaders of the Church isn ' t exactly good CYA - particularly from the head of the folks in charge of recognizing and rebuking his manifestations . 	1

( On the flip side , I also know some men who ' ve been devastated by their girlfriends having abortions--and going " tough noogies sperm donor , you don ' t own her " is just not the answer I can give a close friend who ' s grieving because he thought he would be a father . ) 	0
I don ' t know an entirely good solution though . 	0
Obviously you can ' t allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy . 	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden . 	0
Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv . 	0
I ' m actually not sure about this issue . 	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life . 	0
But the idea of someone being forced to be a father doesn ' t make me happy either . 	0
Dammit . 	0
p . s . please send ti my undying love seeing as she doesn ' t seem to return it any longer ! 	0
Sell sell sell . 	1

isn ' t all that great and will soon disappear from view , you could use the money for something way better . 	0
That ' s just my opinion . 	0

Just . . . * HUGS * ^_~ 	0
so wait , you seriously dont think she ' s hot ? 	0
I once dated someone who looked a lot like her , and she was probably just about as crazy . 	0
she had a real Lifetime movie of the week vibe . 	0
It ' s kinda weird . 	0
I love how the Capri buildings are so fucking run down and ugly outside but the shit inside the hotel is actually really nice . 	0

The comic relief scruffy Cajun lightning bug and the Voodoo Shadow Man villian characters were overly broad . 	0
Overall , however , very well done : fun , some genuine laughs . 	1
mshollie and I enjoyed seeing " The Princess and the Frog " yesterday . 	0
As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0
The point is just that there already exist a bunch of federally funded agencies devoted to domestic intelligence gathering . 	0
I mean , I agree that it ' s not as bad of an idea as a centralized federal agency . 	0

Though , that doesn ' t mean that I do not sometimes find a lovely being who does make me stare and drool and stare . 	0
Being a being who has spent a good deal of her life interacting with the world through books , writing , and the internet , physicality means very little in my interest of someone . 	0
But , the answer is very personal to me . 	0
Brilliant and ugly , hands down . 	0
I really could not abide much time at all interacting with someone who was unintelligent . 	0
Also , it is a very interesting experience that when one is in love , the object of one ' s love inevitably becomes more physically attractive and handsome / beautiful , and as well , sometimes reshapes my idea of what is physically attractive . 	0
let me know if you ' re interested . . . i haven ' t been to one yet , but they seem fun from the photos ! 	0

No , a pregnant woman doesn ' t need a man , but she kinda does need ( or at least massively benefit from ) the time and money contributions of a second person . 	0
I just can ' t think of a pat and equitable solution under that constraint . 	0

It isn ' t like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it ' s an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country . 	0
After all , it ' s a New World Order they ' re aiming for . 	0

Is that the same ire and frustration and outrage over " UNFAIR ADVANTAGE " re : Affirmative Action is hardly ever expressed or articulated when the children of rich , white donors seem to have little problem getting into the school of their choice . 	0

Intelligence and beauty are certainly plusses , but when it comes right down to it , what I ' m really looking for is someone who ' s kind , honest , sincere , trustworthy , loyal , and who loves me . 	0

Except if they were both jerks , in which case I ' d stay single . 	0
The problem isn ' t really that I can ' t fake it ( although sometimes I can ' t ) , it ' s more that it leaves me absolutely exhausted and loathing my job . 	0

I really don ' t know what the RA could have done about that , but it was very irritating , and brought about many passive-aggressive notes stuck on fridge with magnets . 	0
this year my main concerns are structural ( size of room , will the stairs make me tired , where is the kitchen , TV , laundry etc . ) and not related to RAs that I can figure . 	0
She didn ' t just copy and paste in info or messages , but started out with nice words about whatever time of the semester it was and then got to the purpose of writing . 	0
she also would say hello sometimes , ask how we were doing , but I never felt like I was being detained when I was trying to get something else done ( like walking by and getting sucked in . . . which is a common dorm problem in general . ) probably the worst thing that happened on my hall last year was that people were constantly getting their food stolen from the fridge . 	0
a little reassurance about that would be good . 	0
also , make sure all policies about bathrooms ( if there are any ) , visitors , getting furniture repaired , basic yet useful stuff like that , is very clear from the beginning . 	1
I hope it ' s not too late , just going through the flist and this is one thing I can help on . last year ( when I was a freshman ) I was concerned about showers / bathrooms staying clean ! 	0
