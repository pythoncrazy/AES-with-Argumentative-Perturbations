Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0

Also , if you read Revelations backwards while shaking a box of Cheerios and spill them out on the kitchen table , they will form an ancient sigil that is the Devil ' s True Name as written in the Black Tongues . 	0
Not only will it bring about the apocalypse but you will also burn a nasty mark into your tabletop that will never stop smelling like cat urine and sulfur . 	0
One of the missus ' cats has kidney disease as well , but it ' s being kept in check for now . 	0

Speaking as a former FEAD ( Front end accessory Drive ) engineer , the belt was either worn or a pulley gave out . 	1
I can think of other reasons but they are less likely . 	0
It should not have done much damage to the car , but putting it back on takes some practice . 	0

Well , maybe it ' s something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points , and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect . 	1
So , there are apparently idiots in other places , but it ' s interesting that they ' re all in northern climes . 	0

No muffins or donuts or danish , please ! 	0
Of course I also sometimes like taking my rolls ( and tea and whatever else looked good at coffee hour ) outside to eat , if there is a place to gather there . 	0
Suffice it to say that I got sick of testing concrete products . 	0

Hmm . . . let me think . 	0
How would I change the story ? 	0
What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0
This story just kind of staggers around for a while then falls over . 	0
Oh dear . 	0
Looks that way to me . 	0

It was like she tried to throw up , but couldn ' t , and then she was breathing through her mouth really , really heavily . 	0
Long story short , our cat was having trouble breathing the other night . 	1
Before 6 o ' clock , Brian and I had to go in and say goodbye , because there is no treatment for feline leukemia . 	0
So before four o ' clock I took her in and the very nice vet doctor took some pretty digital x-rays which revealed she had fluid around her lungs . 	0
So I made an appointment for later in the afternoon . 	0
