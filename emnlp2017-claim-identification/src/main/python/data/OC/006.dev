The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U .

She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc . " 	0
" They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet ' s insecurity since the election of Bush , " she told La Presse . 	0

Not that I don ' t also learn lots in more pleasurable circumstances , but there ' s something about cutting the heart out of some asshat ' s argument with surgical precision and offering it to the Morrigan , all without overstepping the bounds of legitimate debate , that causes me to learn things about myself ( other than that I have a tongue like a scalpel , a taste for blood , and the quintessential feminist trait of Won ' t Shut Up ; that ' s not news ) . 	0

I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0

So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0

The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0

The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations . 	0
Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0
If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved . 	0
Yuck . 	0

At the Easter Show this year , I was walking through some shed thing waiting for the fashion parade to start , when I was accosted by a brush-wielding lady who proceeded to tell me how horribly pale I was looking , and how I needed colour ( please keep in mind I did have a full face of makeup on ) , and before I knew it she ' d planted me in a chair and started attacking me with her yucky blue brushes . 	0

clearly , republicans have the right to vote . 	0
i really don ' t care if you agree with me or not . 	0
i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

Almost as creepy as that Bachman woman saying that we need to investigate all of Congress to determine who ' s " pro-American " and who ' s " anti-American . " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buZURCblR1o Why , Sen . McCarthy , I didn ' t recognize you in the form of a congresswoman of Minnesota . 	0

Y ' know what offends me more than overtly sexist jerks ? 	1
I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

I ' ve only seen a couple of episodes of Castle , and so far I ' m ambivalent about it , but I am tickled to death that he was issued a bulletproof vest that says WRITER in place of the usual POLICE or FBI . 	0

It ' s like this , only brighter / a bit more neon and there are quite a few more colors : I have a whole booklet of it , and if you want it I ' ll send it to you . 	0

what i did with it was make this recipe for a sort of casserole / stratta ( i made this up , here is the recipe ) bottom layer of casserole dish : . . . grated parsnips with nutmug ( maybe about 6 little ones ) middle layer : maple sausage ( brown it first ) top layer : a savory bread pudding / stratta with the green onions and napa cabbage ( 3 or 4 cups crumbled bread , 2 cups whole milk , 1 / 2 cup butter , 4 eggs , salt , pepper , sauted onions and cabbage . . add as much as you want ) bake for 1 hour at 350 it was seriously delicious ! 	1

" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
Nevertheless , if I ' ve parsed this right , I ' m more radical than not . 	0
