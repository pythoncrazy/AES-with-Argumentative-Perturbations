as a person with a folklore degree , they ' re kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly can ' t recall which ) . 	0
really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were " created " so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them . 	0
they ' re really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo . 	0
they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1
all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth . 	0
it saddens me that folklore ' s basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness . 	0
in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much . 	0

I ' ve heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I don ' t see how it couldn ' t , but I ' m betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once . 	0
