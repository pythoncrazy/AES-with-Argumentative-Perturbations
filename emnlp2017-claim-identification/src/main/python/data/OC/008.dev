Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
I hear you more clearly . 	0
I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
Does that make any sense ? 	0
Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

THEN push your hair down carefully with either a wide toothed brush / comb or even your fingers cause that shit seriously turns your hair into hard candy . 	0

as a person with a folklore degree , they ' re kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly can ' t recall which ) . 	0
really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were " created " so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them . 	0
they ' re really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo . 	0
they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1
all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth . 	0
it saddens me that folklore ' s basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness . 	0
in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much . 	0
