The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
Yes . 	1
Well , frankly ? 	0
The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

I do not prefer it , but by nature I am submissive , noncombative , noncompetitive , and relatively easygoing , which means I can pull it off and generally people describe me as easy to work with . 	0
Now granted , a job that wouldn ' t phase an extrovert will often suck me dry and I have to go home and do self-care for sometimes quite a while before I ' m recovered enough to handle the rest of my day , but I can do it . 	0

The whole point of the concept of a meme is that it was intended to describe the spontaneous spread of ideas and phenomena as if they were diseases or viruses that infect people unbidden . 	0
Okay , Internet , here ' s the deal : it ' s not a meme if you ' re asking people to do it . 	1
It ' s a rule ! 	0

basically you just need to look for the most ridiculous named big hair hairspray you can and it more than likely will keep your hair in place all night . 	0

I think things will pick up . 	1
People also don ' t like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two . 	0
It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let ' s face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) . 	1
I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout / background , user ID ) because of the slowness / lower number of hits on my auctions . 	0
This was a slow week right from the start . 	0
No . 	0

It ' s OK that you disagree , but your disagreement doesn ' t make conflicting points of view any less valid than your own . . . and the impression you give is that you take offense because people disagree with you . 	0
People pushing back is not making you a pariah . . . it ' s saying that many of us see value that you don ' t wish to see , and that many of us see love as a LOT more than just valuing someone else ' s well-being more than your own . . . or having a rough fuck . 	0

The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0

What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

After you kill Arthas , there ' s this long RP / cinematic where Bolvar Fordragon , whom Arthas had captured and tortured , took up the helm and sword and became the new Lich King so that Azeroth wouldn ' t go cablooey . 	0
The undead would overrun Azeroth otherwise without a leader ! 	0

i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
Omg , that is hilarious . 	0
. 	0
Shit , I should ' ve known that ! 	0
God damn . 	0
I ' ve heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I don ' t see how it couldn ' t , but I ' m betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once . 	0

Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1
I fucking love IHOP . 	1

The most frustrating thing about that game , to me , is that the random encounters are literally random . 	1

What happened to the Senate , however , shows that Republicans lost seats despite social conservatives having a larger majority of this year ' s vote . 	0
The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is . 	0
So , it actually shows that , at least in this election , running on a socially conservative platform was not enough to win the votes . 	1
( California and Florida both voted Obama . ) 	0

I generally proofread everything I do , so in retrospect I ' m not sure what I was thinking . 	1
gosh , that murakami exhibit at the brooklyn museum was awesome , wasn ' t it ? 	0
But if we do , there ' s an obligation to be careful where we point the thing . 	1
It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0
I like this one too . 	0

It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
Kid won , of course . ) 	0
( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep . 	1
He ' s been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure . 	0
He wasn ' t eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply wouldn ' t last . 	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came . 	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself . 	0
He was asleep in moments . 	0
The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat . 	0

They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0

You can still have all the societal disapproval ( once it turns out they ' re not JUST business partners . . . ) and the brutal death , etc . and so on . 	0
OK , so I ' m throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something . 	0
They don ' t have to be " gay " , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID . 	0
I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc . " 	0
Mother Nature : pain in the ass , or super-hot MILF ? 	0
" They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet ' s insecurity since the election of Bush , " she told La Presse . 	0
Full article . 	0
CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0
Both times I thought to myself , " Why are these old guys flirting with me ? " 	0
Then I realized that , in all likelihood , they are no more than 5 years older than me . 	0

In fact , one of the reasons it was not made clear what benefits would be included until today is they announced it before they even figured out what they could put in it . 	0
Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration ' s hate brief on DOMA . 	0

There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0
it hurts ) . 	0

But what about seasons 3-6 ? 	0
There are so many great people with intense ( good & bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and it ' s all pirate themed . 	0

Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

Speaking about it later , the subject turned to Tom Lehrer ' s parody of the Major General ' s Song , " The Elements " . 	0
We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0
However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer ' s pieces , I just have to decide which one . 	0
What Tom Lehrer song do you think I should sing ? 	0
Cece and I have been taking voice / singing lessons for a while now : She because she is in a chorus , and me just for fun . 	1
Anyway , our voice teacher held a recital the other week where each of his students performed . 	0
I sang " What a Wonderful World " ( made famous by Louis " Satchmo " Armstrong ) and " Modern Major General " from Gilbert and Sullivan ' s " The Pirates of Penzance " . 	0
I was a bit stressed out , not only for performing a demanding piece before an audience , but also because it was also the final week of School ( though I think I ended up doing pretty well ) . 	1

Pentax have tried to enter the digital market without really looking at what a camera needs to be worth having , and until they come up with soething far better than what I have used and seen from them so far , I would avoid spending money on one . 	0

I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0

I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we ' re screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out . 	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution . 	0
Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ? 	0
Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc . Yet , we ' re denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to " normal " people . 	0

I guess we ' ll never know now will we ? 	0
You see , the difference between you and I is that I have friends to talk to . 	0
Oh ! 	0
Did i say something about you or something that is none of your business ? 	0
Unless all you really are good at is gossip . 	0
Or better yet , i ' m sure you know my screen name . 	0
I dont need to make a journal to get attention . 	0
If you have something to say to me , say it to my face . 	0
I think the name alone is sufficient to cast suspicion upon it , 	0

All I can say is good luck , and you ' re in my prayers ! 	0
Daaaaaaaaamn . 	0

Yeah , I know . 	0

YOU NEED TO UPDATE ME ON INTERNETS TOO DAMN IT . 	0
Passion drove Van Gogh to ruin - while leaving amazing paintings in its wake . 	0
Passionate architects gave us buildings like the Eiffel Tower , the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building . 	0
But my main objection to the story seems to me to be this basic structural element - passion is a dynamic , driving force and in Brokeback Mountain it just . . . does nothing . 	0
Perhaps there ' s some personalization sneaking in here - I may not be entirely objective . 	0
oh he ' s cute 	0
Richard Powers is a brilliant writer , isn ' t he ? 	0

I did these a while ago , but I decided , what the hell , this ain ' t DA , what ' s the worst that could happen ? 	0
So what the hell , I finished it ! 	0
This I drew on OpenCanvas just ' cause when watching The Pagemaster ( Didn ' t bother to finish watching ) on YouTube , and TWR was just begging for internet trouble . 	0

I was typing in my e-mail , depending on gmail ' s autosave function to save it as I went . 	0
I spent most of my shift at work writing a paper . 	0
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 	0
Well , internet explorer just " encountered a problem and had to close " and it turns out gmail wasn ' t autosaving ( at least , not since 5pm when I had only a basic outline finished ) and my whole paper is gone . 	0
Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
Plain . 	0
Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
And there are many measures for that . 	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0
Their so HARSH . 	0
Oh man I LOVE those ladys . 	1
I can ' t believe some of the places they visit tho ; Hoarders baffle my mind . 	1
It isn ' t hopeless anywhere in the world . 	0
But it ' s a hell of a climb out of the grave they ' re making us think we ' re digging ourselves . 	0
Some are just more blatant and short-term about their despotic megalomania . 	0

It is beyond awesome that you are doing the art for this show . 	0
I especially love the guy throwing his mind out the window ( he lost his mind voluntarily ) . 	0
Also , the moon is often connected with insanity ( which you probably knew , based on this poem ) , so it fits together perfectly . 	0
Well , I agree . 	0
Those panels look GREAT ! 	0
Whatareyatalking about ? ? 	0
But it isn ' t any more hopeless than most of the rest of the world . 	1
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU i would have killed to see that . 	0
It isn ' t like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it ' s an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country . 	0
After all , it ' s a New World Order they ' re aiming for . 	0
Liable to be misused . 	1

i swear to god , the more and more that i learn the angrier i get . 	0
after watching an interview on lateline where a spokesman for the australian israeli jewish affair council explicitly said that if you question the actions of the israeli government then you are effectively anti-zionist and a card carrying member of hezzbollah . 	0
and all of this bullshit where they refuse to hold a temporary ceasefire to allow foreign national tourists to safely evactuate , as fucked up and shitty as that is , has me simply livid . 	0
what the fuck are they thinking ? 	0
i ' m so angry that i ' m shaking . 	0
i ' m so angry at them that i can ' t think straight . 	0
i bet you that they ' d fucking snap to like nervous fucking field mice in the eyes of a hungry hawk . 	0
and why the hell hasn ' t australia , or britian , or germany , or any other of america ' s allies got on the horn and said that if they don ' t force israel to hold a ceasefire then they ' ll pull of out their wonderfully conducted art of propaganda otherwise known as the war on terror ? 	1
how was the performance ? ? ? 	0
This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0
How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ? 	0

Don ' t worry about the e-mail ; I was only dropping you a-line because I figured you were bed ridden and in need of social e-mails = D Get some rest and feel better ! 	1
Why should they deny any rights to homosexuals from a few verses in the Bible ? 	1

Do you really think , if he wasn ' t there to do it , you wouldn ' t pick yourself up ? 	0
You don ' t really need someone to save you . 	0
But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there ' s no one to crawl into bed with you . 	0
That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0
Well , yeah , and the NSA too . 	0
Still , domestic intelligence ? 	0
Mocking the Catholic church at this stage in history is almost redundant . 	0

However , you can ' t do that with everyone . 	0
well being honest with some people is good . 	0
but since you don ' t like the " best friend " idea . 	0
I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0
Ermm . . . 	0
I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
Why ? 	0
Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1
I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it ' s really no big deal . 	0

Cakes , why do they all look like cakes ? 	0
It ’ s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts . 	0
True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
catalina = yes . 	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings . 	0
~13~ 	0
I think you ' re good with the honesty , but I agree with one of the posters above where sometimes it seems too confrontational and it could be taken too seriously . 	0
this isn ' t about good or bad . 	0
my subjective feeling is that a republican vote is harmful to this country . 	0
i never disputed that . 	0
clearly , republicans have the right to vote . 	0
i really don ' t care if you agree with me or not . 	0
i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0
If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
But , anyway , yeah . 	0
Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0

You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0

By your logic , the only people who can " legitimately " comment on the story / movie are bi shepherds who ' ve spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock . 	0
I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0

Hmm . . . let me think . 	0
How would I change the story ? 	0
sadly i have friends that have the knowledge to ruin me , just talking about things i ' ve done / said . 	0
i ' m afraid someone is going to reveal something terrible about me that only people i ' ve known for years know . 	0
What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0
This story just kind of staggers around for a while then falls over . 	0
I actually have no wish to kayak as I prefer rafting , which I do at least once a year . 	0
I was interested , as where there is kayaking , there is usually rafting . 	0

What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1

The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0

Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
thank you ! 	0
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
