I only started actually keeping track in October and I don ' t actually own most of the books I read , so I ' m sure I ' ve forgotten many , and a few from 2006 may have slipped onto the list . 	1

i recently visited SVA , and even though i ' ll be going to Parsons and not SVA , i really , really would recommend you go there . 	1
but my AIM is still up if you want to talk : letskillmichelle 	0
but the advantage SVA has is its ' faculty , internships , etc . the guarantee of a job , as opposed to Savannah . 	0

Not sure why I didnt try when I visited you haha 	0
I do not prefer it , but by nature I am submissive , noncombative , noncompetitive , and relatively easygoing , which means I can pull it off and generally people describe me as easy to work with . 	0
Now granted , a job that wouldn ' t phase an extrovert will often suck me dry and I have to go home and do self-care for sometimes quite a while before I ' m recovered enough to handle the rest of my day , but I can do it . 	0

I think things will pick up . 	1
People also don ' t like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two . 	0
It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let ' s face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) . 	1
I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout / background , user ID ) because of the slowness / lower number of hits on my auctions . 	0

The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0
It ' s going to be at Sin at Tottenham court Road ! 	0
b ) Robust ladies with crooked smiles c ) You basically own a bookstore , which is rad . 	0
And I disagree with Sean that you need light coming from the windows , because if it is that late most lights would be turned off , and places like the bar would have really dingy lighting anyway . 	1
Anyway , they are looking a little weird to me , especially the guy who is lying down . 	1

But . . 	0
I can understand not always agreeing with every parenting choice , cuz I mean , come on , there are so many options . 	1
I ' m sorry you had to go through this , and I ' m sorry she did as well . 	0
At least , in the end , she knew that people cared and that she was not alone . 	0
Oh man that realllly doesn ' t appeal to me . 	0
But thank you for the neato idea = D 	0
I went through the same thing with Cocoa , my ex-girlfriend ' s cat . 	0

After you kill Arthas , there ' s this long RP / cinematic where Bolvar Fordragon , whom Arthas had captured and tortured , took up the helm and sword and became the new Lich King so that Azeroth wouldn ' t go cablooey . 	0
The undead would overrun Azeroth otherwise without a leader ! 	0
: 3 But , according to the storyline in the expansion right now , there must be * a * lich king . 	0
Oh , it is . 	0
It was a very epic and fun ending ! 	0

We ' ve had a couple of similar incidents in a different part of Nova Scotia , where would-be thieves knocked out power by trying to cut through live wires to steal copper . 	0
Drink them up like fine wine . 	0
They were easier to find , but not alive to press charges against . 	0

On a more serious note I can understand the argument that " homosexuals are unrepentant sinners " but so are people on their second marriage . 	1
Matthew 19 : 9 " Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except for immorality , and marries another commits adultery . ” 	0
Fuuuck I want to marry you and your hair . 	0
Quite possibly , I DO NOT RECALL . 	0
Yep , way way preachy but you don ' t need anyone and neither do I . Sticking around for a need is worse than leaving . 	0
I mean how can one call oneself a follower of the teachings of Christ and throw out what he was recorded as saying , while applying Old Testament standards intended for priests to the general populace . 	0
They all steal some of his bits sooner or later anyway . 	0
I still think Stern is funnier than them all . 	1
I know none of these people - I ' ll stick with Eddie Izzard , Stephen Fry and Billy Connelly thanks : ) 	0

I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1
It crashes a lot in the middle of big uploads , which is very frustrating . 	0
Not a single one . 	0
Yeah , must be something like that . 	1
I haven ' t , but I ' m hopeless with tunes . 	0
Maybe the Time Lords get hold of him or something . 	0
The Master ' s plan seems to have reached other planets ( Gallifrey for example ) so I guess there ' s no reason it couldn ' t reach wherever Jack is . 	0

You might be right , and if you are , then there ' s no case where Safari would be better for media , other than possibly a projector . 	0
Oh , me too . 	0
My pets are my family , and I cannot honestly fathom anyone who doesn ' t treat their animals that way . 	0
Your doggie < 33 ! 	0
It ' s so good he has a loving home now . 	0
It ' s so unfair the way animals can be treated . 	0
If you ' re not going to love and adore your pet , don ' t get one dammit . 	0

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
Aha ! 	0
Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0
Nice picture , though ! 	0
Omg , that is hilarious . 	0
. 	0
Shit , I should ' ve known that ! 	0
God damn . 	0
I ' ve heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I don ' t see how it couldn ' t , but I ' m betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once . 	0

I just got a call from my mother two minutes ago : " I ' m on my way home from work and I ' m about to pass by IHOP . 	0
Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1
I fucking love IHOP . 	1
Also , for everyone to know my mommy is amazing . 	0

It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1

Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
Kid won , of course . ) 	0
( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep . 	1
He ' s been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure . 	0
He wasn ' t eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply wouldn ' t last . 	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came . 	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself . 	0
He was asleep in moments . 	0
The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat . 	0
But he ' s in a far better place , and he was loved every minute of his life . 	0

I value my life more than getting somewhere 5 mins faster . . . . and really thats the most u would make from lane swapping and riding between them etc . You dont make up as much time as you would think once you do the calculations . 	0

Moreso than the molestation , though , I hate the two of them for the distance that I keep with my family on the whole . 	0

But mistaking your external drive for the ( extremely ) expendable , empty drive that you ' re slaving just to format ? 	0

Today , I count myself among those ranks . 	1

So in conclusion , California would rather give rights to animals , and take them away from gays . 	1
But alas , they don ' t learn from their lessons ( or maybe they have and would rather be the people that continue the cycle ) . 	0
Of all people that I would have hoped to understand the plight of the repressed minority , I thought the African-American community would have understood . 	0
While California overwhelmingly voted for Obama , Obama also did not support passage of Prop 8 , despite supposed distaste for gay marriage . 	0
Even if it is expensive , at least it ' ll provide jobs and a really cool engineering marvel that the other industrialized countries enjoy now . 	0
But if nothing else , we ' ll get that high speed rail that joins San Francisco with San Diego . 	0
Not everyone lives in a supportive and happy-go-lucky family , and I ' m glad it didn ' t pass . 	0
The only real social highlights I would consider reasonable was the rejection of the parental notification of a minor ' s abortion . 	1
When I had orientation at my Air Force base in Cheyenne , they warned us not to talk about our jobs out with strangers out at the bars , because some of the strangers were KGB agents . 	0
Yeah , after having to encounter a ton of people I just want to GET AWAY and it ' s not really understood in American culture where being quiet and wanting to be alone is supposed to always be a cause for concern . 	0

Just gotta keep telling myelf that I scanned this all in , so it ' s still recoverable , I didn ' t lose anything permanently except hours of work but it ' s not gone forever , etc , etc . Agh , damn , my brain . 	0
This is driving me insane ! 	0
that ' s on the hard drive , having the recovered file be about the same size as the old one , and then it just can ' t be opened . 	0

It ' s terribly frustrating to be able to see every . 	0
Everything I ' ve recovered so far has been corrupted , so hopefully I ' ll have better luck with a different sort of scan . 	0

Melissa and I are in the Burgundy region of France right now and recently saw a flier about a group of workers building a medieval castle in this area using only period materials and techniques . 	0
There ' s some information about it here . 	0
It might be really cool to visit , but unfortunately , it ' s kind of expensive ( $15 ) and too far out of our way . 	0
Still , it ' s an awesome idea . 	0
Instead , we had to content ourselves today with visiting the hillside where St . Bernard preached the Second Crusade in 1146 before the assembled nobility of France and 100 , 000 pilgrims . 	0
And we ate some really terrific boeuf Borginoine ( or some such spelling ) . 	0

They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0
Our two shepherds ( a ) never enter into pointless marriages , realizing ( if only internally ) that this can ' t possibly match the level of passion they ' ve shared . 	0
The survivor puts the property up for sale , and vanishes into the sunset . . . . 	0
After some time of being excruciatingly careful , one of the two winds up being ambushed , his partner arriving just that much too late , and the one dies in the other ' s arms . 	0
You can still have all the societal disapproval ( once it turns out they ' re not JUST business partners . . . ) and the brutal death , etc . and so on . 	0
OK , so I ' m throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something . 	0
They don ' t have to be " gay " , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID . 	0
I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

Feminism isn ' t about knowing the answers , it ' s about trying to find them . 	0
It ' s a bit stream-of-consciousness ( as the title warns ) , but there ' s a good deal of sense in it . 	0
There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0

So far we ' ve watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 . 	0
Season 7 was amazing ! 	1
We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are . 	0
Unfortunately , I had only seen 14-19 and Matt had only seasons 18 & 19 . 	0
We can get seasons 11-now on itunes . 	0
But what about seasons 3-6 ? 	0
There are so many great people with intense ( good & bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and it ' s all pirate themed . 	0
I can find them online for free but the quality is TERRIBLE ! 	0
Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0

But fight the fight for me ? 	0
Not friggin ' likely . 	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0

Pentax have tried to enter the digital market without really looking at what a camera needs to be worth having , and until they come up with soething far better than what I have used and seen from them so far , I would avoid spending money on one . 	0

mshollie and I enjoyed seeing " The Princess and the Frog " yesterday . 	0
As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0
I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
Conjures up some beautiful imagery . 	0
I really like the second verse . 	1
Gorgeous ! 	0
I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0

The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations . 	0
Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0
If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved . 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we ' re screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out . 	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution . 	0
Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ? 	0
Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc . Yet , we ' re denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to " normal " people . 	0

For instance , on the page opposite the " free and exceptionally gracious " picture , this is what it says : After all , about the greatest difference between you is that boys are made to be the fathers of the world and girls are made to be the mothers . 	0

Passion drove Van Gogh to ruin - while leaving amazing paintings in its wake . 	0
Passionate architects gave us buildings like the Eiffel Tower , the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building . 	0

In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
And there are many measures for that . 	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0

and why the hell hasn ' t australia , or britian , or germany , or any other of america ' s allies got on the horn and said that if they don ' t force israel to hold a ceasefire then they ' ll pull of out their wonderfully conducted art of propaganda otherwise known as the war on terror ? 	1

This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0
How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ? 	0

Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
I also get treated badly by my managers . 	0

I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
So marked . 	0
But it seems much to long to wait ! 	0
I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
catalina = yes . 	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings . 	0

I think you ' re good with the honesty , but I agree with one of the posters above where sometimes it seems too confrontational and it could be taken too seriously . 	0
this isn ' t about good or bad . 	0
my subjective feeling is that a republican vote is harmful to this country . 	0

i really don ' t care if you agree with me or not . 	0
i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
But , anyway , yeah . 	0
Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0

In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0

Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0

COMMENT TO BE ADDED . 	0
By your logic , the only people who can " legitimately " comment on the story / movie are bi shepherds who ' ve spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock . 	0
I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0
I grew up in semi-rural Oregon - no , not WAY out in the middle of nowhere , but far , far from being a " big city . " 	0
I stand by what I ' ve said about the story and the movie . 	0

Ian Anderson ' s passion for music has given us some incredible albums . 	0
Jim Henson ' s passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love . 	0
Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0
Nada . 	0
What does that " force " accomplish in the story ? 	0
Zilch . 	0
Zip . 	0
To me , that makes no sense ; passion drives people to strive for things , even if they fail . 	0

Which is why I stuck mostly to calling buddy on the underlying sexism in how he was participating - refutation of his arguments just didn ' t seem to have enough of a constructive return , either for the debate as it was shaping before he came along , or for me . 	0

I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0

I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0

" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
Nevertheless , if I ' ve parsed this right , I ' m more radical than not . 	0
