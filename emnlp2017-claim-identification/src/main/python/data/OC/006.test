Given that police were actively dissuaded from investigating the crimes , criminals were shuffled around to avoid repercussions and make the trail harder to follow , and given it took place in multiple nations , all while higher-ups reassured people that no such thing was happening . . .

I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0

Feminism isn ' t about knowing the answers , it ' s about trying to find them . 	0
It ' s a bit stream-of-consciousness ( as the title warns ) , but there ' s a good deal of sense in it . 	0
There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0
Yeah , because it makes sense for an entire race to all have the same haircut . 	0

However , you can ' t do that with everyone . 	0
well being honest with some people is good . 	0
but since you don ' t like the " best friend " idea . 	0
I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0
Ermm . . . 	0
I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
Why ? 	0
Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1
I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it ' s really no big deal . 	0

True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0
mmm I ' m home tomorrow sometime after 6 / 7 , wanna come round then ? 	0
