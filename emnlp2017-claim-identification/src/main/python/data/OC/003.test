I listed stuff last night ( a bunch of short dresses ) and already there is an increase of traffic and watchers on the new stuff listed . 	0
I think things will pick up . 	1
People also don ' t like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two . 	0
It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let ' s face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) . 	1
I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout / background , user ID ) because of the slowness / lower number of hits on my auctions . 	0
This was a slow week right from the start . 	0

It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1
I have the flour and the sugar , so that ' s set . 	0

About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep . 	1
He ' s been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure . 	0
He wasn ' t eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply wouldn ' t last . 	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came . 	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself . 	0
He was asleep in moments . 	0
The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat . 	0
But he ' s in a far better place , and he was loved every minute of his life . 	0
Can ' t ask more than that . 	0

But , whatever difference there may be in what men and women do , and in what we expect of them , these differences depend primarily on their different functions as parents . 	0
Aw . 	0
For instance , on the page opposite the " free and exceptionally gracious " picture , this is what it says : After all , about the greatest difference between you is that boys are made to be the fathers of the world and girls are made to be the mothers . 	0
Because the fathers need to be the protectors , boys are stronger and perhaps more forward and daring than girls . 	0

Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
Plain . 	0
Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
And there are many measures for that . 	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0

This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0

You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0

By your logic , the only people who can " legitimately " comment on the story / movie are bi shepherds who ' ve spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock . 	0
I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0
