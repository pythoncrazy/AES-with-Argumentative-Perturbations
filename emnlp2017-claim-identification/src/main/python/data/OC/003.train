Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
I hear you more clearly . 	0
I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
Does that make any sense ? 	0
Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
Yes . 	1
Well , frankly ? 	0
The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

if your hair is dirty ( and unteased ) spray some dry shampoo through it first , then try teasing two or three times . 	0
also - try teasing twice / thrice on clean hair . 	0

as a person with a folklore degree , they ' re kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly can ' t recall which ) . 	0
really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were " created " so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them . 	0
they ' re really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo . 	0
they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1
all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth . 	0
it saddens me that folklore ' s basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness . 	0
in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much . 	0
( although they ' re incorrectly implying partial differentiation ) 	0
it ' s differentiation with respect to x not division by x . 	0

if you think your opinion is better than carders , then why dont you go tell him yourself and quit whining about it here . 	0
im sure he ' d be FASCINATED to hear about it . just because you didnt get drum major , doesnt mean the band is going to be bad . 	0

so next time you think youre going to go complain about someone because they got the job you wanted , or for any other dumb reason , maybe you should think that maybe theres a reason they got it . you know , beacuase theyre fit for the job , theyre the best qualified , and everyone knows that they can handle it . dont even start complaining about her anymore . 	0

Oh , there is so much more to comics than X-Men . 	0
At that point , I hadn ' t read it in years and years , preferring darker and more mature comics . 	0
I agree , I think the movie was what ultimately turned me off to picking X-Men back up . . 	0
The first is a parody of the old Hinterland Who ' s Who ( Canadian posters will get this one ) It even sounds like the guy who used to narrate them . 	0
Now I ' m sure many of you have seen this one . . . 	0

The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0
I hope they go into the development of the cult of Saxon or w / e that was , it was really sudden . 	0

What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0
( although it does lead to humourous hittings of the öä keys instead of what I was going for , along with adds like the one in my icon ) Hope all is well with you ^_^ 	0

After you kill Arthas , there ' s this long RP / cinematic where Bolvar Fordragon , whom Arthas had captured and tortured , took up the helm and sword and became the new Lich King so that Azeroth wouldn ' t go cablooey . 	0

I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
Aha ! 	0
Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0
Nice picture , though ! 	0

Shit , I should ' ve known that ! 	0
God damn . 	0
I ' ve heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I don ' t see how it couldn ' t , but I ' m betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once . 	0

I just got a call from my mother two minutes ago : " I ' m on my way home from work and I ' m about to pass by IHOP . 	0
Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1

( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

I doubt it was her boyfriends fantasy . . . more her own - you know like one of those teenage experiments that everyone seems to have to have whether they are certain about their sexuality or not . 	1
If you haven ' t seen that girl for so long , then I can see why it looks hopeless . 	0
As if it isn ' t difficult enough to start a relationship with someone of the same sex , all that teasing and leading you on confuses the hell out of you . 	0
That has got to be one of the cruelest things that a straight person can do to someone gay / bi . 	1

So in conclusion , California would rather give rights to animals , and take them away from gays . 	1
But alas , they don ' t learn from their lessons ( or maybe they have and would rather be the people that continue the cycle ) . 	0
Of all people that I would have hoped to understand the plight of the repressed minority , I thought the African-American community would have understood . 	0
While California overwhelmingly voted for Obama , Obama also did not support passage of Prop 8 , despite supposed distaste for gay marriage . 	0
Even if it is expensive , at least it ' ll provide jobs and a really cool engineering marvel that the other industrialized countries enjoy now . 	0
But if nothing else , we ' ll get that high speed rail that joins San Francisco with San Diego . 	0
Not everyone lives in a supportive and happy-go-lucky family , and I ' m glad it didn ' t pass . 	0

Melissa and I are in the Burgundy region of France right now and recently saw a flier about a group of workers building a medieval castle in this area using only period materials and techniques . 	0
There ' s some information about it here . 	0
It might be really cool to visit , but unfortunately , it ' s kind of expensive ( $15 ) and too far out of our way . 	0
Still , it ' s an awesome idea . 	0
Instead , we had to content ourselves today with visiting the hillside where St . Bernard preached the Second Crusade in 1146 before the assembled nobility of France and 100 , 000 pilgrims . 	0

They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0

The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc . " 	0
Mother Nature : pain in the ass , or super-hot MILF ? 	0
" They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet ' s insecurity since the election of Bush , " she told La Presse . 	0
Full article . 	0
CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0
This is already a champ , and should become an even mightier one . 	0

There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0

A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable . 	0
After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1
And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch . 	0
The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

I was so confused by this episode and it actually hurt my head a little bit . 	1
Enh . . . given that part of the job of Holy Mother Church is to protect the common man from the influence of the Adversary , saying that he has taken control of leaders of the Church isn ' t exactly good CYA - particularly from the head of the folks in charge of recognizing and rebuking his manifestations . 	1

I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0
( And when we get back to the barracks . . . um , never mind . ) 	0
But fight the fight for me ? 	0
Not friggin ' likely . 	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

Well , it ' s not as simple as " pray against it " . 	0

At one point I had no internal fan at all and the cooling mat still kept it running nicely until I found and eradicated the capitalistware that kept turning off the internal fan to try and make me buy a new laptop . 	0
So I have one of those cooling mat things that circulates the air under the laptops vents and runs off the USB . . . 	0

  And you are keeping the really really old cars on the road .   Plus you are creating economic hardship for the lower income folks .   	0

  You don ' t want to take the " nicer " used cars off the road .   What are the lower income people going to drive ?   These are the cars they would have bought used .   Now they are going to be forced into driving even older cars .   You take all the " nicer " used cars off the road and destroy them . . .   You are not improving the enviorment .   You are just creating hardship for the lower income people . 	1

( On the flip side , I also know some men who ' ve been devastated by their girlfriends having abortions--and going " tough noogies sperm donor , you don ' t own her " is just not the answer I can give a close friend who ' s grieving because he thought he would be a father . ) 	0
I don ' t know an entirely good solution though . 	0
Obviously you can ' t allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy . 	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden . 	0
Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv . 	0
I ' m actually not sure about this issue . 	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life . 	0
But the idea of someone being forced to be a father doesn ' t make me happy either . 	0

I mean , if you think of " the Devil " as " the personification of evil , or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil " , and sex abuse is evil , and the coverup of evil is evil , and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican , then , well , yes , the Devil is at work inside the Vatican . 	0

Speaking about it later , the subject turned to Tom Lehrer ' s parody of the Major General ' s Song , " The Elements " . 	0
We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0
However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer ' s pieces , I just have to decide which one . 	0
What Tom Lehrer song do you think I should sing ? 	0
Cece and I have been taking voice / singing lessons for a while now : She because she is in a chorus , and me just for fun . 	1
Anyway , our voice teacher held a recital the other week where each of his students performed . 	0
I sang " What a Wonderful World " ( made famous by Louis " Satchmo " Armstrong ) and " Modern Major General " from Gilbert and Sullivan ' s " The Pirates of Penzance " . 	0

If you do go for pentax , I would advise from experience that you get an extended gaurentee . 	1
Pentax have tried to enter the digital market without really looking at what a camera needs to be worth having , and until they come up with soething far better than what I have used and seen from them so far , I would avoid spending money on one . 	0

mshollie and I enjoyed seeing " The Princess and the Frog " yesterday . 	0
As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0
I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
Conjures up some beautiful imagery . 	0
I really like the second verse . 	1
Gorgeous ! 	0
I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we ' re screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out . 	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution . 	0
Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ? 	0
Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc . Yet , we ' re denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to " normal " people . 	0

Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

: / Those who voted for Prop 8 either voted out of fear / discrimination of homosexuals or because they were following what their church told them like sheep . 	0
Never once has it entered their mind that they might be wrecking their fellow Americans ' lives . 	0

i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
But , anyway , yeah . 	0
Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1

Ian Anderson ' s passion for music has given us some incredible albums . 	0
Jim Henson ' s passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love . 	0
Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0
Nada . 	0
What does that " force " accomplish in the story ? 	0
Zilch . 	0
Zip . 	0
To me , that makes no sense ; passion drives people to strive for things , even if they fail . 	0
Nothing . 	0

Just out of curiosity , for LJ-cut in this entry ( http://fakingit.livejournal.com/89838.html# ) , did you use traditional , or simplified Chinese , or Japanese , and what , in English , does it mean ? 	0
Which is why I stuck mostly to calling buddy on the underlying sexism in how he was participating - refutation of his arguments just didn ' t seem to have enough of a constructive return , either for the debate as it was shaping before he came along , or for me . 	0
But , yeah , I don ' t call everybody on everything - life ' s too short . 	0
Actually , I was thinking of your ability to call me on things , if I need it . 	0
You could be right about context failure ; he did seem to have a lot of " regurgitate the party line " going on . 	0

But I ' m also concerned with the other ways - not necessarily directly related to cash flow - that single moms often get hung out to dry . 	0

But you should be able to follow this link and get a page with a link to YepRoc ' s Goodnight Oslo page , which has an audio stream of the record . 	0
Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1

        Some other opinions of the Other Annie Proulx Movie® : Eherensteinland , David Ehrenstein at HuffingtonPost , and Adam Mars-Jones at Guardian Unlimited . 	0
        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
I ' m so happy you ' ve decided as such . 	0
This is a great , great record . 	1
I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

To stave off heart-attack-inducing shock , he pretty much has to find evidence that it was something larger than the people involved , and thus has to turn himself ' round the bend to live with himself . 	0

I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0

What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
WTF ? 	0
Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0

I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0

Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
It ' s not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid ' s a demon , the animation is beautiful . 	0

" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
