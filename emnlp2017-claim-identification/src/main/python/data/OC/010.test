Now would be a good time for folks to send a few dollars to Bachmann ' s opponent , who seems like a good guy , even aside from the fact that he ' s most emphatically not Michele Bachmann . 	0

I especially like the environment in this one ! 	0
And just to annoy you , here ' s the quote of the day : " Time to put the mental in judgemental ! " 	0
-my bffl 	0
And I know the Bible way better than them . 	0
And that last paragraph made no sense at all . 	0
I meant all the things you thought I did wrong , which actually weren ' t wrong . 	0
Smart is sexy . 	1
I have been handed this decision in the past , and have always , always chosen the smart one . 	0
Period . 	0
All-nighter rambling stream-of-consciousness conversations are hotter than ANY face / body combo . 	0
Always ( for me ) . 	0
Plus I sometimes hate those damn things . 	0
Sorry , just a very enthusiastic reaction to linguistic accuracy . 	0
Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
I hear you more clearly . 	0
I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
Does that make any sense ? 	0
Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0
And I meant ghosts that just go around haunting houses and stuff , not spirits sent from God . 	0
Your preference for rationalism will be severely challenged depending on how the professor approaches the subject . 	0
Barring a clear choice based on teachers , however , you might want to save Buddhism for a later part of your undergraduate career . 	0
Barring that , I would first go with your instincts based on your knowledge ( direct or by reputation ) of the philosophy professors teaching those classes if you want to choose between the two . 	0
Actually , an intro to Taoism would be a great match with your quantum physics class , if available . 	1
You end up working too hard , burning yourself out , and your knowledge level for all classes goes down . ) 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we ' re screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out . 	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution . 	0
Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ? 	0
Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc . Yet , we ' re denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to " normal " people . 	0

Best headline ever from the front page of today ' s AJC : DEATH STILL ARBITRARY 	0
I don ' t think this movie was shelved so much because of it ' s being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done . 	1
I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
It ' s not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid ' s a demon , the animation is beautiful . 	0
