CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0

Passion drove Van Gogh to ruin - while leaving amazing paintings in its wake . 	0
Passionate architects gave us buildings like the Eiffel Tower , the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building . 	0
But my main objection to the story seems to me to be this basic structural element - passion is a dynamic , driving force and in Brokeback Mountain it just . . . does nothing . 	0
Perhaps there ' s some personalization sneaking in here - I may not be entirely objective . 	0
Oh , but excavation hurt is the best kind ! 	0

Ian Anderson ' s passion for music has given us some incredible albums . 	0
Jim Henson ' s passion for his work gave us the Muppets , characters that millions of people love . 	0
Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0
Nada . 	0
What does that " force " accomplish in the story ? 	0
Zilch . 	0
Zip . 	0
To me , that makes no sense ; passion drives people to strive for things , even if they fail . 	0
Nothing . 	0

I don ' t think this movie was shelved so much because of it ' s being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done . 	1
I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
It ' s not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid ' s a demon , the animation is beautiful . 	0

Would you rather have someone who is breathtakingly beautiful ( we ' re talking the hottest thing you have ever seen , pick your jaw up off the floor hot ) but spectacularly dumb ( as in , you can ' t use words more than two syllables around them without having to explain yourself ) , or Someone who is downright plain ( and that ' s being kind ) but is utterly brillant , with whom you can have sparkling conversations and they teach you all sorts of things ? 	0

It just really yanks my chain that some stupid americans would be so self-righteous to think that we would give a shit about their petty protest , even though they have contributed more to destabilize the planet than any other human act . 	0
