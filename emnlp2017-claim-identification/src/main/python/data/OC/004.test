I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0
( And when we get back to the barracks . . . um , never mind . ) 	0

Not friggin ' likely . 	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0

mshollie and I enjoyed seeing " The Princess and the Frog " yesterday . 	0
As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0

I suspect this has to do with a keyboard-interface-related mental trigger - certainly my phrasings , and I ' m pretty sure my debative skills and tactics , become sharper and more precise , when I ' m resisting the temptation to descend into ad hominem arson ( " I may be a skunk , but you ' re a piece of junk . 	0
Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories : 1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil . 	0

Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0

In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0

maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1
it may just be fear . 	0
        Some other opinions of the Other Annie Proulx Movie® : Eherensteinland , David Ehrenstein at HuffingtonPost , and Adam Mars-Jones at Guardian Unlimited . 	0
        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
This is a great , great record . 	1
I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

It ' s really more of " does Jenn see you as hot , adorable , fugly , etc ? " 	0
Note : hot / not does not mean " would do / would not do " unless specified otherwise . 	0
The usual - you comment , and I tell you what Jenn thinks of you , and if she thinks / would think you ' re hot / not / not applicable ! 	0
Relationship meme and hot / not meme ALL IN ONE ! 	0
Um , if I forget anything or get something wrong , feel free to tell me so - I have the memory of that small fish swimmy thing with the shiny scales and the no memory . 	0

I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

What I want you to do is a post a confession in a comment . 	0
Anonymous commenting is turned ON ( it always is , but okay ) . 	0
Even me , but post anonymously . 	0
It can be about anything at all . 	0
Has there ever been something you ' ve always wanted to tell me , or anyone else ? 	0
It can be a deep , dark confession , or something just completely random . 	0
Post as often as you want , and I will most likely reply , so you may want to check back . 	0
It looks great . 	0
Oh , that was me , by the way . 	0
i added you . 	0
i think because of the " Huzzah " s . . . . or maybe because of the NC-17 rating . . . it could have been the uber-entertaining writing too . . . most likely tho , it ' s just plain old jellousy . 	0

* flexes * The bad news : Pretty much everything else ! 	0
I ' ve only seen a couple of episodes of Castle , and so far I ' m ambivalent about it , but I am tickled to death that he was issued a bulletproof vest that says WRITER in place of the usual POLICE or FBI . 	0
Yes , very much so ! 	0
I ' m hoping by the end of next year to finish everything else he ' s written . 	0

It was me and two other people , and basically the interviewer just sat us down in a room and asked us questions , and we ' d take turns answering , and at times she ' d ask us questions that just pertained to ourselves that the others didn ' t have to answer . 	0

idk there was also someone who thought that one of the people with their faces covered in the hall of Time Lords was Captain Jack , but the hair doesn ' t look right . 	0
Though according to Wikipedia , she ' s not Romana , she ' s the Doctor ' s mother ? 	0
If you look at the comments on the ONTD posts , people are throwing all sorts of stuff out there , like Romana coming back . 	0
Yeah , I don ' t know . 	0
The best I can come up with is that the Time Lords are trying to unlock the Time War and are manipulating the Master and the green people to repair Gallifrey . 	0
" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
Nevertheless , if I ' ve parsed this right , I ' m more radical than not . 	0

On the other hand , if I wanted to see just " Yojimbo " on its own and make more of an evening of it maybe the later showing would be better . . . * puzzles * 	0
The 5 : 25 " Yojimbo " might be a bit too tight time-wise , but if I wanted to make a double-bill of it and " Sanjuro " it ' d probably have to be that way around . 	0
