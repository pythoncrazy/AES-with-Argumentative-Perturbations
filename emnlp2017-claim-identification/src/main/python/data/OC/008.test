It ' s by the Beatles . 	1
I forgot the name of the song though . 	0
I know because I only listen to the Beatles and Weezer , and it ' s definitely the Beatles . 	0
OMGZ I COULD ACTUALLY COMMENT ON MEGGIE ' S POST BECAUSE I ' M USUALLY A SUPER-TARD WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 	0

would definitely like to learn japanese and german for travel purposes . 	0
i ' ve got it down in english and spanish ( which i ' ve apparently absorbed ) . 	0
Me too ! 	0

Because when I first heard it I was like " WTF ? 	0
Gwen made a new song already ? ? ? " 	0
When we saw them last weekend they made the announcement that Greg would not be participating right before the show , and made it sound like he woke up sick that morning . 	0
This is weird . 	0
I had no idea he has been sick for so long . 	1
The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
Yes . 	1
Well , frankly ? 	0
The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0
would anyone be interested in custom made wooden and / or acrylic dildos carved and finished by me and ill be giving a few away for reviews . 	0
I know i just had this idea and I thought either im nuts or its a good idea . 	0
Most of the people you insulted know more about the bible than you ) Maybe one day you ' ll learn to question things and not accept every little thing you are told to believe . 	0
Then go cram your twisted views of the bible down someone elses throat ( yes they are twisted . 	0
I never could stand narrow-minded , ignorant bigots and I only put up with you because you are young . 	0
Until then , leave this bisexual pagan to ' sin ' in peace . 	0
Go do some soul searcching and grow up . 	0
You had me at Endor . 	0
Oh , like you didn ' t have a reason before , huh ? 	0
It ' s more a case of ' this priest knows this archbishop / bishop / cardinal and uses his friendship to skate clear ' . 	0
To define as a conspiracy , I would need something like the Cabal of Underground Sex Cardinals coordinating the moving of abusive priests to finance their porn industry or similar . 	0
For it to be a conspiracy there has to be a guiding force , a cabal behind the whole thing . 	0
There are no real ' ringleaders ' in all of the abuse cases I ' ve seen , even here in the USA . 	0

The DOMA part I can understand , but the temporary memo vs order thing is just pure insult . 	0

What happened to the Senate , however , shows that Republicans lost seats despite social conservatives having a larger majority of this year ' s vote . 	0
The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is . 	0

I don ' t even know what it is that makes me miss it because I hate it when I am there . . . but I just miss the smell of non-city life , crunching through leaves in my yard , having the freedom of a car . 	0

CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0
Beautiful . 	1
Yup , they played the bucket 	0

i need to post this and maybe it ' s not making a lot of sense to you right now , but if you ' re a smoker or a previous smoker who has quit then this will make sense . 	0

Somehow , I think that bringing cocktail sausages to a party of sods would lead to much deserved heckling . 	0
Nevermind . 	0
OKAY : ) 	0
i refuse to cull them because they fascinate me , and somehow still put up with my shit on their friends page daily . 	1
so i never know what to say , so for the sake of not insulting anybody i don ' t say anything at all . . . i ' m amazed that there are people with journals out there who haven ' t culled me sooner . 	1
when you ' re so far away it ' s just so fucking hard to imagine yourself into someone ' s life . 	0
it appears ___dash___ has culled me . i ' m not sure if i blame him , considering i ' m not very responsive to some of his entries . 	1

So much to do , and yet still enough time to color-code a list of all the things to do . 	0
Clearly , you aren ' t busy enough . 	1
( On the flip side , I also know some men who ' ve been devastated by their girlfriends having abortions--and going " tough noogies sperm donor , you don ' t own her " is just not the answer I can give a close friend who ' s grieving because he thought he would be a father . ) 	0
I don ' t know an entirely good solution though . 	0
Obviously you can ' t allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy . 	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden . 	0
Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv . 	0
I ' m actually not sure about this issue . 	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life . 	0
But the idea of someone being forced to be a father doesn ' t make me happy either . 	0
Dammit . 	0

Because they printed on a very cheap grade of paper they tended to go for high contrast saturated colours ( that then got greyed down by the paper ) . . . but it ' s the * choice * of colours too , somehow the aesthetic is very much of that time and place . 	0

Speaking about it later , the subject turned to Tom Lehrer ' s parody of the Major General ' s Song , " The Elements " . 	0
We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0
However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer ' s pieces , I just have to decide which one . 	0
What Tom Lehrer song do you think I should sing ? 	0
Cece and I have been taking voice / singing lessons for a while now : She because she is in a chorus , and me just for fun . 	1
Anyway , our voice teacher held a recital the other week where each of his students performed . 	0
I sang " What a Wonderful World " ( made famous by Louis " Satchmo " Armstrong ) and " Modern Major General " from Gilbert and Sullivan ' s " The Pirates of Penzance " . 	0
I was a bit stressed out , not only for performing a demanding piece before an audience , but also because it was also the final week of School ( though I think I ended up doing pretty well ) . 	1

in many ways mom and dad splitting was not normal . . . they remained friends until he remarried , and now it ' s just awkward for them to talk much . . . 	0

The only good solution is for both partners to participate in birth control , but when that doesn ' t happen . . . 	0
I just don ' t know . 	0
No , a pregnant woman doesn ' t need a man , but she kinda does need ( or at least massively benefit from ) the time and money contributions of a second person . 	0
I just can ' t think of a pat and equitable solution under that constraint . 	0

They ' re currently working on our house , but should be done and looking for a new project in February or March . . . 	0
: ) If you want an expert , though , we have a pair of carpenters that did a floor in my old landlord ' s apartment , and it looked beautiful . 	0
My sympathies and love are with you both . 	0

Let people see this delightful movie thats full of morality stories and great songs . 	0
American culture has a spotted past , the best way to accept it and move on is to embrace it . 	0
Basically the folks who want to cry racism and what not are blithering idiots who never managed to open their minds enough to see what this movie was about . 	0
