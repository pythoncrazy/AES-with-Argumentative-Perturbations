There is also a group rallying against our practices with sheep ! ! ! 	0
( Sheep have a flap of ' foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they ' re writting letters to us demanding we ban it . 	0
They ' ve got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I ' ve seen so far . 	0
AND THEY dare to say they aren ' t going to holiday here because seals are being killed ! ! 	0
Don ' t get me wrong Chris , I couldn ' t kill anything - I think . 	0

If there ' s this massive " passion " between these two characters something should happen with it - - people throughout history have risked worse for lust and love . 	0
Perhaps , but he ' s also quite right . 	0
I have never understood the furor over this tawdry little story ; it ' s tedious , it ' s depressing and ultimately unnecessary . 	1
To borrow from a radically different genre , I grab two words from the world of Babylon 5 - FAITH MANAGES . 	0
I ' ve always believed in the definition of love as " the state where someone else ' s well-being means more to you than your own " - and that definition clearly does NOT hold in this story . 	0
As a chronicle of how many people with gay / bi tendencies have been stunted by societal expectations , it ' s great . 	0
The one thing it ' s not is a love story - which is how the blind masses singing its praises describe it . 	1
You wanna talk about social pressure ? 	0
It seems like if one states publically an opinion like mine , it ' s near to instant pariah-hood that one isn ' t worshipping at the altar of this unctious little travesty . 	0

It ' s OK that you disagree , but your disagreement doesn ' t make conflicting points of view any less valid than your own . . . and the impression you give is that you take offense because people disagree with you . 	0
People pushing back is not making you a pariah . . . it ' s saying that many of us see value that you don ' t wish to see , and that many of us see love as a LOT more than just valuing someone else ' s well-being more than your own . . . or having a rough fuck . 	0

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0

Melissa and I are in the Burgundy region of France right now and recently saw a flier about a group of workers building a medieval castle in this area using only period materials and techniques . 	0
There ' s some information about it here . 	0
It might be really cool to visit , but unfortunately , it ' s kind of expensive ( $15 ) and too far out of our way . 	0
Still , it ' s an awesome idea . 	0
Instead , we had to content ourselves today with visiting the hillside where St . Bernard preached the Second Crusade in 1146 before the assembled nobility of France and 100 , 000 pilgrims . 	0
And we ate some really terrific boeuf Borginoine ( or some such spelling ) . 	0

Feminism isn ' t about knowing the answers , it ' s about trying to find them . 	0
It ' s a bit stream-of-consciousness ( as the title warns ) , but there ' s a good deal of sense in it . 	0
There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0
And you ' re right about that fundamental problem . 	1
Here we have a more recent favorite of mine . . . 	0
My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0
it hurts ) . 	0

By your logic , the only people who can " legitimately " comment on the story / movie are bi shepherds who ' ve spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock . 	0
I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

I really don ' t know what the RA could have done about that , but it was very irritating , and brought about many passive-aggressive notes stuck on fridge with magnets . 	0
this year my main concerns are structural ( size of room , will the stairs make me tired , where is the kitchen , TV , laundry etc . ) and not related to RAs that I can figure . 	0
She didn ' t just copy and paste in info or messages , but started out with nice words about whatever time of the semester it was and then got to the purpose of writing . 	0
she also would say hello sometimes , ask how we were doing , but I never felt like I was being detained when I was trying to get something else done ( like walking by and getting sucked in . . . which is a common dorm problem in general . ) probably the worst thing that happened on my hall last year was that people were constantly getting their food stolen from the fridge . 	0
That name was familiar but I had to Google it to know who you were talking about . 	0
