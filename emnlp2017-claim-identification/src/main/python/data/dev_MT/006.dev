That ' s why intelligence services must be regulated in the framework of parliamentary oversight committees . 	1
Of course a certain level of secrecy is the basis for the work of intelligence services . 	0
The unregulated work of the secret services , however , carries the danger of misuse of their authority . 	0
Intelligence services apparently enjoy indiscriminate liberties . 	0
No one can follow their activities in detail . 	0
It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team . 	1
He ' s just not a team player , and often goes it alone . 	0
Plus he comes to training way too rarely , although he plays very well without training . 	0
But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee . 	0
The current tour of Tokio Hotel is breaking all records . 	1
Never have there been longer queues at the advance ticket offices – in Japan there was one exceeding 3 . 2km – aside from , perhaps , during the heyday of Take That . 	0
But at times even the online sales outlets haven ' t been coping with the demand . 	0
Having said that , state funds are often wasted on nonsensical investments , so that this ideal appears unworthy of support in many ways . 	0
Besides , the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain . 	0
It is desirable that no one channels his or her wealth past the tax authorities . 	0
Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible . 	0
Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state . 	1
For , due to the low birth rate , the proportion of the elderly population and with it pension costs are on the rise , and furthermore , due to today ' s healthcare most people in many occupations are fitter for work in old age than before . 	0
Although the workload is getting heavier in many professions and physical and psychological wear on personnel is steadily increasing , the statutory retirement age should in the future not remain at 63 years . 	1
This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society , which may reduce discrimination of financially and / or socially disadvantaged children . 	0
School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again . 	1
Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one ' s individuality but what ' s really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community , which would possibly be strengthened by an equal , collective appearance . 	0
Furthermore , it would facilitate the finding of truants , who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school . 	0
Retirement at 63 , that ' s something everyone who has toiled away ( nonstop ) up to this point surely deserves . 	0
Only the question remains whether this early ' leisure ' will be nicer if you have no idea what do to all day and you statistically still have almost 20 ( ! ! ! ) years to go ? 	0
Also , one isn ' t taking responsibility for society if one gives up one ' s experienced , healthy and highly qualified capabilities earlier than necessary for private / personal reasons . 	0
Especially now , as there is a lack of skilled labour , it ' s irresponsible for the economy and prosperity to retire at 63 . 	1
Always having to visit the doctor first ( including travel and waiting time , possible embarrassment , etc . ) leads to more unwanted pregnancies . 	0
Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor ' s and many women take it unnecessarily . 	0
Being a pharmacist myself , I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies . 	1
From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse . 	0
However , the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors . 	0
Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection , one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level . 	0
A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported . 	1
Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index . 	0
In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts , these are an unattractive investment . 	0
Since however skat , chess etc . are not accepted as Olympic events , computer games should also not be recognized as Olympic events . 	1
Our society is strongly digitized and influenced by computers . 	0
Yet sports are usually associated with physical training . 	0
Olympic events are rooted in old traditions . 	0
On the other hand , the events have a culturally determined character . 	0
But even without an ex-girlfriend he would never touch that . 	0
Ralf does insist that they drank advocaat together . 	0
Thus one of his ex-girlfriends must have been there . 	1
When he got back from Ralf ' s party last night he was still stone-cold sober . 	0
Whenever Peter bumps into an ex-girlfriend at a party , he forgoes any further consumption of alcohol just in case . 	0
Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself . 	0
What , then , ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on although they have taken or destroyed another life ? 	0
Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment . 	1
If there were capital punishment , this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives . 	0
Yes , for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one ' s own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection . 	0
Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver , no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used . 	0
However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device . 	0
The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters . 	1
After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work . 	0
