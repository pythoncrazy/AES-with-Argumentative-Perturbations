But once a safeguard has been found against a new virus , everyone gets it in no time through the automatic update . 	0

Anti-virus software protects the users of a computer from dangers from the internet . 	0
Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops . 	1
Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays , then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already . 	0

But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn ' t actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment ? 	0
Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation . 	0
One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . 	0
German universities should on no account charge tuition fees . 	1
