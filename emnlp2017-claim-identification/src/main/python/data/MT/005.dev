In individual cases they may indeed act as a deterrent , in general , however , a clean environment and the role model effect of others is more likely to motivate the dog owner to pick up the droppings than a potential fine . 	0
Higher penalties for dog dirt are pointless as long as there is not enough personnel to enforce them . 	1
Every German citizen has a right to education . 	0
Quality at universities has its price , which is why students also ought to be involved in this cost factor . 	0
But education must not be a question of money in a wealthy society such as Germany . 	0
Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany . 	1
Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent , lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners . 	1
Of course , first they ' d actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers , but once they have to dig into their pockets , their laziness will sure vanish ! 	0
One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neuk√∂lln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt . 	0
And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many ' land mines ' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles . 	0
After all , secret services tend to develop a life of their own ( a state within a state ) , which would be irresponsible for democratic states . 	0
Secret services must be more tightly regulated in order to prevent excessive surveillance . 	1
Parliamentary control however hampers the work of intelligence services for it jeopardizes the secrecy and security of confidential data and informants . 	0
Besides , intelligence services intervene massively in the privacy of citizens and must therefore be monitored more closely to prevent abuse . 	0
The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers . 	0
I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years . 	1
This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future . 	0
The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire . 	0
This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period . 	0
Energy saving light bulbs contain a significant amount of toxins . 	0
A commercially available bulb may contain for example up to five milligrams of mercury . 	0
That ' s why they should be taken off the market , unless they ' re unbreakable . 	1
But precisely this is unfortunately not the case . 	0
For , due to the low birth rate , the proportion of the elderly population and with it pension costs are on the rise , and furthermore , due to today ' s healthcare most people in many occupations are fitter for work in old age than before . 	0
Although the workload is getting heavier in many professions and physical and psychological wear on personnel is steadily increasing , the statutory retirement age should in the future not remain at 63 years . 	1
But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn ' t actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment ? 	0
Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation . 	0
One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . 	0
German universities should on no account charge tuition fees . 	1
This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place . 	0
It doesn ' t matter after all that those who administer the treatment don ' t have ' doctor status ' . 	0
Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment , since there is a chance of recovery . 	0
Alternative treatments should be subsidized in the same way as conventional treatments , since both methods can lead to the prevention , mitigation or cure of an illness . 	1
