Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person , this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same . 	0
The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany . 	1
For one thing , inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution , and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being . 	0
Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role . 	1
But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis . 	0
The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme . 	0
A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher . 	0
If this carries more weight , many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured . 	0
Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin ' s coffers , but you shouldn ' t bother hoping for that . 	0
Hence the Mayor of Berlin ought to keep the hurdles for organizing such events as low as possible . 	1
Large events that stir national or even international attention attract many visitors , and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors . 	0
They do offer the benefit that the competition over brand-name clothes and the discrimination of the socially weak are prevented . 	0
School uniforms should not be worn in our schools . 	1
Plus such uniforms also stand for ideological conformity and for the suppression of individual self-development . 	0
Nevertheless hardly anyone wishes to dress themselves or their children in a standard uniform . 	0
The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine . 	1
The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone , for that course can only lead to escalation in some form . 	0
Furthermore , Ukraine is culturally and geographically much closer than other countries that the EU ( used to ) get involved with . 	0
Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself , but political power also brings about political responsibility , in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers . 	0
This is also more akin to the real working world later , where performance isn ' t singular , but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods . 	0
The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade . 	0
However , the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly . 	0
That ' s why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade ( 15 out of 120 credits ) . 	0
It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly . 	1
And many a video game is physically and particularly mentally more demanding , when I think of the last FIFA tournament ' s final , than kicking a ball 20 metres . 	0
Plus the hurdle to make video games Olympic events is minimal , as you don ' t even need doping tests , only a neutral console . 	0
Perhaps it is less thrilling for a spectator than for the player , but also for contemporary Olympic events , I recall curling and 50km cross-country skiing , you have to be more than a freak to follow those more properly than only in the roundup of highlights . 	0
It would be fair to make them into an Olympic event . 	1
Video games , namely FIFA in my case , can fascinate young people for hours more intensively and emotionally than any sport in the world ! 	0
If there must be rent increases , there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises . 	0
Rent increases upon re-letting aren ' t bad as such , if it ' s only a small amount , With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat . 	0
That the landlords are then slightly restricted in the administration of their property is not a problem , as they have more pull in the end anyway . 	0
This helps the landlords , as they can adjust their expenses through the increase , and also the tenants , as they can plan for a maximum rent increase . 	1
they ’ re very bad however , if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200 . 	0
Plus , the state wants me to spend my money , and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren ' t open when I ' m off work ? 	0
Well , I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends . 	1
Sure , other people have to work in the shops on the weekend , but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I ' m stuck in the office . 	0
Voters have become more sceptical . 	0
Too many promises have not been kept . 	0
There are parliamentary elections soon and traditionally the governing party is generous with popular promises in the run-up to federal elections . 	0
Nevertheless the head of government , Merkel , had better restrain herself in announcing handouts this year . 	1
Of course it would be nice and simple if after a fun night out with a party acquaintance you could simply take the ' morning-after pill ' and feel at ease . 	0
But it ' s not that simple . 	0
Perhaps a new life was already created that night . 	0
I would kill it without further thought . 	0
That ' s why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory . 	1
