Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease . 	0
Plus everyone has to move approx . 3-10 times in his or her life , because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime . 	0

Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person , this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same . 	0
The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany . 	1
For one thing , inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution , and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being . 	0

I ' m also tired of my data boosting the market value of that corporation . 	0
Facebook warns me emphatically that I may lose contact with my friends . 	0

And many a video game is physically and particularly mentally more demanding , when I think of the last FIFA tournament ' s final , than kicking a ball 20 metres . 	0

It ' s always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship . 	0
Those who study later decide this early on , anyway . 	0
Besides , a higher degree of luxury ( expensive flats ) is not necessary for the majority of the people , but rather a flat at all . 	0
It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents . 	1
A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences . 	1
