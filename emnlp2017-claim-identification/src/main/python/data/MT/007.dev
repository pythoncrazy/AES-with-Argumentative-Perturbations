US series are preferred over “ Tatort ” , and online magazines are turned to instead of the “ Tagesthemen ” . 	0
The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism . 	0
Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence . 	1
Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters . 	0
But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds , the fee quite rightly annoys them . 	0
Since the impact of the morning-after pill is so massive , particularly due to its abortive effect , dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate . 	1
Easy access to the morning-after pill could also result in its appearing to be an easier method than other forms of contraception that , however , have fewer health effects . 	0
The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don ' t do damage to others . 	0
But without a prescription requirement there ' s also no medical advice given before intake . 	0
For instance the morning-after pill could result in a decrease in the use of condoms and thus lead to an increase in new infections with Aids . 	0
Three different bin bags stink away in the kitchen and have to be sorted into different wheelie bins . 	0
Yes , it ' s annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time . 	0
We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation ! 	1
But still Germany produces way too much rubbish and too many resources are lost when what actually should be separated and recycled is burnt . 	0
Pricing pressures are just too high , and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly . 	0
Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible . 	1
Of course he could do another big ad campaign , but that won ' t do the trick if the whole neighbourhood is going down the drain in the end . 	0
Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role . 	1
But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis . 	0
The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme . 	0
A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher . 	0
If this carries more weight , many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured . 	0
Also the scripts are often copied off each other . 	0
That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations ? 	0
What are you paying for , then ? 	0
Curiously , however , there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels . 	0
Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD , ZDF , Arte etc . It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees . 	1
Because for one thing , their products will still sell in bad times , and in addition , such a share is not as sensitive as those of other IT companies . 	0
Although IBM ' s numbers haven ' t been staggering recently , and the mood in the stock market could be better on the whole , you should buy IBM shares if you want to invest . 	1
Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations . 	0
Berlin ' s basketball team has just come out of a sobering season . 	1
Indeed the team ended up third in the league , but given the cost of the star-players one could ' ve expected more . 	0
A sad highlight : Losing 60 : 87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium . 	0
But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn ' t actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment ? 	0
Even without tuition fees half of the student population has to work while studying and hence has less time for studying or recreation . 	0
One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped . 	0
German universities should on no account charge tuition fees . 	1
This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place . 	0
Always having to visit the doctor first ( including travel and waiting time , possible embarrassment , etc . ) leads to more unwanted pregnancies . 	0
Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor ' s and many women take it unnecessarily . 	0
Being a pharmacist myself , I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies . 	1
From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse . 	0
However , the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors . 	0
Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself . 	0
What , then , ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on although they have taken or destroyed another life ? 	0
Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment . 	1
If there were capital punishment , this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives . 	0
Yes , for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one ' s own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection . 	0
The patient could learn to be more aware of his or her body and to treat it more healthily . 	0
This will do little damage to the pharmaceutical industry , and conventional medicine will also hardly suffer . 	0
A reduction in the amount of chemically produced medication per person is most certainly desirable . 	1
From time immemorial humans have had complementary medicine , and it has not generally been ineffective . 	0
