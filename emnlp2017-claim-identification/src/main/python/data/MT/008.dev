It is an asset for the economy . 	0
The negative impact of air traffic however is considerable . 	0
Air traffic is extremely environmentally unfriendly . 	0
But once a safeguard has been found against a new virus , everyone gets it in no time through the automatic update . 	0
Admittedly they do not generally prevent you from catching a virus , since they can only react to publicly known threats . 	0
That ' s why everyone should have an anti-virus programme on his or her Windows machine . 	1
Anti-virus software protects the users of a computer from dangers from the internet . 	0
Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin ' s coffers , but you shouldn ' t bother hoping for that . 	0
Hence the Mayor of Berlin ought to keep the hurdles for organizing such events as low as possible . 	1
Large events that stir national or even international attention attract many visitors , and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors . 	0
As a central airport Berlin Tegel is particularly attractive for business travellers and should by all means remain operational . 	1
Particularly in Tegel , the residents have been bearing the stress of aircraft noise for decades . 	0
Unfortunately this can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases . 	0
Universities are for all citizens , independent of their finances . 	0
Tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities . 	1
If a university lacks the funds , sponsors must be found . 	0
Education and training are fundamental rights which the state , the society must provide . 	0
Indeed , however , it ' s already the case today that students of apparently ' uniform-free ' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments . 	0
Some may find the idea of a school uniform anachronistic , or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions . 	0
A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school , and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power . 	1
This is also more akin to the real working world later , where performance isn ' t singular , but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods . 	0
The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade . 	0
However , the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly . 	0
That ' s why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade ( 15 out of 120 credits ) . 	0
It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly . 	1
Complementary medicine includes treatments with proven health benefits in many areas which are often less costly than medication from conventional medicine , which are also paid for after all . 	0
Often natural treatments do not put as much of a strain on the patient . 	0
Such therapies can frequently result in an improvement in the condition through the active participation of the patient . 	0
The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor ' s decision for natural treatment and also to cover it . 	1
Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair . 	1
Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years . 	0
Thus social security and pension costs are increasing . 	0
Germany ' s aging society is undergoing demographic change , and the age of those who are physically and mentally fit is increasing steadily . 	0
Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments . 	1
Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials , yet it ' s precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional ' western ' medical therapies that ' s been demonstrated as beneficial . 	0
Besides many general practitioners offer such counselling and treatments in parallel anyway - and who would want to question their broad expertise ? 	0
This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society , which may reduce discrimination of financially and / or socially disadvantaged children . 	0
School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again . 	1
Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one ' s individuality but what ' s really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community , which would possibly be strengthened by an equal , collective appearance . 	0
Furthermore , it would facilitate the finding of truants , who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school . 	0
Intelligence services should be more closely regulated by parliament , for , as the most recent NSA wiretapping scandal has shown , the federal state government is allegedly not always familiar with the scope of operations of its intelligence services . 	1
Checks could contribute to restricting the so far rather opaque scope of action of individual services . 	0
Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws , as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders . 	0
But for snap shots that ' s still enough . 	0
I can only recommend the new smartphone XYZ-123 to everyone . 	1
Of course the camera could be better , as it only has mediocre resolution and images in dark surroundings are often snowy . 	0
However , a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence . 	0
If Germany were to introduce the death penalty , convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies . 	0
Handing out capital punishment is unethical . 	0
Plus we don ' t live in medieval times anymore . 	0
We don ' t need it . 	1
' Property entails commitment ' is one of the tenets of our social order . 	0
Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property . 	0
A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone , however , will lead to a further division of society . 	0
The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods . 	0
A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society . 	1
